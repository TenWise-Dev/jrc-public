        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Percutaneous compression plate (PCCP) provides superior anti-rotational abilities and mechanical strength in femoral neck fractures (FNFs). The first series reporting its utilization of FNFs was promising. Since the long-term outcome regarding the implant has not been reported, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term functional outcomes and complications after fixation using PCCP in FNFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2010 to 2019, 51 patients aged from 18 to 87 years were evaluated; 11 patients were excluded from this study. Demographic data, fracture classification, and complications were analyzed. Besides plain radiographs and CT, uptake ratios using bone scintigraphy and/or SPECT were also collected and analyzed. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 4.4 +/- 2.0 years (range, 2-10 years), the mean Harris hip score was 88, with 44 patients (86.3%) achieving excellent or good outcomes. The rate of complication was 13.7% (7/51), with five cases of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (OFNH). Hip replacements were performed in four (7.8%) cases. After confirmation of normal transfusion status, 11 patients underwent elective removal of the implant without further complications. CONCLUSION: Closed reduction and internal fixation using PCCP in FNFs resulted in satisfactory outcomes with low complication rates. Longer follow-up (3-5 years) and sequential bone scintigraphy or SPECT after surgery are recommended after internal fixation using PCCP.",

        "abstract": "The increase in follicular atresia and the decrease in the fecundity of laying hens occur with the aging process. Therefore, the key measure for maintaining high laying performance is to alleviate follicular atresia in the aging poultry. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as an important pituitary hormone to promote follicle development and maturation, plays an important role in preventing reproductive aging in diverse animals. In this study, the physiological state of the prehierarchical small white follicles (SWFs) and atretic SWFs (ASWFs) were compared, followed by an exploration of the possible capacity of FSH to delay ASWFs' progression in the hens. The results showed that the DNA damage within follicles increased with aging, along with Golgi complex disintegration, cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis and autophagy in the ASWFs. Subsequently, the ACNU-induced follicular atresia model was established to evaluate the enhancing capacity of FSH on increasing cell proliferation and attenuating apoptosis in ASWFs. FSH inhibited DNA damage and promoted DNA repair by regulating the CHK2/p53 pathway. Furthermore, FSH inhibited CHK2/p53, thus, suppressing the disintegration of the Golgi complex, cell cycle arrest, and increased autophagy in the atretic follicles. Moreover, these effects from FSH treatment in ACNU-induced granulosa cells were similar to the treatment by a DNA repair agent AV-153. These results indicate that FSH protects aging-resulted DNA damage in granulosa cells by inhibiting CHK2/p53 in chicken prehierarchical follicles.",

METHODS: The PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central databases were used to search keywords and a total of 18 studies were included. Random and fixed effect models were used for the meta-analysis of pooled mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of 5,222 patients were identified with a mean age of 64.4 +/- 9.4 and 63 +/- 8.6 years for the cemented and cementless TKA groups, respectively. The mean follow-up was 107.9 +/- 30 and 104.3 +/- 10 months for the cemented and cementless TKA groups, respectively. Cemented TKA showed a significantly greater postoperative Knee Society Score (MD = -0.95, 95% CI [-1.57, 0.33], P = .003) and range of motion (MD = -1.09, 95% CI [-1.88, -0.29], P = .0007), but no differences in other outcome scores were found. The incidence of periprosthetic joint infection, radiolucent lines, instability, and polyethylene wear was also comparable. Cemented TKA showed less perioperative blood loss (SMD = -438.41, 95% CI [-541.69, -35.14], P < .0001) but a higher rate of manipulation under anesthesia (OR = 3.39, 95% CI [1.64, 6.99], P = .001) and aseptic loosening (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.09, 2.41], P = .02) than cementless TKA. No differences were found in terms of the reoperation rate. CONCLUSION: When cemented and cementless fixations are compared in primary TKA, comparable functional outcomes and reoperation rates can be achieved. Cemented TKA showed less blood loss but a higher rate of manipulation under anesthesia and aseptic loosening.",

Here we combined a modeling framework with the assembled contemporary records of ASF cases and multiple covariates to predict the risk distribution of ASF at a global scale. Local spatial variations in ASF risk derived from domestic pigs is influenced strongly by livestock factors, while the risk of having ASF in wild boars is mainly associated with natural habitat covariates. The risk maps show that ASF is to be ubiquitous in many areas, with a higher risk in areas in the northern hemisphere. Nearly half of the world's domestic pigs (1.388 billion) are in the high-risk zones. Our results provide a better understanding of the potential distribution beyond the current geographical scope of the disease.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: The objective of the study was to conduct a systematic review to describe and compare the different approaches for performing cardiac electrophysiology (EP) procedures in patients with interrupted inferior vena cava (IVC) or equivalent entities causing IVC obstruction. METHODS: We conducted a structured search to identify manuscripts reporting EP procedures with interrupted IVC or IVC obstruction of any aetiology published up until August 2020. No restrictions were applied in the search strategy. We also included seven local cases that met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The analysis included 142 patients (mean age 48.9 years; 48% female) undergoing 143 procedures. Obstruction of the IVC was not known before the index procedure in 54% of patients. Congenital interruption of IVC was the most frequent cause (80%); and, associated congenital heart disease (CHD) was observed in 43% of patients in this setting. The superior approach for ablation was the most frequently used strategy (52%), followed by inferior approach via the azygos or hemiazygos vein (24%), transhepatic approach (14%), and retroaortic approach (10%). Electroanatomical mapping (58%), use of long sheaths (41%), intracardiac echocardiography (19%), transesophageal echocardiography (15%) and remote controlled magnetic navigation (13%) were used as adjuncts to aid performance. Ablation was successful in 135 of 140 procedures in which outcomes were reported. Major complications were only reported in patients undergoing AF ablation, including two patients with pericardial effusion, one of whom required surgical repair, and another patient who died after inadvertent entry into an undiagnosed atrioesophageal fistula from a previous procedure. CONCLUSION: The superior approach is most frequent approach for performing EP procedures in the setting of obstructed IVC. Transhepatic approach is a feasible alternative, and may provide a \"familiar approach\" for transseptal access when it is required. Adjunctive use of long sheaths, intravascular echocardiography, electro-anatomical mapping and remote magnetic navigation may be helpful, especially if there is associated complex CHD. With careful planning, EP procedures can usually be successfully performed with a low risk of complications.",

ACS-NSQIP score has been introduced in clinical practice for few years. This study was done to find out whether there is any difference between predicted mortality from ACS-NSQIP score and observed mortality in Saudi population. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at Security Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We included patients undergoing elective and emergency surgical procedures in our hospital. Thirty days mortality data was collected and then observed to expected (O/E) mortality ratio was calculated. The sample size for our study was nine hundred and three (903) patients. RESULTS: The mean ACS-NSQIP mortality risk score (%) for the study was 0.49. Expected number of mortalities was 4.42 while observed mortalities were 11, yielding an O/E ratio of 2.48 (p-value 0.000). We did not find a significant difference between expected and observed mortalities except for ASA class 3 and 4 patients where expected numbers of mortalities were lower than observed (p-value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACS-NSQIP can be reliably used for postoperative mortality prediction especially in lower risk groups.",

To verify the validity of models, our DW and environmental factors were applied to investigate of occurrence of DW and number of DW to establish the generalized linear (logistic and Poisson) models, geographically weighted regression (GWLR and GWPR) models and GNNWR (GNNWLR and GNNWPR) models. The results show that the GNNWR models show great advantages in the model-fitting performance, prediction performance, and the spatial Moran's I of model residuals. In addition, GNNWR models can combine the geographic information system technology for accurately expressing the spatial distribution of DW relevant information to provide the key technology that can be used as the basis for human decision-making and management planning.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence that disease progression, drug response and overall clinical outcomes of CML disease are not only decided by BCR/ABL1 oncoprotein but depend on accumulation of additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations. DNA hydroxymethylation is implicated in the development of variety of diseases. DNA hydroxymethylation in gene promoters plays important roles in disease progression, drug response and clinical outcome of various diseases. Therefore in this study, we aimed to explore the role of aberrant hydroxymethylation in promoter regions of different tumor suppressor genes in relation to CML disease progression, response to imatinib therapy and clinical outcome. METHODS: We recruited 150 CML patients at different clinical stages of the disease. Patients were followed up for 48 months and haematological/molecular responses were analysed. Haematological response was analysed by peripheral blood smear. BCR/ABL1 specific TaqMan probe based qRT-PCR was used for assessing the molecular response of CML patients on imatinib therapy. Promoter hydroxymethylation of the genes was characterized using MS-PCR. RESULTS: We observed that promoter hydroxymethylation of DAPK1, RIZ1, P16INK4A, RASSF1A and p14ARF(ARF) genes characterize advanced CML disease and poor imatinib respondents. Although, cytokine signalling (SOCS1) gene was hypermethylated in advanced stages of CML and accumulated in patients with poor imatinib response, but the differences were not statistically significant. Moreover, we found hypermethylation of p14(ARF), RASSF1 and p16(INK4A) genes and cytokine signalling gene (SOCS1) significantly associated with poor overall survival of CML patients on imatinib therapy. The results of this study are in agreement of the role of aberrant DNA methylation of different tumor suppressor genes as potential biomarkers of CML disease progression, poor imatinib response and overall clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report that promoter hydroxymethylation of DAPK1, RIZ1, P16INK4A, RASSF1A and p14ARF(ARF) genes is a characteristic feature of CML disease progressions, defines poor imatinib respondents and poor overall survival of CML patients to imatinib therapy.",

We highlight the advantages of such a collider over proposed alternatives. We show how one can leverage both the point-like nature of the muons themselves as well as the cloud of electroweak radiation that surrounds the beam to blur the dichotomy between energy and precision in the search for new physics. The physics case is buttressed by a range of studies with applications to electroweak symmetry breaking, dark matter, and the naturalness of the weak scale. Furthermore, we make sharp connections with complementary experiments that are probing new physics effects using electric dipole moments, flavor violation, and gravitational waves. An extensive appendix provides cross section predictions as a function of the center-of-mass energy for many canonical simplified models.",

Burn and ICU admission and antibiotics exposures facilitate CRE acquisition. Escherichia coli ST167 was the dominant CRE clone. BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) across South Asian (SA) hospitals, we documented the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections at Dhaka Medical College Hospital between October 2016 and September 2017. METHODS: We enrolled patients and collected epidemiology and outcome data. All Enterobacterales were characterized phenotypically and by whole-genome sequencing. Risk assessment for the patients with CRE was performed compared with patients with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacterales (CSE). RESULTS: 10.6% of all 1831 patients with a clinical specimen collected had CRE. In-hospital 30-day mortality was significantly higher with CRE [50/180 (27.8%)] than CSE [42/312 (13.5%)] (P = .001); however, for bloodstream infections, this was nonsignificant. Of 643 Enterobacterales isolated, 210 were CRE; blaNDM was present in 180 isolates, blaOXA-232 in 26, blaOXA-181 in 24, and blaKPC-2 in 5. Despite this, ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed empirical antibiotic and only 27% of patients were prescribed at least 1 antibiotic to which their infecting pathogen was susceptible. Significant risk factors for CRE isolation included burns unit and intensive care unit admission, and prior exposure to levofloxacin, amikacin, clindamycin, and meropenem. Escherichia coli ST167 was the dominant CRE clone. Clustering suggested clonal transmission of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 and the MDR hypervirulent clone, ST23. The major trajectories involved in horizontal gene transfer were IncFII and IncX3, IS26, and Tn3. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study from an SA public hospital combining outcome, microbiology, and genomics. The findings indicate the urgent implementation of targeted diagnostics, appropriate antibiotic use, and infection-control interventions in SA public institutions.",

        "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large elaborate structure embedded within the nuclear envelope, and intimately linked to the cytoskeleton, nucleoskeleton, and chromatin. Many different cargoes pass through its central channel and along the membrane at its periphery. The NPC is dismantled and reassembly, fully or partially, every cell cycle. In post-mitotic cells it consists of a combination of hyper-stable and highly dynamic proteins. Because of its size, dynamics, heterogeneity and integration, it is not possible to understand its structure and molecular function by any one, or even several, methods. For decades, and to this day, thin section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been a central tool for understanding the NPC, its associations, dynamics and role in transport as it can uniquely answer questions concerning fine structural detail within a cellular context. Using immunogold labeling specific components can also be identified within the ultrastructural context. Model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae are also central to NPC studies but have not been used extensively in structural work. This is because the cell wall presents difficulties with structural preservation and processing for TEM. In recent years, high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution have overcome these problems, as well as opened up methods to combine immunogold labeling with detailed structural analysis. Other model organisms such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been underused for similar reasons, but with similar solutions, which we present here. There are also many advantages to using these methods, adapted for use in mammalian systems, due to the instant nature of the initial fixation, to capture rapid processes such as nuclear transport, and preservation of dynamic membranes.",

        "abstract": "While chemical fertilisers and pesticides indeed enhance agricultural productivity, their excessive usage has been detrimental to environmental health. In addressing this matter, the use of environmental microbiomes has been greatly favoured as a 'greener' alternative to these inorganic chemicals' application. Challenged by a significant proportion of unidentified microbiomes with unknown ecological functions, advanced high throughput metatranscriptomics is prudent to overcome the technological limitations in unfolding the previously undiscovered functional profiles of the beneficial microbiomes. Under this context, this review begins by summarising (1) the evolution of next-generation sequencing and metatranscriptomics in leveraging the microbiome transcriptome profiles through whole gene expression profiling. Next, the current environmental metatranscriptomics studies are reviewed, with the discussion centred on (2) the emerging application of the beneficial microbiomes in developing fertile soils and (3) the development of disease-suppressive soils as greener alternatives against biotic stress. As sustainable agriculture focuses not only on crop productivity but also long-term environmental sustainability, the second half of the review highlights the metatranscriptomics' contribution in (4) revolutionising the pollution monitoring systems via specific bioindicators. Overall, growing knowledge on the complex microbiome functional profiles is imperative to unlock the unlimited potential of agricultural microbiome-based practices, which we believe hold the key to productive agriculture and sustainable environment.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: A wire composite splint (WCS) is most commonly used in clinical practice for the management of luxation dental injuries (LDIs). Wire thickness and adhesive point dimensions influence the rigidity of WCS. However, the influence of presplint tooth mobility on the rigidity of splint is not yet addressed. AIM: The aim of this study is to identify the optimal thickness of WCS that achieves physiologic mobility in teeth with varying degrees of loosening (DoL) in a simulated LDI model. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In vitro study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three typodont models with resin teeth were used. Right central incisor (Tooth 11) was simulated as an injured tooth and adjacent right lateral and left central incisor teeth (12 and21) acted as uninjured teeth. Each typodont model was modified to reproduce DoL 1, 2, and 3 in tooth 11 and categorized as Groups I, II, and III, respectively. The simulated injured tooth 11 was splinted with adjacent teeth 12 and 21 using 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 mm WCS. Postsplinting DoL was assessed with Periotest. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Two-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey test were used for intragroup and intergroup comparisons of pre- and postsplinting Periotest values (PTVs). Friedman's two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for the intragroup and intergroup comparison of splint effect. RESULTS: Irrespective of the thickness of WCS, the postsplint PTVs corresponding to DoL 0 for simulated injured right central incisor tooth (11) were not achieved in Groups II and III. In three study groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the splint effect produced by 0.3 mm versus 0.5 mm WCS or 0.5 mm versus 0.8 mm WCS for tooth 11. CONCLUSIONS: The postsplint DoL for a luxated tooth is affected by both the degree of presplint tooth mobility and the thickness of the wire.",

        "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene fusions represent an extremely rare aberration, occurring in approximately 0.05-0.13% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RAD51 is the most frequently involved partner gene in EGFR fusions, but other fusion partner genes have been described. To date, a considerable number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels still cannot detect these alterations due to the position of the breakpoint site, mainly involving intron 24 of EGFR. Current evidences show that such gene alteration is more likely to occur in lung adenocarcinomas of young, female, non-smoker patients. Also, brain metastases are frequently reported in these patients. Only very few cases in literature described clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients harboring EGFR gene fusions, reporting responses to 1st generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Herein, we report the case of two young non-smoker females with metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR-RAD51 gene fusion, detected by FoundationOne DX1 assay, who responded to EGFR TKIs. The first patient initially received erlotinib, then switched to osimertinib for renal toxicity, while the second was treated with gefitinib. This is, to our knowledge, the first report describing response to the 3rd EGFR TKI osimertinib. Our experience highlights the need of a broader molecular profiling in young or never smoker NSCLC patients without detectable molecular aberration using standard NGS panels. Finally, further studies to assess the real prevalence of EGFR gene fusions and their spectrum of sensitivity to different EGFR TKIs are needed.",

METHODS: From October 2018 to April 2020, patients were retrospectively reviewed and divided into breast cancer non-NAC and NAC groups. The prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis was evaluated through quantitative MRI mDIXON-Quant examinations by using defined proton density fat fraction cutoffs of liver fat. The EAT volume was quantified on chest CT by semi-automatic volume analysis software. Bootstrap analysis was used in the breast cancer NAC group to test the significance of the mediating effect of liver fat content on EAT volume. RESULTS: A total of 662 breast cancer patients (non-NAC group: 445 patients; NAC group: 217 patients) were included. The prevalence of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis in the NAC group was significantly higher than the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in the non-NAC group (42.8% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.001). EAT volume was measured in 561 of 662 breast cancer patients, and was significantly higher in the NAC group than in the non-NAC group (137.26 +/- 53.48 mL vs. 125.14 +/- 58.77 mL, p = 0.020). In the breast cancer NAC group, the indirect effect of liver fat content on EAT volume was 2.545 (p < 0.001), and the contribution rate to the effect was 69.1%. CONCLUSIONS: EAT volume was significantly higher in the BC-NAC group than in the BC-non-NAC group. KEY POINTS: * The prevalence of CASH was as high as 42.8% in BC patients. * NAC significantly increased the EAT volume in BC patients. * The liver fat content caused the change of EAT volume through mediating effect.",

Thus, we aimed to investigate the patterns of change in dynamic FC in depressed adolescents. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 60 first-episode, drug-naive adolescents with MDD and 60 matched healthy controls (HCs). Then, the dynamic FC properties were analyzed using a sliding windows approach, k-means clustering, and graph theory methods. The intrinsic brain FC were clustered into two configuration states-a more frequent and relatively sparsely connected State 1 and a less frequent and more strongly interconnected State 2. Compared with HCs, depressed adolescents had higher reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 1, and lower reoccurrence fraction and dwell time in State 2, and higher total number of transitions between the two states. Depressed adolescents showed decreased FC within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other networks in State 1. Additionally, the MDD group showed higher variances in the global and local efficiency. Furthermore, the duration of illness was positively correlated with the number of state transitions, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was positively correlated with the mean dwell time in State 1. This study demonstrated abnormal dynamic FC in depressed adolescents, which provided new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent-onset depression.",

Oral manifestations of systemic sclerosis may include limited ability to open the mouth, xerostomia, periodontal disease, enlarged periodontal ligament, and bone resorption of the jaw. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 54-year-old Caucasian patient presented with oral pain, swallowing, phonation and chewing difficulties associated with dental instability, hygiene/handling difficulties and her main problem with microstomia, which prevented her from removing the skeletal prosthesis for 4 years, depriving her of social life. Gradual treatment with dental implants was diagnosed and planned to support a fixed total denture adapted to the ridge with self-cleaning characteristics. After implant insertion, panoramic radiographs with standardized parameters were taken to compare crestal bone levels at the time of prosthesis placement and with 10 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The average crestal bone loss of the 12 implants after the 10 years of follow-up was 1.26 mm for the maxilla and 1.17 mm for the mandible. The survival of the 12 support implants of two total fixed prostheses in a clinical/radiographic follow-up of 10 years was 100%. After 10 years of follow-up, the 12 implants inserted had a bone loss similar to that of healthy patients and no pathologies were registered, recovering function, aesthetics, and self-esteem. This therapy must be implemented before the interincisal distance decreases to 30 mm to allow intraoral surgical/prosthetic access. Implant-supported total fixed rehabilitation is a viable, predictable, and recommended therapy in patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Although the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been the most widely adopted temporary mechanical support device in cardiac surgical patients, its use has declined. The current study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and predictors of early mortality and complication rates in contemporary cardiac surgery patients supported by an IABP. METHODS: A multicentre, retrospective analysis was performed of all consecutive cardiac surgical patients receiving perioperative balloon pump support in 8 centres between January 2010 to December 2019. The primary outcome was early mortality, and secondary outcomes were balloon-associated complications. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was applied to evaluate predictors of the primary outcome. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 2615 consecutive patients. The median age was 68 years [25th percentile 61, 75th percentile 75 years], with the majority being male (76.9%), and a mean calculated 30-day mortality risk of 10.0%. Early mortality was 12.7% (n = 333), due to cardiac causes (n = 266), neurological causes (=22), balloon-related causes (n = 5) and other causes (n = 40). A composite end point of all vascular complications occurred in 7.2% of patients, and leg ischaemia was observed in 1.3% of patients. The most important predictors of early mortality were peripheral vascular disease [odds ratio (OR) 1.63], postoperative dialysis requirement (OR 10.40) and vascular complications (OR 2.57). CONCLUSIONS: The use of the perioperative IABP proved to be safe and demonstrated relatively low complication rates, particularly for leg ischaemia. As such, we believe that specialists should not be held back to use this widely available treatment in high-risk cardiac surgical patients when indicated.",

        "abstract": "AIM AND BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence supports the impact of intermittent fasting (IF) on normalizing body weight and that the interaction between body genes and environmental factors shapes human susceptibility to developing obesity. FTO gene is one of these genes with metabolic effects related to energy metabolism and body fat deposition. This research examined the changes in FTO gene expression upon Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) in a group of metabolically healthy subjects with overweight and obesity. METHODS: Sixty-three (63) subjects were recruited, of which 57 (17 males and 40 females, mean age 38.4 +/- 11.2 years) subjects with overweight and obesity (BMI = 29.89 +/- 5.02 kg/m(2)were recruited and monitored before and at the end of Ramadan month), and 6 healthy subjects with normal BMI (21.4 +/- 2.20 kg/m(2)) recruited only to standardize the reference for normal levels of FTO gene expression. In the two-time points, anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary assessments were undertaken, and FTO gene expression tests were performed using RNA extracted from the whole blood sample. RESULTS: In contrast to normal BMI subjects, the relative gene expressions in overweight/obese were significantly decreased at the end of Ramadan (-32.30%, 95% CI-0.052 -0.981) in comparison with the pre-fasting state. Significant reductions were found in body weight, BMI, fat mass, body fat percent, hip circumference, LDL, IL-6, TNF-alpha (P<0.001), and in waist circumference (P<0.05), whilst HDL and IL-10 significantly increased (P<0.001) at the end of Ramadan in comparison with the pre-fasting levels. Binary logistic regression analysis for genetic expressions showed no significant association between high-energy intake, waist circumference, or obesity and FTO gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: RIF is associated with the downregulation of the FTO gene expression in subjects with obesity, and this may explain, at least in part, its favorable metabolic effects. Hence, RIF presumably may entail a protective impact against body weight gain and its adverse metabolic-related derangements in subjects with obesity.",

        "abstract": "Although reducing psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia has been a major focus of therapeutic interventions for decades, improving cognition is considered a better predictor of functional outcomes. However, the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs (APDs) show only marginal beneficial effects on cognition in patients with schizophrenia. The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia remain unknown that making drug development efforts very challenging. Since neurotrophic factors are the primary architects of neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, the findings from preclinical and clinical studies that assess changes in neurogenesis and neurotrophic factors and their relationship to cognitive performance in schizophrenia, and how these mechanisms might be impacted by APD treatment, may provide valuable clues in developing therapies to combat cognitive deficit in schizophrenia. Numerous evidence produced over the years suggests a deficit in a wide spectrum of neurotrophic factors in schizophrenia. Since schizophrenia is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, early intervention with neurotrophic factors may be more effective in ameliorating the cognitive deficits and psychopathological symptoms associated with this pathology. In this context, results from initial clinical trials with neurotrophic factors and their future potential to improve cognition and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia are discussed.",

Quantitative flow ratio (QFR(R)) is an angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) that does not require a pressure wire or pharmacological hyperemia. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of QFR-based patient information in Heart Teams' discussions to determine the optimal revascularization strategy for patients with MVD. We hypothesized that there is an acceptable agreement between treatment recommendations based on the QFR approach and recommendation based on the FFR approach. The DECISION QFR study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial that will include patients with MVD who require revascularization. Two Heart Teams comprising cardiologists and cardiac surgeons will be randomized to select a revascularization strategy (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft) according to patient information either based on QFR or on FFR. All 260 patients will be assessed by both teams with reference to the anatomical and functional SYNTAX score/SYNTAX score II 2020 derived from the allocated physiological index (QFR or FFR). The primary endpoint of the trial is the level of agreement between the treatment recommendations of both teams, assessed using Cohen's kappa. As of March 2022, the patient enrollment has been completed and 230 patients have been discussed in both Heart Teams. The current trial will indicate the usefulness of QFR, which enables a wireless multivessel physiological interrogation, in the discussions of Heart Teams to determine the optimal revascularization strategy for MVD.",

        "abstract": "Intraneuronal accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, mechanisms capable of promoting alpha-synuclein deposition bear important pathogenetic implications. Mutations of the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) gene represent a prevalent Parkinson's disease risk factor. They are associated with loss of activity of a key enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, glucocerebrosidase, supporting a mechanistic relationship between abnormal alpha-synuclein-lipid interactions and the development of Parkinson pathology. In this study, the lipid membrane composition of fibroblasts isolated from control subjects, patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease patients carrying the L444P GBA mutation (PD-GBA) was assayed using shotgun lipidomics. The lipid profile of PD-GBA fibroblasts differed significantly from that of control and idiopathic Parkinson's disease cells. It was characterized by an overall increase in sphingolipid levels. It also featured a significant increase in the proportion of ceramide, sphingomyelin and hexosylceramide molecules with shorter chain length and a decrease in the percentage of longer-chain sphingolipids. The extent of this shift was correlated to the degree of reduction of fibroblast glucocerebrosidase activity. Lipid extracts from control and PD-GBA fibroblasts were added to recombinant alpha-synuclein solutions. The kinetics of alpha-synuclein aggregation were significantly accelerated after addition of PD-GBA extracts as compared to control samples. Amyloid fibrils collected at the end of these incubations contained lipids, indicating alpha-synuclein-lipid co-assembly. Lipids extracted from alpha-synuclein fibrils were also analysed by shotgun lipidomics. Data revealed that the lipid content of these fibrils was significantly enriched by shorter-chain sphingolipids. In a final set of experiments, control and PD-GBA fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of the small molecule chaperone ambroxol. This treatment restored glucocerebrosidase activity and sphingolipid levels and composition of PD-GBA cells. It also reversed the pro-aggregation effect that lipid extracts from PD-GBA fibroblasts had on alpha-synuclein. Taken together, the findings of this study indicate that the L444P GBA mutation and consequent enzymatic loss are associated with a distinctly altered membrane lipid profile that provides a biological fingerprint of this mutation in Parkinson fibroblasts. This altered lipid profile could also be an indicator of increased risk for alpha-synuclein aggregate pathology.",

METHOD: Three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, and Ovid-Embase were searched. The studies were retrieved from inception to October 2021. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the methodological quality based on the inclusion criteria. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-two studies were incorporated into the final analyses. Exosomes derived from stem cells could not only significantly improve the motor function of animals with SCI, but also significantly increase the expression of anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10 and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, while significantly lowering the pro-inflammatory factor IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and the expression of the apoptotic protein BAX. However, the mechanism of exosome-mediated SCI repair, as well as the best source and dosage remain unknown. In addition, there are still some issues with the design, implementation, and reporting of animal experiments in the included studies. Therefore, future research should further standardize the implementation and reporting of animal studies and fully explore the best strategies for exosomes to repair SCI so as to promote the translation of preclinical research results to clinical research better and faster.",

Following MI injury, 2-HOBA treated mice displayed decreased infarction area and improved heart function compared with the saline-treated group. Moreover, 2-HOBA effectively attenuated MI-induced cardiac remodeling, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. 4-hydroxybenzylamine (4-HOBA), a less reactive isomer of 2-HOBA, barely antagonized the MI-induced injury.

These knowledge gaps limit the uptake of reperfusion therapies and reduce the efficiency of pediatric acute stroke pathways. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and natural history of pediatric LVO stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2019, with a mean (SD) follow-up of 37.0 (28.8) months. Admissions from all pediatric hospitals in the state of New South Wales, Australia, with a final diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients 1 month to younger than 17 years were included. A total of 85 of 251 identified cases were excluded based on selection criteria. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to June 2021. EXPOSURES: One-third of patients with LVO received mechanical thrombectomy with or without intravenous thrombolysis while the remainder were treated conservatively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pediatric modified Rankin Scale (ped-mRS) score 3 months after stroke. Ordinal logistic regression was used to compare non-LVO, LVO without thrombectomy, and LVO with thrombectomy groups. RESULTS: Of 161 included patients, 56 (34.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 6.1 (5.4) years. A total of 166 AIS admissions were studied, and clinical follow-up was available for 164 of 166 admissions. LVO was present in 39 admissions (23.5%). The incidence of LVO stroke was 0.24 per 100\u202f000 patients per year (95% CI, 0.13-0.35). Patients with LVO who did not receive thrombectomy (n = 26) had poor neurological outcomes, with 19 (73.1%) experiencing moderate to severe disability or death (ped-mRS score of 3 to 6) at 3 months (6 of 12 patients receiving thrombectomy [50.0%]; 25 of 38 patients with LVO [65.8%]). Patients with LVO without thrombectomy had significantly worse clinical outcomes than patients with non-LVO at 3 months (odds ratio, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.68-7.87; P = .001). Most patients with LVO presented within time windows suitable for thrombectomy (27 of 39 [69.2%] within 6 hours; 35 of 39 [89.7%] within 24 hours). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this population-based cohort study, the natural history of pediatric patients with LVO stroke treated conservatively was poor, with most experiencing lifelong disability or death. Nearly 90% of pediatric patients with LVO presented within time windows suitable for thrombectomy.",

Thus, this study examined whether objective/subjective ES was associated with happiness in older adults in two Myanmar regions. A multistage random sampling procedure and face-to-face interviews were conducted in the urban and rural areas of Myanmar. The happiness of 1200 participants aged >60 years was evaluated using a single happiness score ranging from 0 (very unhappy) to 10 (very happy). The wealth index, used as an objective ES, was calculated from 17 household asset items, such as radio, washing machines, and television. Subjective ES was assessed by asking \"Which of the following best describes your current financial situation in light of general economic conditions?\" Responses ranged from \"very difficult\" to \"very comfortable\". Both low objective and subjective ES were negatively associated with happiness, after adjusting for confounding variables and stratification by region (urban and rural areas). Although objective and subjective ES had similar associations with happiness in urban areas, subjective ES had a stronger association in rural areas.",

In 3D bioprinting, which is a step ahead of 3D biomaterial printing, the ink employed is impregnated with cells, without compromising ink printability. This allows for immediate scaffold cellularization and generation of complex structures. The use of cell-laden inks or bio-inks provides the opportunity for enhanced cell differentiation for organ fabrication and regeneration. Recognizing the importance of such bio-inks, the current study comprehensively explores the state of the art of the utilization of bio-inks based on natural polymers (biopolymers), such as cellulose, agarose, alginate, decellularized matrix, in 3D bioprinting. Discussions regarding progress in bioprinting, techniques and approaches employed in the bioprinting of natural polymers, and limitations and prospects concerning future trends in human-scale tissue and organ fabrication are also presented.",

AIM: To identify the prognostic value of NLR, PLR, LMR and GPS in osteosarcoma patients through reviewing relevant studies. METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI databases were searched up to October 2, 2021. The primary and second outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to assess the association between these indicators and prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies involving 2087 patients were eventually included. The pooled results demonstrated that higher NLR and GPS were significantly associated with poorer OS (HR = 1.88, 95%CI: 1.38-2.55, P < 0.001; HR = 2.19, 95%CI: 1.64-2.94, P < 0.001) and DFS (HR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.37-2.04, P < 0.001; HR = 2.50, 95%CI: 1.39-4.48, P < 0.001). However, no significant relationship of PLR and LMR and OS (P = 0.085; P = 0.338) and DFS (P = 0.396; P = 0.124) was observed. CONCLUSION: Higher NLR and GPS were related with worse prognosis and might serve as novel prognostic indicators for osteosarcoma patients.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to generate normative values for motor and sensory ulnar nerve conduction studies (NCSs) in Nigerian population and to determine the influence of gender and height on ulnar nerve conduction velocity (NCV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 200 healthy volunteers were selected after clinical evaluation to exclude common causes of ulnar neuropathy. We carried out NCS of ulnar nerves on all the healthy volunteers according to a standardized protocol. The NCS parameters included in the final analysis were amplitude, latency, NCV, and f-wave latency. Ethical approval was obtained for the study. RESULTS: The mean ulnar nerve sensory velocity was 55.22 +/- 5.67 with 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of 46.9 and 70.1, respectively. The mean latency of the ulnar nerve (sensory) was 2.97 +/- 0.62 with 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of 2.00 and 4.52, respectively. The mean amplitude of the ulnar nerve (sensory) was 35.56 +/- 9.97 with 2.5 and 97.5 percentile of 15.9 and 57.7, respectively). The ulnar NCV was significantly (P = 0.0202) higher in male. Mild inverse correlation (r = 0.2) was found between ulnar NCV and height of the participants (P = 0.0089). CONCLUSION: In the Nigerian population, normative values of motor and sensory ulnar nerve conduction parameters are similar to the existing values in the literature. The ulnar NCV appeared to be influenced by height and gender.",

Operative time was longer for the RAL group (P < .001) with a mean time of 202 minutes (RAL), 182 minutes (OS), 173 minutes (SL), and 157 minutes (HAL). Complications (P = .002) and consumption of morphine derivates (P = .31) were lower for the RAL group (P = .0002). The visual analog scale pain scores (P = .002), hospital stay (P = .023), and time to return to full activities (P = .79) were higher for OS.

In Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models, within-person results do not reveal prospective lag-1 effects of either ER or symptoms. However, between-person analyses showed that dispositional ER ability at baseline predicted greater risk for developing clinically significant depression, anxiety, and substance dependence over the 7-year follow-up period. These findings provide some of the first direct evidence of prospective effects of ER on future symptom risk across affect-related disorders, and should strengthen existing claims that ER ability represents a key transdiagnostic risk factor.",

Analysis of public drug sensitivity data showed neuroblastoma lines to be sensitive to indisulam, a molecular glue that selectively targets RNA splicing factor RBM39 for proteosomal degradation via DCAF15-E3-ubiquitin ligase. In neuroblastoma models, indisulam induces rapid loss of RBM39, accumulation of splicing errors and growth inhibition in a DCAF15-dependent manner. Integrative analysis of RNAseq and proteomics data highlight a distinct disruption to cell cycle and metabolism. Metabolic profiling demonstrates metabolome perturbations and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from indisulam. Complete tumour regression without relapse was observed in both xenograft and the Th-MYCN transgenic model of neuroblastoma after indisulam treatment, with RBM39 loss, RNA splicing and metabolic changes confirmed in vivo. Our data show that dual-targeting of metabolism and RNA splicing with anticancer indisulam is a promising therapeutic approach for high-risk neuroblastoma.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, women, while having a longer life expectancy than men, experience a differential risk for chronic diseases and have unique nutritional needs based on physiological and hormonal changes across the life span. However, much of what is known about health is based on research conducted in men. Additional complexity in assessing nutritional needs within gender include the variations in genetics, body compositions, hormonal milieus, underlying chronic diseases, and medication usage, with this list expanding as we consider these variables across the life course. It is clear women experience nutrient shortfalls during key periods of their lives, which may differentially impact their health. Consequently, as we move into the era of precision nutrition, understanding these sex- and gender-based differences may help optimize recommendations and interventions chosen to support health and weight management. Recently, a scientific conference was convened with content experts to explore these topics from a life-course perspective at biological, physiological, and behavioral levels. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop and provides an overview of important nutrition and related lifestyle considerations across the life course. The landscape of addressing female-specific nutritional needs continues to grow; now more than ever, it is essential to increase our understanding of the physiological differences between men and women, and determine how these physiological considerations may aid in optimizing nutritional strategies to support certain personal goals related to health, quality of life, sleep, and exercise performance among women.",

        "abstract": "Although hard rigid rods (k-mers) defined on the square lattice have been widely studied in the literature, their entropy per site, s(k), in the full-packing limit is only known exactly for dimers (k=2) and numerically for trimers (k=3). Here, we investigate this entropy for rods with k</=7, by defining and solving them on Husimi lattices built with diagonal and regular square-lattice clusters of effective lateral size L, where L defines the level of approximation to the square lattice. Due to an L-parity effect, by increasing L we obtain two systematic sequences of values for the entropies s_L(k) for each type of cluster, whose extrapolations to L-->infinity provide estimates of these entropies for the square lattice. For dimers, our estimates for s(2) differ from the exact result by only 0.03%, while that for s(3) differs from best available estimates by 3%. In this paper, we also obtain a new estimate for s(4). For larger k, we find that the extrapolated results from the Husimi tree calculations do not lie between the lower and upper bounds established in the literature for s(k). In fact, we observe that, to obtain reliable estimates for these entropies, we should deal with levels L that increase with k. However, it is very challenging computationally to advance to solve the problem for large values of L and for large rods. In addition, the exact calculations on the generalized Husimi trees provide strong evidence for the fully packed phase to be disordered for k>/=4, in contrast to the results for the Bethe lattice wherein it is nematic.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) often require feeding tubes (FT) for weeks to months. Because FTs are in near constant contact with human milk and/or formula, rapid and extensive bacterial growth is possible. Due to their immature immunologic and gastrointestinal (GI) systems, infants may be at significant health risk due to FT colonization. In adults, length of time FTs remain in place (dwell time) affects the degree of colonization and biofilm formation which is important in infants whose tubes remain in place up to 30 days. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to describe and summarize the evidence regarding FT bacterial colonization in infants and identify gaps needing further investigation. METHODS: Medline, CINAHL, and Embase databases were searched for clinical and/or laboratory-based observational and randomized controlled studies investigating the presence of bacteria in neonatal FTs. RESULTS: This review of 10 studies found evidence that neonatal FTs may contain high quantities of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria and longer dwell times may increase the bacterial load. Furthermore, evidence suggests FT colonization may be nosocomial in origin and contribute to adverse infant health. Feeding tubes are an unrecognized source of bacterial colonization which may increase morbidity in premature infants and thus the presence of bacteria in FTs is an important area of investigation in the nutritional care of vulnerable infants in the NICU. IMPLICATIONS: Further appropriately powered studies which are clinically based, use appropriate analyses, and control for potential covariates are necessary to make clinical recommendations.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the relationship between white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), nigrostriatal dopamine deficits, and cognitive decline in patients with drug-naive early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). METHOD: This cross-sectional study enrolled 309 non-demented patients with de novo PD who underwent [(18)F] N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbonethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane positron emission tomography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and a detailed neuropsychological test at baseline. We quantified dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in each striatal sub-region and applied the Scheltens scale to assess the severity of periventricular and deep WMHs. The relationships between WMHs, DAT availability, and cognition in PD were assessed using multivariate linear regression and mediation analyses while adjusting for age at parkinsonian symptom onset, sex, disease duration, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: The severities of periventricular and frontal WMHs were associated with striatal DAT availability. Periventricular WMHs affected the level of cognitive performance in all cognitive domains, while frontal WMHs affected the attention/working memory and frontal/executive function domains. The effects of WMHs on attention/working memory and frontal/executive dysfunction were mostly direct with minimal mediating effects through striatal DAT availability. Meanwhile, striatal DAT availability fully mediated the association between WMHs and cognitive impairment in the visuospatial and memory function domains. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the different effects of WMHs on cognitive impairment depending on the cognitive domains in PD. These findings suggest a close link between comorbid WMHs, striatal dopamine depletion, and cognition in patients with PD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient participation in decision making is a basic tenet for a patient centred care experience and, has potential to improve care experiences and responsiveness in chronic diseases such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM). However, documented experiences show that patient participation in decisions making is wanting. As Malawi strives to institutionalise patient centred care delivery, it is important to examine patients' experiences and perceptions to identify barriers affecting their participation in shared decision making because this may provide evidence supporting strategies in implementation of the institutionalisation. AIM: The study sought to describe perspectives about barriers to participation in shared decision making among patients with DM in Malawi. METHODS: This was an exploratory qualitative study. We targeted patients attending DM clinics in four public health facilities in southern Malawi from September to December 2019. We used In-Depth Interviews and Focus Group Discussions. Data was managed using Nvivo version 11 software and analysed using Content Analysis. RESULTS: The study highlights the values, perceptions and benefits of shared decision making. Furthermore, patients' narratives expose the struggles and vulnerabilities in their attempts to engage their providers towards shared decision making. CONCLUSION: Interactional power imbalances, insufficient dialogue and patients' own restrictive attitudes towards engagement with their providers thwarts SDM in clinical encounters. To make SDM a reality, transforming medical education that emphasizes on the value of good patient-provider relationship and providers' attitudes to regard patients as active partners may be a good starting point. Additionally, strategies that empower and change patients' perceptions about SDM require investment.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) associates with atherosclerotic diseases such as stroke. However, previous results on the association between hsCRP levels and functional disability were controversial. METHODS: We analyzed 2,610 men and women who did not exhibit functional disability or death within the first 3 years of the baseline survey and those aged 65 years or older at the end of follow-up. The levels of hsCRP were assessed using latex agglutination assay at baseline survey from 2006 to 2014. Functional disability was followed up using the long-term care insurance (LTCI) program until November 1, 2019. Functional disability was defined as a new LTCI program certification. Cox proportional hazards model with competing risk analysis for death was used to evaluate the association between hsCRP levels and future functional disability. RESULTS: During a 9-year follow-up period, we observed 328 cases of functional disability and 67 deaths without prior functional disability incidence. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR, 95% confidence interval [CI]) of functional disability in log-transferred hsCRP levels was 1.43 (1.22-1.67) in men and 0.97 (0.81-1.15) in women. When hsCRP level was analyzed as a categorical variable, low hsCRP levels (\uff1c1.0 mg/l) as the reference, the multivariable-adjusted HR (95% CI) of functional disability in high hsCRP levels (>/= 3.0 mg/l) was 2.37 (1.56-3.62). Similar results were observed when stratified by sex, but it was not significant in women. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that low-grade systemic inflammation to assess hsCRP might predict the future incidence of functional disability, especially in men.",

We developed a flexible model 'Movement-driven modelling of spatio-temporal infection risk' (MoveSTIR) that leverages diverse data on animal movement to derive metrics of direct and indirect contact by decomposing transmission into constituent processes of contact formation and duration and pathogen deposition and acquisition. We use MoveSTIR to demonstrate that ignoring fine-scale animal movements on actual landscapes can mis-characterize transmission risk and epidemiological dynamics. MoveSTIR unifies previous work on epidemiological contact networks and can address applied and theoretical questions at the nexus of movement and disease ecology.",

We performed a systematic review to characterize the clinical features of this new clinical entity. METHODS: We conducted a thorough literature search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Articles published from inception to 23 June 2021 were considered. A two-stage article selection process was performed. Articles that reported clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with spin-induced exertional rhabdomyolysis (SIER) were included. Quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. RESULTS: There were a total of 22 articles and 97 patients with SIER. Most patients were healthy females who had attended their first spinning session. The mean time to clinical presentation was 3.1 +/- 1.5 days. The most common presenting symptoms were myalgia, dark urine, and muscle weakness in the thighs. Seven patients (7.2%) developed acute kidney injury, and two patients (2.1%) required temporary inpatient hemodialysis. Four patients (4.1%) developed thigh compartment syndrome and required fasciotomies. No long-term sequelae or mortality were observed. The mean length of stay was 5.6 +/- 2.9 days. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals must have a high index of suspicion for SIER when a patient presents with myalgia, dark urine, or weakness after a recent episode of indoor spinning. Fitness center owners, spinning instructors, and participants should also be better educated about the clinical features and manifestations of SIER.",

Greater amounts of physical activity and physical fitness in children are associated with cardiovascular health benefits. We aimed to explore factors, influencing endothelial function and arterial compliance in a cohort of healthy school children. METHODS: The 94 participants (41 girls, 53 boys) in the study were young, healthy children from a German school cohort. Anthropometric data, body composition and blood pressure were assessed. Blood was drawn (8 h overnight fast), assessing total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein and triglycerides. Endothelial function was diagnosed by flow-mediated dilatation with ultrasonography (ALOKA/Hitachi, Prosound alpha 6). Tracking gates were set on the intima in B-mode. The waveform of diameter changes over the cardiac cycle was displayed in real time using the FMD-mode of the eTRACKING system. Changes in arterial diameter at baseline, ischaemia and vasodilatation were measured. A symptom limited pulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer was performed to test cardiorespiratory fitness. Physical activity was assessed using GT3x accelerometers (Actigraph, USA), over 4 days (including 1 week-end day), with a minimum wear-time duration of 10 h. RESULTS: The median age was 12.2 years (11.8-12.8). Children were normal weight, blood lipid profiles (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride) were in normal range. Baseline measurements during the diagnostics of endothelial function revealed higher arterial compliance of the brachial artery in boys. Boys' cardiorespiratory fitness was higher than compared to girls. Boys met the recommendations of 60 min moderate to vigorous activity, whereas girls were significantly less active and did not meet current recommendations. More time spent in sedentary activity was the main predictor for lower arterial compliance (adjusted for age and sex), accounting for 14% of the variance. No significant model revealed, analyzing the influencing factors such as anthropometric data, blood lipids, physical activity and fitness on endothelial function. CONCLUSION: This is the first study on endothelial function in association to objectively measured physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy school children in Germany. The study highlights the importance of reducing time spent being sedentary to maintain endothelial health.",

        "abstract": "As sessile organisms, plants must adapt to a changing environment, sensing variations in resource availability and modifying their development in response. Light is one of the most important resources for plants, and its perception by sensory photoreceptors (e.g., phytochromes) and subsequent transduction into long-term transcriptional reprogramming have been well characterized. Chromatin changes have been shown to be involved in photomorphogenesis. However, the initial short-term transcriptional changes produced by light and what factors enable these rapid changes are not well studied. Here, we define rapidly light-responsive, Phytochrome Interacting Factor (PIF) direct-target genes (LRP-DTGs). We found that a majority of these genes also show rapid changes in Histone 3 Lysine-9 acetylation (H3K9ac) in response to the light signal. Detailed time-course analysis of transcript and chromatin changes showed that, for light-repressed genes, H3K9 deacetylation parallels light-triggered transcriptional repression, while for light-induced genes, H3K9 acetylation appeared to somewhat precede light-activated transcript accumulation. However, direct, real-time imaging of transcript elongation in the nucleus revealed that, in fact, transcriptional induction actually parallels H3K9 acetylation. Collectively, the data raise the possibility that light-induced transcriptional and chromatin-remodeling processes are mechanistically intertwined. Histone modifying proteins involved in long term light responses do not seem to have a role in this fast response, indicating that different factors might act at different stages of the light response. This work not only advances our understanding of plant responses to light, but also unveils a system in which rapid chromatin changes in reaction to an external signal can be studied under natural conditions.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite substantial progress in the field, malaria remains a global health issue and currently available control strategies are not sufficient to achieve eradication. Agents able to prevent transmission are likely to have a strong impact on malaria control and have been prioritized as a primary objective to reduce the number of secondary infections. Therefore, there is an increased interest in finding novel drugs targeting sexual stages of Plasmodium and innovative methods to target malaria transmission from host to vector, and vice versa. AREAS COVERED: This review covers innovative transmission-blocking inventions patented between 2015 and October 2021. The focus is on chemical interventions, which could be used as 'chemical vaccines' to prevent transmission (small molecules, carbohydrates, and polypeptides). EXPERT OPINION: Even though the development of novel strategies to block transmission still requires fundamental additional research and a deeper understanding of parasite sexual stages biology, the research in this field has significantly accelerated. Among innovative inventions patented over the last 6 years, the surface-delivery of antimalarial drugs to kill transmission-stages parasites in mosquitoes holds the highest promise for success in malaria control strategies, opening completely new scenarios in malaria transmission-blocking drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Prevalent dysregulation of epigenetic modifications plays a pivotal role in cancer. Targeting epigenetic abnormality is a new strategy for cancer therapy. Understanding how conventional oncogenic factors cause epigenetic abnormality is of great basic and translational value. O-GlcNAcylation is a protein modification which affects physiology and pathophysiology. In mammals, O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by one single enzyme OGT and removed by one single enzyme OGA. O-GlcNAcylation is affected by the availability of the donor, UDP-GlcNAc, generated by the serial enzymatic reactions in the hexoamine biogenesis pathway (HBP). O-GlcNAcylation regulates a wide spectrum of substrates including many proteins involved in epigenetic modification. Like epigenetic modifications, abnormality of O-GlcNAcylation is also common in cancer. Studies have revealed substantial impact on HBP enzymes and OGT/OGA by oncogenic signals. In this review, we will first summarize how oncogenic signals regulate HBP enzymes, OGT and OGA in cancer. We will then integrate this knowledge with the up to date understanding how O-GlcNAcylation regulates epigenetic machinery. With this, we propose a signal axis from oncogenic signals through O-GlcNAcylation dysregulation to epigenetic abnormality in cancer. Further elucidation of this axis will not only advance our understanding of cancer biology but also provide new revenues towards cancer therapy.",

While surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are emerging as the standard treatment for OSCC patients, the outcome is limited to the recurrence and side effects. Therefore, patients with OSCC require alternative strategies for treatment. In this study, we aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and the mode of action of the novel curcumin analog, HO-3867, against human OSCC cells. We analysed the cytotoxicity of HO-3867 using MTT assay. In vitro mechanic studies were performed to determine whether MAPK pathway is involved in HO-3867 induced cell apoptosis. As the results, we found HO-3867 suppressed OSCC cells growth effectively. The flow cytometry data indicate that HO-3867 induce the sub-G1 phase. Moreover, we found that HO-3867 induced cell apoptosis by triggering formation of activated caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and PARP. After dissecting MAPK pathway, we found HO-3867 induced cell apoptosis via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 pathway. Our results suggest that HO-3867 is an effective anticancer agent as its induction of cell apoptosis through JNK1/2 pathway in human oral cancer cells.",

Among all six spices, clove and ginger exhibited strong antioxidant activity owing to higher phytochemical contents. Significant antifungal activity (IZD >/= 11 mm) was revealed by all six spices except hexane fraction of carom whereas strong antibacterial activity with lowest MIC was displayed by clove, ginger and chilli. DNA was successfully protected from oxidative damage by clove, ginger followed by chilli, java long pepper and carom but black pepper could only partially protect DNA damage even at 4 mg/ml concentration. Based on the DNA damage protecting potentials and antioxidant activities clove, ginger, java long pepper and carom may be utilized for neutraceuticals development. Antimicrobial activities suggested that clove, ginger, java long pepper and chilli may be useful as food preservatives. Fractionated bioactivity of the all the six HTS would help for targeted extraction and development of nutraceuticals from these commonly used medicinal spices.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus infections have been known to cause disease in animals since as early as the 1920s. However, only seven coronaviruses capable of causing human disease have been identified thus far. These Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) include the causes of the common cold, but more recent coronaviruses that have emerged (i.e. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) are associated with much greater morbidity and mortality. HCoVs have been relatively under-studied compared to other common respiratory infections, as historically they have presented with mild symptoms. This has led to a relatively limited understanding of their animal reservoirs, transmission and determinants of immune protection. To address this, human infection challenge studies with HCoVs have been performed that enable a detailed clinical and immunological analysis of the host response at specific time points under controlled conditions with standardised viral inocula. Until recently, all such human challenge studies were conducted with common cold HCoVs, with the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV unacceptable due to their greater pathogenicity. However, with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic during which severe outcomes in young healthy adults have been rare, human challenge studies with SARS-CoV-2 are now being developed. Two SARS-CoV-2 human challenge studies in the UK studying individuals with and without pre-existing immunity are underway. As well as providing a platform for testing of antivirals and vaccines, such studies will be critical for understanding the factors associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and thus developing improved strategies to tackle the current as well as future HCoV pandemics. Here, we summarise the major questions about protection and pathogenesis in HCoV infection that human infection challenge studies have attempted to answer historically, as well as the knowledge gaps that aim to be addressed with contemporary models.",

This study aimed to investigate the global dissemination of these plasmids using whole genome sequencing to provide better understanding on genetic characteristics. Sixty-seven complete plasmid genomes harboring mcr-1 were obtained. Phylogeny was built against full plasmid genomes. Different replicon types of plasmid were compared in terms of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), insertion sequence, and other functional genes. Five different replicon types of plasmid (IncX4, IncI2, IncP1, IncHIA, and IncFIB) were found to harbor mcr-1. IncX4 and IncI2 types of plasmid were well clustered in accordance with the country where they were isolated (and not as IncHIA and IncFIB). Three insertion sequences (ISApl1, ISKpn26, and IS1294) were identified in up- and/or downstream of mcr-1. Plasmids IncX4 and IncI2 were observed across the sample origin. Plasmids IncX4 showed high uniformity regardless of the origin of isolates and harbored H-NS coding genes, a facilitator for successful plasmid transfer. All three insertion sequences were observed in IncI2 plasmids. IncHI2 plasmids harbored various ARGs in addition to mcr-1. Our results elucidate the characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of complete mcr-1-harboring plasmids, indicating that global dissemination of mcr-1 is primarily owing to plasmid transfer rather than clonal spread.",

However, a 12-h follow-up abdominal X-ray showed manifestations of newly appeared step-ladder sign and the CT scan displayed mechanical obstruction in the left lower quadrant area. Upon laparoscopic examination, herniation of small bowel was observed through the intersigmoid recess.

        "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most frequent bacterial infections worldwide, with Escherichia coli being the main causative agent. The increase of antibiotic-resistance determinants among isolates from clinical samples, including UTIs, makes the development of novel therapeutic strategies a necessity. In this context, the use of bacteriophages as a therapeutic alternative has been proposed, due to their ability to efficiently kill bacteria. In this work, we isolated and characterized three novel bacteriophages, microbes laboratory phage 1 (MLP1), MLP2, and MLP3, belonging to the Chaseviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae families, respectively. These phages efficiently infect and kill laboratory reference strains and multidrug-resistant clinical E. coli isolates from patients with diagnosed UTIs. Interestingly, these phages are also able to infect intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, such as enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli. Our data show that the MLP phages recognize different regions of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule, an important virulence factor in bacteria that is also highly variable among different E. coli strains. Altogether, our results suggest that these phages may represent an interesting alternative for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant E. coli. IMPORTANCE Urinary tract infections affect approximately 150 million people annually. The current antibiotic resistance crisis demands the development of novel therapeutic alternatives. Our results show that three novel phages, MLP1, MLP2, and MLP3 are able to infect both laboratory and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. Since these phages (i) efficiently kill antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), (ii) recognize different portions of the LPS molecule, and (iii) are able to efficiently infect intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli hosts, we believe that these novel phages are good candidates to be used as a therapeutic alternative to treat antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains generating urinary tract and/or intestinal infections.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which emerged in December 2019, has caused millions of deaths and severe illness worldwide. Numerous vaccines are currently under development of which a few have now been authorised for population-level administration by several countries. As of 20 September 2021, over 48 million people have received their first vaccine dose and over 44 million people have received their second vaccine dose across the UK. We aim to assess the uptake rates, effectiveness, and safety of all currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use prospective cohort study designs to assess vaccine uptake, effectiveness and safety against clinical outcomes and deaths. Test-negative case-control study design will be used to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Self-controlled case series and retrospective cohort study designs will be carried out to assess vaccine safety against mild-to-moderate and severe adverse events, respectively. Individual-level pseudonymised data from primary care, secondary care, laboratory test and death records will be linked and analysed in secure research environments in each UK nation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models will be carried out to estimate vaccine uptake levels in relation to various population characteristics. VE estimates against laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection will be generated using a generalised additive logistic model. Time-dependent Cox models will be used to estimate the VE against clinical outcomes and deaths. The safety of the vaccines will be assessed using logistic regression models with an offset for the length of the risk period. Where possible, data will be meta-analysed across the UK nations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We obtained approvals from the National Research Ethics Service Committee, Southeast Scotland 02 (12/SS/0201), the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage independent Information Governance Review Panel project number 0911. Concerning English data, University of Oxford is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation and the National Health Service (NHS) Digital Data Security and Protection Policy. This is an approved study (Integrated Research Application ID 301740, Health Research Authority (HRA) Research Ethics Committee 21/HRA/2786). The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub meets NHS Digital's Data Security and Protection Toolkit requirements. In Northern Ireland, the project was approved by the Honest Broker Governance Board, project number 0064. Findings will be made available to national policy-makers, presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.",

The present study assessed the impact of transport and storage conditions on staling aldehyde evolution in lager beers across five sample groups (fresh, transport, and storage simulation, and their controls), which differed in their bottle opening system (either crown cap or ring pull cap). Maritime transport conditions (45 days of travel, vibrations of 1.7 Hz, and warm temperatures (21-30  degrees C)) were simulated, together with storage time in a distributor's warehouse (up to 75 days). The results revealed that the concentration of Strecker aldehydes increased more quickly after transport and storage simulation in beer bottles with the ring pull cap opening system, and the contents of 2-methylpropanal and 3-methylbutanal, in particular, were up to three times higher. Benzaldehyde content also increased significantly, by 33% on average, in these samples. Hexanal was only found in beers with a ring pull cap that underwent transport simulation. Further storage after transport simulation significantly reduced the content of 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal, and hexanal, by 73%, 57%, and 43%, respectively, suggesting the formation of a bound state. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was continuously increased by 78.5% and 40.5% after the Transport and Transport & Storage simulations, respectively. Transport conditions lead to a slight increase, of 0.6 EBC units, in beer color.",

        "abstract": "MerTK (Mer Tyrosine Kinase) is a cell surface receptor that regulates phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. POS phagocytosis is impaired in several pathologies, including diabetes. In this study, we investigate whether hyperglycemic conditions may affect MerTK expression and activation in ARPE-19 cells, a retinal pigment epithelial cellular model. ARPE-19 cells were cultured in standard (CTR) or high-glucose (HG) medium for 24 h. Then, we analyzed: mRNA levels and protein expression of MerTK and ADAM9, a protease that cleaves the extracellular region of MerTK; the amount of cleaved Mer (sMer); and the ability of GAS6, a MerTK ligand, to induce MerTK phosphorylation. Since HG reduces miR-126 levels, and ADAM9 is a target of miR-126, ARPE-19 cells were transfected with miR-126 inhibitor or mimic; then, we evaluated ADAM9 expression, sMer, and POS phagocytosis. We found that HG reduced expression and activation of MerTK. Contextually, HG increased expression of ADAM9 and the amount of sMer. Overexpression of miR-126 reduced levels of sMer and improved phagocytosis in ARPE-19 cells cultured with HG. In this study, we demonstrate that HG compromises MerTK expression and activation in ARPE-19 cells. Our results suggest that HG up-regulates ADAM9 expression, leading to increased shedding of MerTK. The consequent rise in sMer coupled to reduced expression of MerTK impairs binding and internalization of POS in ARPE-19 cells.",

The study pointed out that majority of the samples is brackish with two notable geochemical facies for pre monsoon and post monsoon. Factor and cluster analyses revealed that EC, TDS, Na(+), Cl(-), Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) are the major contributors. Gibb's diagram supported the dominance of rock weathering and evaporation in controlling the groundwater chemistry.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Home-visiting programs are a common and effective public health approach to promoting parent and child well-being, including in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization and UNICEF have identified responsive caregiving as one key component of the nurturing care children need to survive and thrive. Nonetheless, the importance of responsive caregiving and how to coach it is often overlooked in trainings for staff in home-visiting programs. METHODS: To determine whether it is possible to enhance home-visitors' understanding of responsive caregiving and how to coach it, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial with 181 staff working in Brazil's national home-visiting program. We used a computerized random number generator to randomly assign half of participants to take an online professional development course about responsive caregiving immediately and the other half to a waitlist. Individuals assessing outcome data were blind to group assignment. RESULTS: Compared to those in the control group (N = 90, both randomized and analyzed), participants assigned to take the course (N = 91, both randomized and analyzed) were more knowledgeable about responsivity (Cohen's d = 0.64, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.34, 0.94) and its importance for children's socioemotional (odds ratio (OR) = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.00, 3.50) and cognitive (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.15, 5.71) development, better able to identify responsive parental behaviors in videotaped interactions (d = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.51, 2.21), and suggested more effective strategies for coaching parents on responsivity (d = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.80) and tracking goal implementation (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.28, 7.99). There were no significant changes in participants' tendency to encourage goal setting and reflection, or their perspective-taking skills. Participants were very satisfied with the course content and mode of delivery and there was no drop-out from the program. CONCLUSIONS: A short, online professional development program created moderate to large improvements in home-visitors' knowledge and intended coaching practices. This suggests that such programs are feasible, even in low-income and rural areas, and provide a low-cost, scalable option for possibly maximizing the impact of home-visiting programs - particularly with regard to parental responsivity, and in turn, child outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal calves are relatively susceptible to heat loss, and previous research suggests that reduced environmental temperatures are associated with reduced average daily gain (ADG) during the preweaning phase. Current methods of mitigating negative effects of colder environmental conditions include the use of calf jackets and the provision of supplementary heat sources; however, previous research is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of calf jackets and 1-kW heat lamps on the growth rates of preweaning calves and evaluate associations between environmental temperature and ADG using a Bayesian approach to incorporate both current and previous data. Seventy-nine calves from a single British dairy farm were randomly allocated at birth to 1 of the following 4 groups: no jacket and no heat lamp, heat lamp but no jacket, jacket but no heat lamp, or both heat lamp and jacket between January and April of 2021. Calves were weighed at both birth and at approximately 21 d of age. Temperature was recorded both inside and outside of the calf building, and in pens both with and without heat lamps using data loggers. To explore the effect of treatment group and environmental temperature on ADG, a fixed effects model was fitted over 1,000 bootstrap samples. The effect of environmental temperature on ADG was further explored within a Bayesian framework that used temperature and ADG data for 484 calves from 16 farms available from a previous trial as prior information. Calves housed under a 1-kW heat lamp had an increased ADG of 0.09 kg/d (95% bootstrap confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.20 kg/d), and no effect of jacket or interactions between jacket and heat lamp were found. A significant positive association was identified between the mean environmental temperature of the calf building and ADG, with a 1 degrees C increase in temperature being associated with a 0.03 kg/d increase in ADG (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 0.01 to 0.04 kg/d). Associations between environmental temperature and ADG were further evaluated within a Bayesian framework, and posterior estimates were 0.014 kg/d of ADG per 1 degrees C increase (95% credible interval: 0.009 to 0.021 kg/d). This study demonstrated that a 1-kW heat lamp was effective in increasing ADG in calves, and no significant effect of calf jacket on ADG was found. A significant, positive effect of increased pen temperature on calf ADG was identified in this study and was reinforced when including prior information from previous research within a Bayesian framework.",

Our data here paint a different picture: large-scale exchange of cellular material through EVs. To visualize the dynamic production and cellular uptake of EVs, we used correlative confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, as well as flow cytometry to interrogate labeled cells. Using cells expressing fluorescent proteins (GFP, miRFP703) and cells tagged with protein and RNA dyes, we show that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells dynamically produce and uptake EVs to exchange proteins and RNAs at a large scale. Applying a simple model to our data, we estimate, for the first time, the per cell-specific rates of EV production (68 and 203 microparticles and exosomes, respectively, per day). This EV-mediated massive exchange of cellular material observed in CHO cultures was also observed in cultured human CHRF-288-11 and primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This study demonstrates an underappreciated massive protein and RNA exchange between cells mediated by EVs spanning cell type, suggesting that the proximity of cells in normal and tumor tissues may also result in prolific exchange of cellular material. This exchange would be expected to homogenize the cell-population cytosol and dynamically regulate cell proliferation and the cellular state.",

OBJECTIVE: To describe how patients experience transgender clinics and how these experiences compare to those experiences in other settings. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one adult patients of a gender health program. DESIGN AND APPROACH: Semi-structured interviews of transgender patients. The interviews focused on two domains: healthcare experiences and relationships with healthcare providers. KEY RESULTS: Overall, transgender patients expressed a need for healthcare services, particularly for primary care, that are partially met by the comprehensive care clinic model. Limitations in access included the lack of willing providers, where the patients live, and long wait times for appointments. Participants recounted a range of experiences, both positive and negative, with providers outside of the transgender clinic, but only positive experiences to share about providers from the transgender clinic. CONCLUSION: Outside specialty transgender settings, many patients had negative experiences with providers who were unwilling or unable to provide care. This study speaks to the need for primary care providers who can and will treat transgender patients, as well as the need for healthcare spaces that feel safe to transgender patents.",

Studies on the chloroplast genomes of them are favorable for understanding the diversity and phylogeny of Zygophyllaceae. Here, we sequenced and assembled the whole chloroplast genomes of T. mongolica, Z. xanthoxylon, and Z. fabago, and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis. The total size, structure, gene content and orders of these three chloroplast genomes were similar, and the three chloroplast genomes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with a large single-copy region (LSC; 79,696-80,291 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC; 16,462-17,162 bp), and two inverted repeats (IRs; 4,288-4,413 bp). A total of 107 unique genes were identified from the three chloroplast genomes, including 70 protein-coding genes, 33 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. Compared with other angiosperms, the three chloroplast genomes were significantly reduced in overall length due to an unusual 16-24 kb shrinkage of IR regions and loss of the 11 genes which encoded subunits of NADH dehydrogenase. Genome-wide comparisons revealed similarities and variations between the three species and others. Phylogenetic analysis based on the three chloroplast genomes supported the opinion that Zygophyllaceae belonged to Zygophyllales in Fabids, and Z. xanthoxylon and Z. fabago belonged to Zygophyllum. The genome-wide comparisons revealed the similarity and variations between the chloroplast genomes of the three Zygophylloideae species and other plant species.

        "abstract": "Maintenance of energy balance between intake and expenditure is a prerequisite of human health, disrupted in severe metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), mainly due to accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT). WAT undergoes a morphological and energetic remodelling toward brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the BAT activation has anti-obesity potential. The mechanisms or the regulatory factors able to activate BAT thermogenesis have been only partially deciphered. Identifying novel regulators of BAT induction is a question of great importance for fighting obesity and T2D. Here, we evaluated the role of Hif3alpha in murine pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line, a versatile and well characterized biological model of adipogenesis, by gain- and loss-of function approaches and in thermogenesis-induced model in vivo. HIF3A is regulated by inflammation, it modulates lypolysis in adipose tissue of obese adults, but its role in energy metabolism has not previously been investigated. We characterized gene and protein expression patterns of adipogenesis and metabolic activity in vitro and mechanistically in vivo. Overexpression of Hif3alpha in differentiating adipocytes increases white fat cells, whereas silencing of Hif3alpha promotes \"browning\" of white cells, activating thermogenesis through upregulation of Ucp1, Elovl3, Prdm16, Dio2 and Ppargc1a genes. Investigating cell metabolism, Seahorse Real-Time Cell Metabolism Analysis showed that silencing of Hif3alpha resulted in a significant increase of mitochondrial uncoupling with a concomitant increase in acetyl-CoA metabolism and Sirt1 and Sirt3 expression. The causal Hif3alpha/Ucp1 inverse relation has been validated in Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) knockout, a thermogenesis-induced model in vivo. Our data indicate that Hif3alpha inhibition triggers \"browning\" of white adipocytes activating the beneficial thermogenesis rewiring energy metabolism in vitro and in vivo. HIF3A is a novel player that controls the energy metabolism with potential applications in developing therapy to fight metabolic disorders, as obesity, T2D and ultimately cancer.",

        "abstract": "Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most widely cultivated forage crops in the world. China is the second largest producer of alfalfa in terms of the planting area worldwide, with Gansu, Henan, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi provinces being the production hubs. Alfalfa viruses have been reported on a small-scale survey in some of these areas, but they have not been well characterized. In the present study, seven viruses were detected in 12 fields of 10 cities/counties of the four abovementioned provinces by high-throughput sequencing and assembly of small RNA. Their incidence, distribution, and genetic diversity were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/reverse transcription-PCR and clone sequencing. The results showed that alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), pea streak virus (PeSV), lucerne transient streak virus (LTSV), alfalfa dwarf virus (ADV), Medicago sativa alphapartitivirus 1 (MsAPV1), MsAPV2, and alfalfa leaf curl virus (ALCV) were the main viruses infecting alfalfa in four examined provinces. AMV and MsAPV1 had the highest incidences in all 4 provinces. SDT analysis of the 7 viruses isolated in China revealed a highly conserved among AMV, LTSV, ADV, MsAPV1, MsAPV2, and ALCV, but the sequence was a high variation between China isolates to abroad isolates in PeSV, ADV, and ALCV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ADV in Inner Mongolia and Gansu, ALCV in Inner Mongolia, MsAPV1 and MsAPV2 in all 4 provinces, and PeSV and LTSV in China. These findings provide a basis for future research on the genetic evolution of alfalfa viruses in China and on strategies to prevent diseases in alfalfa caused by these viruses.",

The underlying mechanism and source of this distinct immunologic condition three months or more after initial infection remains elusive. Here, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein in 46 individuals. We analyzed T-cell, B-cell, and monocytic subsets in both severe COVID-19 patients and in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The levels of both intermediate (CD14+, CD16+) and non-classical monocyte (CD14Lo, CD16+) were significantly elevated in PASC patients up to 15 months post-acute infection compared to healthy controls (P=0.002 and P=0.01, respectively). A statistically significant number of non-classical monocytes contained SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein in both severe (P=0.004) and PASC patients (P=0.02) out to 15 months post-infection. Non-classical monocytes were sorted from PASC patients using flow cytometric sorting and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Cells from 4 out of 11 severe COVID-19 patients and 1 out of 26 PASC patients contained ddPCR+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, however, only fragmented SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in PASC patients. No full length sequences were identified, and no sequences that could account for the observed S1 protein were identified in any patient. That non-classical monocytes may be a source of inflammation in PASC warrants further study.",

In the S1 system (BOFS/deionized water pH 2.5), the stability of the residue was evaluated for 408 h under agitation. The results showed that only Ca and Mg were solubilized, and the pH increased from 2.5 up to 11.4 within the initial 24 h and kept still until the end of the experiment (408 h). The S2 system (BOFS/AMDi) achieved 100% removal of As and Mn, and 70% removal of sulfate after 648 h. In the first 30 min, the pH increased from 2.5 to 10, which was maintained until the end of the experiment. The removal of As, Mn, and sulfate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (S3 and S4 systems - BOFS/AMDi/H(2)O(2)) was similar to that in the S2 system, which contained only BOFS. The formation of iron oxides was not accelerated by H(2)O(2). As regards the removal of arsenic and sulfate species, the formation of incipient calcium arsenate and calcium sulfate dehydrated was indicated by X-ray diffraction analysis and PHREEQC modeling. Dissolved manganese and magnesium precipitated as oxides, according to the geochemical modeling. After contact with AMDi, the raw BOFS, initially classified as hazardous waste, became a non-inert waste, which implies simplified, less costly disposal. Except for sulfate, the concentrations of all the other elements were below the maximum permitted levels.",

        "abstract": "Forensic handwriting examiners (FHE) activities are focused on comparative analysis of handwritten objects such as signatures. Their role is to provide and evaluate evidence for and against the authenticity of a questioned signature. In recent years, cases involving handwritten signatures captured on electronic devices have become more commonplace. These so-called 'dynamic signatures' (also known as 'digitally captured signatures') are much different from paper-based signatures. Not only does the medium of recording differ, but also the type, volume of data and features are different from the pattern-based evidence that makes up paper-based signatures. Recent developments in forensic science - including signature examination - have led to the adoption of evaluative probabilistic methodologies in many disciplines [see, e.g. ENFSI 1915 Guidelines]. In the current paper, a probabilistic model to evaluate signature evidence in the form of multivariate data, as proposed and described in Wacom Europe GmbH (2019), is adopted. Topics like data sparsity, joint evaluation of multiple features and feature selection are investigated. Performed experimental studies showed an accuracy rate above 90% even when a limited number (5) of reference signatures was available. The performances of a multivariate approach are compared with those characterizing a so-called multiplicative approach where variables (features) are taken as independent and the Bayes' factor (BF) is obtained as the product of univariate BFs associated to each selected feature. The simplicity of this latter approach is, however, accompanied by severe issues about the reliability of results. The use of a multivariate approach is therefore highly recommended. Finally, the evidential values in correspondence of alternative feature sets are compared. Results suggest that discriminative features are writer-related and necessitate a case-specific selection.",

However, early pleural effusion is uncommon in this malignancy. CASE SUMMARY: The case of a 32-year-old male patient who visited our facility with symptoms of cough and gradually aggravated shortness of breath was reported. X-ray examination revealed a massive left hydrothorax. The patient underwent thoracocentesis, and pleural fluid tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, neuron-specific enolase, and cytokeratin 21-1 fragment, were significantly elevated. A similar tendency was observed among the serum tumor markers. After draining the pleural effusion, the patient underwent chest computed tomography, and no obvious mass was found in the lung. Thoracoscopy revealed that the left visceral pleura was covered with nodular, cauliflower-like protrusions of various sizes. These histopathological results suggested cancerous cells, and the immunohistochemical findings were consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. It tested positive for cytokeratin, cytokeratin 5/6, carcinoembryonic antigen, and thyroid transcription factor-1. CONCLUSION: The patient was diagnosed with a rare case of lung mucinous adenocarcinoma. Subsequent genetic testing was positive for epidermal growth factor receptor-21 mutations and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-lymphoma anaplastic kinase fusion. This prompted treatment with alfatinib and crizotinib.",

Depression is associated with increased mortality in the general population and individuals with cardiovascular diseases, but this is sparsely studied for AAA. The aim was to examine the prognostic impact of depressive symptoms on all-cause mortality in individuals with AAA and compare with findings in a general population of the same age and risk profile. METHODS: Population-based prospective study including 36 616 participants (52.1% women) from the Trondelag Health Study in Norway. A total of 9428 individuals died during a median follow-up of 10 years at ages 60-90 years. Depressive symptoms were defined by a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression score >/=8. Data on AAA diagnoses and death were obtained from medical records and national registers. HRs from Cox proportional hazard regression models are reported. RESULTS: A total of 4832 (13.2%) individuals reported depressive symptoms, whereas 583 (1.6%) AAAs were identified. The adjusted hazard of death was 2.66 times higher in persons with AAA compared with the general population (95% CI 2.39 to 2.97). Overall, there was no significant adverse effect of depressive symptoms in individuals with AAA (HR 1.15;95% CI 0.88 to 1.51), whereas an increased risk was seen in the general population (HR 1.23;95% CI 1.17 to 1.30). CONCLUSION: The overall risk of death was considerably higher in individuals with AAA compared with a general population of the same age and risk profile. Depressive symptoms did not significantly influence the risk of death in the AAA group.",

        "abstract": "Helicoverpa armigera (Ha), a polyphagous pest, causes significant damage to several crop plants, including cotton. The control of this cosmopolitan pest is largely challenging due to the development of resistance to existing management practices. The Juvenile Hormone (JH) plays a pivotal role in the life cycle of insects by regulating their morphogenetic and gonadotropic development. Hence, enzymes involved in JH biosynthesis are an attractive target for the development of selective insecticides. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), a member protein of (E)-prenyl-transferases, is one of the most crucial enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of JHs. It catalyzes the condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), forming farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), a precursor of JH. The study was designed to identify an effective small inhibitory molecule that could inhibit the activity of Helicoverpa armigera - FPPS (HaFPPS) for an effective pest control intervention. Therefore, a 3D model of FPPS protein was generated using homology modeling. The FooDB database library of small molecules was selected for virtual screening, following which binding affinities were evaluated using docking studies. Three top-scored molecules were analyzed for various pharmacophore properties. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis showed that the identified molecules (mitraphylline-ZINC1607834, chlorogenic acid-ZINC2138728 and llagate-ZINC3872446) had a reasonably acceptable binding affinity for HaFPPS and resulted in the formation of a stable HaFPPS-inhibitor(s) complex. The identified phytochemical molecules may be used as potent inhibitors of HaFPPS thus, paving the way for further developing environment-friendly insect growth regulator(s).

Membrane filters (4.7 cm(2)) removed significant amounts of sulfide-bound Cu from 10 mL of wine, including 60-80 % removal using nylon membranes, but they could not efficiently remove Cu from larger volumes. Dissolved oxygen concentration in the wine immediately prior to membrane filtration did not impact Cu removal, while a high sulfide-to-Cu(II) ratio did enhance removal.

        "abstract": "Neutrophils are the most abundant innate immune cells in human circulation; however, their derived exosomes have been rarely studied for tumor treatment. Here, we reported that exosomes from neutrophils (N-Ex) induce tumor cell apoptosis by delivering cytotoxic proteins and activating caspase signaling pathway. In addition, we decorated N-Ex with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to achieve higher tumor-targeting therapeutic effect. We further fabricated exosome-like nanovesicles from neutrophils (NNVs) at high yield. Compared with liposome-loaded doxorubicin (DOX) and natural NNVs, DOX-loaded NNVs show an improved inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, DOX-loaded, SPION-decorated NNVs selectively accumulate at the tumor sites under an external magnetic field, effectively restraining tumor growth and extensively prolonging the survival rate in mice. Overall, a simple and effective method to engineer N-Ex and NNVs at clinical applicable scale was developed, which enables the efficient and safe drug delivery for targeted and combined tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of long-term graft dysfunction in patients with heart transplantation and is linked with significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing CAV is coronary imaging with intravascular ultrasound during traditional invasive coronary angiography. Invasive imaging, however, carries increased procedural risk and expense to patients in addition to requiring an experienced interventionalist. With the improvements in non-invasive cardiac imaging modalities such as transthoracic echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, an alternative non-invasive imaging approach for the early detection of CAV may be feasible. In this systematic review, we explored the literature to investigate the utility of non-invasive imaging in diagnosis of CAV in >3000 patients across 49 studies. We also discuss the strengths and weaknesses for each imaging modality. Overall, all 4 imaging modalities show good to excellent accuracy for identifying CAV with significant variations across studies. Majority of the studies compared non-invasive imaging with invasive coronary angiography without intravascular imaging. In summary, non-invasive imaging modalities offer an alternative approach to invasive coronary imaging for CAV. Future studies should investigate longitudinal non-invasive protocols in low-risk patients after heart transplantation.",

LN status influences clinical management and the prognosis of patients. We explored the relationship between patient obesity and regional patterns of LN involvement in PTC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the data from 12,772 PTC patients. The rate of LN metastasis, number of LN metastasis, maximum diameter of positive LN, number of dissected LN, and LN ratios (LNR) were compared between normal-weight and obese patients. Statistical methods have been adjusted for the confounders in hypothesis testing. RESULTS: Overweight and obesity were independent risk factor for metastatic LNs (OR(1) = 1.125, 95% CI 1.042-1.214, P(1) = 0.003; OR(2) = 1.554, 95% CI 1.339-1.802, P(2) <0.001). Obesity was an independent risk factor for the number of metastatic CLNs (OR=1.159, 95% CI 0.975-1.377, P=0.045), however not for number of metastatic lateral LNs (P=0.907). Furthermore, obesity was not an independent risk factor for number of CLNs when dissected more than five (P=0.653), still an independent risk factors for number of metastatic lateral LNs when more than six (OR=1.185, 95% CI 1.010-1.391, P=0.037). As for LNR, obesity was an independent risk factor for the central LNR when more than 0.12 (OR (adjusted 1) = 1.099, 95% CI 1.011-1.194, P(1) = 0.027; OR (adjusted 2) = 1.177, 95% CI 1.003-1.381, P(2) = 0.045), for the lateral LNR more than 0.05 (P(2) = 0.283). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was associated with poor prognoses with PTC respecting LNs. Surgeons should be extreme caution when performing central neck dissection in obese patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Distant metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is rare but fatal, and its relationship with patient age remains unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the association between age at diagnosis and metachronous distant metastasis in PTMC. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy for PTC measuring 10 mm or less at a tertiary hospital from January 2000 to December 2016 were enrolled. Patients who had evidence of distant metastasis at diagnosis or underwent postoperative radioiodine (RAI) ablation were excluded. A Cox proportional hazards model with restricted cubic splines (RCS) was applied to examine the association between age at diagnosis and distant metastasis. RESULTS: A total of 4,749 patients were evaluated. The median age was 44 years (range, 8-78 years), and 3,700 (78%) were female. After a median follow-up of 65 months, 21 distant metastases (20 lung, 1 liver) were recognized. A univariate Cox proportional model using a 5-knot RCS revealed a significant overall (p = 0.01) and a potential nonlinear association (p = 0.08) between distant metastasis and age at diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, age at diagnosis, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), and lymph node metastasis (pN+) were independent risk factors for distant metastasis. Compared with the middle-aged group (30-45 years old), younger and older patients had a higher risk of distant metastasis [HR, 95% CI, p-value, age </= 30, 4.54 (0.91-22.60), 0.06, age > 45, 6.36 (1.83-22.13), <0.01]. CONCLUSION: Age at diagnosis is associated with metachronous distant metastasis of PTMC, and patients with younger or older age have a higher risk of distant metastasis than middle-aged patients.",

Once thought to be extinct, remnant wild populations were discovered in 2001 and limited captive individuals identified in pagoda ponds or confiscated from fishers in Myanmar. These and their offspring are maintained in five facilities in Myanmar and form the basis of a conservation program (habitat protection, captive breeding, nest protection, egg collection, head-starting, and release). Prerelease health screenings were performed in 2014 and 2018 at Yadanabon Zoological Gardens, a head-starting facility in Limpha Village, and Lawkanandar Wildlife Park. One hundred forty-three turtles were assessed (37 male, 50 female, 56 juveniles [too young to determine sex]; two females were assessed in both years), age range of 1 to 12 y (one unknown age adult founder), and body mass range of 0.111 to 32.72 kg. Health evaluations both years included physical examination and combined choanal/cloacal swab samples for polymerase chain reaction testing of the potential chelonian pathogens intranuclear coccidia, Mycoplasma, Herpesvirus, Ranavirus, and Adenovirus (not all tests performed each year). In 2018, cloacal swabs from 30 and 20 turtles at the Yadanabon Zoological Gardens and Lawkanandar Wildlife Park, respectively, were cultured for Salmonella. All turtles were assessed as healthy based on normal physical examination findings, and all had negative test results. Prerelease health screening, such as performed in this study, is an important component of release, reintroduction, and translocation projects to prevent introduction of novel pathogens into naive wild populations.",

        "abstract": "The feeding value and impact of hemp stubble in the diet of ruminants is unknown. Fifteen Merino castrated male sheep were maintained in individual pens and fed one of three pelletized experimental inclusion diets, as a 0% (Control), 28% (Hemp 1), and 56% (Hemp 2) pellet that delivered a diet meeting the nutrient requirements of the animals. Inclusion of hemp stubble had no effect (P > 0.05) on either DM intake, live weight gain or the feed to gain ratio but positively impacted (P < 0.05) on nutrient digestibility. Hemp stubble inclusion increased the concentration (but not molar proportions) of acetic and butyric acids and increased both the concentrations and molar proportions of iso-butyric, iso-valeric, hexanoic and heptanoic acids, possibly due to increased protein digestibility and/or changes in the composition of rumen cellulolytic bacteria. Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) was the only cannabinoid found in plasma in the sheep fed the hemp-containing diets, and this was found at very low concentrations (<16 mug/L). The psychoactive cannabinoid delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta (9)-THC) was not detected in any plasma samples. THCA was detected in the liver of two sheep fed the Hemp 1 pellets and two sheep fed the Hemp 2 pellets. Cannabidiol (CBD) was detected in the liver of one sheep fed the Hemp 2 pellets (but no liver THCA was detected in this sheep). Delta (9)-THC was detected in both the kidney fat and subcutaneous fat of all sheep fed hemp stubble, with the concentrations being higher (P < 0.05) in the sheep fed the Hemp 1 pellets. THCA was also detected in the subcutaneous fat of one of the sheep fed the Hemp 1 pellets. Four of the five sheep fed the Hemp 1 pellet and one of the five sheep fed Hemp 2 pellet had detectable levels of Delta (9)-THC in the meat (loin). No other cannabinoids were detected in the meat. Current food standards regulations in Australia prohibit presence of any cannabinoid residues in commercial meat products; thus, determination of a withholding period is required to enable the safe feeding of hemp-stubble to sheep. Further research is also required to gain a greater understanding of the rumen metabolism of cannabinoids.",

Release kinetics were measured in vitro and in vivo with MRI, using gadolinium-labeled albumin (Galbumin), which demonstrated prolonged release over multiple weeks. Subsequently, this hydrogel was used for long-term delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) (Gel VEGF + Ang1, n = 14), in a photothrombotically induced cortical stroke lesion in rats. Control stroke animals were intralesionally injected with saline (Saline, n = 10), non-loaded gel (Gel, n = 10), or a single bolus of VEGF + Ang1 in saline (Saline VEGF + Ang1, n = 10). MRI was executed to guide hydrogel injection. Functional recovery was assessed with sensorimotor function tests, while tissue status and vascularization were monitored by serial in vivo MRI. Significant recovery from sensorimotor deficits from day 28 onwards was only measured in the Gel VEGF + Ang1 group. This was accompanied by significantly increased vascularization in the perilesional cortex. Histology confirmed (re)vascularization and neuronal sparing in perilesional areas. In conclusion, intralesional injection of in situ-forming hydrogel loaded with pro-angiogenic factors can support prolonged brain tissue regeneration and promote functional recovery in the chronic phase post-stroke.",

Specifically, we quantified the percentages of collagen beams with/without vessels and of vessels inside/outside of collagen beams. To do this, the vasculature of six normal monkey eyes was labeled by perfusion post-mortem. After enucleation, coronal cryosections through the LC were imaged using fluorescence and polarized light microscopy to visualize the blood vessels and collagen beams, respectively. The images were registered to form 3D volumes. Beams and vessels were segmented, and their spatial interrelationship was quantified in 3D. We found that 22% of the beams contained a vessel (range 14%-32%), and 21% of vessels were outside beams (13%-36%). Stated differently, 78% of beams did not contain a vessel (68%-86%), and 79% of vessels were inside a beam (64%-87%). Individual monkeys differed significantly in the fraction of vessels outside beams (p < 0.01 by linear mixed effect analysis), but not in the fraction of beams with vessels (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences between contralateral eyes in the percent of beams with vessels and of vessels outside beams (p > 0.05). Our results show that the vascular and collagenous networks of the LC in monkey are clearly distinct, and the historical notions that each LC beam contains a vessel and all vessels are within beams are inaccurate. We postulate that vessels outside beams may be relatively more vulnerable to mechanical compression by elevated IOP than are vessels shielded inside of beams.",

Analysis of the pairwise genetic distances between coI mtDNA gene sequences revealed a low divergence between the two specimens of A. minutus (1.1%) and a greater divergence (up to 16.6%) between them and A. winterbourni. Since other Atriophallophorus spp. are known to have a strict specificity to the polyvalent intermediate host, we suggest that A. minutus reported from different snail species may represent a complex of cryptic species.",

Therefore, person-centered community care for individual service and support in the community is an urgent priority. This study aimed to develop a person-centered community service for mild dementia patient to collaborate with local cooperatives and test its feasibility. METHODS: This study was done from March to December, 2020. The person centered community service manual was developed based on previous guidelines and studies. The manual guided person-centered assessment, tailored intervention, and outcome evaluation based on six domains; person-hood, daily life, cognitive health, physical activity, safety, and community support. The local cooperatives for community care participated to provide comprehensive needs assessment and individualized service to the community residents with mild dementia. The staff visited the patient's home and provide individual service. The feasibility study was tested with the staff and patients. RESULTS: This study found that the service was effective for initial rapport, comprehensive assessment, individualized planning, person-centered service provision, referral to community service, and outcome evaluation. However, service provider's increased workloads and the time for home visiting and completing the service were identified as barriers during pandemic period. In addition, service providers still experienced lack of knowledge and skills in enhancing safety such as precaution and social distancing. CONCLUSION: The person-centered community service can be useful to enhance the safe and sustainable community services during COVID-19 pandemics. Collaboration with local cooperatives can be the best practices through the well-designed manual.",

The molecular targets of contryphans are controversial, and the identification of its interacting proteins may be of great importance. METHODS: His-tag pull-down assays were performed to investigate intracellular binding proteins of contryphan-Bt from rat brain lysate. Bt-Acp-[His](6), a contryphan-Bt derivative containing hexahistidine tag, was synthesized and used as the bait. As a control, Acp-[His](6) was used to exclude nonspecific bindings. RESULTS: Glutamine synthetase was identified as a potential contryphan-Bt binding protein by pull-- down assays and subsequent LC-MS/MS. The binding of contryphan-Bt to glutamine synthetase was confirmed and determined using microscale thermophoresis, with a Kd of 74.02 +/- 2.8 muM. The binding did not affect glutamine synthetase activity, suggesting that the interaction site was distinct from the catalytic center.

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Blood is an essential body fluid primarily required for regulating the body's systems and maintaining homeostasis. In developed and developing countries, concern about the demand and supply for blood is increasing. The current study aims to assess the beliefs, behaviors, and opinions of the public toward blood donation. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which a self-created questionnaire with 17-items was used for data collection. The self-administered questionnaire was disseminated between November 2019 and January 2020 through social media (WhatsApp(c) and Facebook(c)). Data was analyzed using SPSS program version 26. Results: A total of 356 questionnaires were completed with a response rate of 89%. The majority of participants were male 253 (71.1%), 336 (94.4%) considered blood donation important, 350 (98.3%) believed that blood donation saves lives, and 254 (71.3%) agreed to receive blood from voluntary donors. One-hundred sixty-seven (49.4%) were willing to donate blood voluntarily. The barriers to blood donation were fear of needles 86 (24.2%), fear of contracting a chronic disease 84 (23.6%), and lack of time 40 (11.2%). One day off (91.9%) and receiving a token 73.6% were common motivational factors for blood donation. Overall, 57% of the participants had favorable attitudes toward blood donation and 41.9% were knowledgeable. Favorable attitudes were significantly associated with being married (P = 0.018) and having university level of education (P = 0.005). Younger participants (18-29 years) had a statistically significant better knowledge than older participants (>/=30 years). Conclusion: The respondents displayed positive beliefs, opinions, and motivation toward blood donation. Additionally, most of them considered blood donation an important act and a national duty of every individual and are willing to donate in the future.",

The LAH4 amphipathic helical sequences exhibit a multitude of interesting biological properties such as antimicrobial activity, cell penetration of a large variety of cargo and lentiviral transduction enhancement. The parent peptide associates with lipid bilayers where it changes from an orientation along the membrane interface into a transmembrane configuration in a pH-dependent manner. Here we show that LAH4 adopts a transmembrane configuration in fully saturated DMPC membranes already at pH 3.5, i.e. much below the pK(a) of the histidines whereas the transition pH in POPC correlates closely with histidine neutralization. In contrast in POPG membranes the in-planar configuration is stabilized by about one pH unit. The differences in pH can be converted into energetic contributions for the in-plane to transmembrane transition equilibrium, where the shift in the transition pH due to lipid saturation corresponds to energies which are otherwise obtained by the exchange of several cationic with hydrophobic residues. A similar dependence on lipid saturation has also been observed when the PGLa and magainin antimicrobial peptides interact within lipid bilayers suggesting that the quantitative evaluation presented in this paper also applies to other membrane polypeptides.",

        "abstract": "Catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS) (or collectively known as persulfate, PS) using carbocatalyst is increasingly gaining attention as a promising technology for sustainable recalcitrant pollutant removal in water. Single heteroatom doping using either N, S, B or P is widely used to enhance the performance of the carbocatalyst for PS activation. However, the performance enhancement from single heteroatom doping is limited by the type of heteroatom used. To further enhance the performance of the carbocatalyst beyond the limit of single heteroatom doping, multi-heteroatom doping can be conducted. This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview on the development of multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst for PS activation. The potential synergistic and antagonistic interactions of various heteroatoms including N and B, N and S, N and P, and N and halogen for PS activation are evaluated. Thereafter, the preparation strategies to develop multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst including one-step and multi-step preparation approaches along with the characterization techniques are discussed. Evidence and summary of the performance of multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst for various recalcitrant pollutants removal via PS activation are also provided. Finally, the prospects of employing multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst including the need to study the correlation between different heteroatom combination, surface moiety type, and amount of dopant with the PS activation mechanism, identifying the best heteroatom combination, improving the durability of the carbocatalyst, evaluating the feasibility for full-scale application, developing low-cost multi-heteroatom-doped carbocatalyst, and assessing the environmental impact are also briefly discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of tranexamic acid versus placebo after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, and randomized study involved 66 patients who consecutively underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair from 2020 to 2021 at our hospital. Thirty-three shoulders each were randomly assigned to the tranexamic acid and control groups. In the former group, 1000 mg of tranexamic acid (20 mL) was administered intravenously 10 min before surgery and the same volume of normal saline (20 mL) was administered intravenously in the control group. We evaluated visual clarity; visual analog scale pain scores at rest, during activity, and at night; the circumference and diameter of the shoulder joint in the groups before and after the surgery at 1, 2, and 3 days, and 1 week; estimated perioperative blood loss; and operative time. Visual clarity was rated using a numeric rating scale from grade 1 (poor) to grade 3 (clear) every 15 min throughout the surgery. We compared and analyzed the results between the groups. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: Visual clarity was found to be significantly better in the tranexamic acid group, with a greater percentage of grade 3 visual clarity (75.6 +/- 11.2% vs 68.1 +/- 13.4%, p = 0.045). The visual analog scale scores at rest and at night in the control group were significantly lower than those in the tranexamic acid group for 1 week postoperatively (13.8 +/- 14.8 vs 5 +/- 9.3, p = 0.008, 36.1 +/- 23.3 vs 19.3 +/- 24, p = 0.012). The circumference and diameter of the shoulder joint, estimated perioperative blood loss, and operative time were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Intravenous administration of tranexamic acid is an alternative way to improve visual clarity in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; however, there are no other significant differences compared to the administration of placebo.",

Our objective was to assess the use of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) from single-donor platelets (al-PRP), using one freeze-thaw cycle, for treating CNHWs. We conducted a cross-sectional study. A total of 23 CNHWs being treated with al-PRP. The al-PRP treatment can be considered successful in well over half (n = 13, 56.5%) of the wounds. We found that all the wounds treated for up to 7 weeks showed partial or complete healing, while those treated for between 8 and 12 weeks did not show healing, healing again being successful in cases in which treatment was extended to more than 13 weeks (85.7%). Using chi-square tests, this relationship was found to be highly significant (p < 0.001, chi(2) = 19.51; p value = 0.00006). Notably, Cramer's V coefficient was very high (0.921), indicating that the effect size of PRP treatment duration on healing is very large (84.8%). We could suggest that the use of al-PRP in the healing of CNHWs is a promising approach. Further studies with larger sample sizes and long follow-ups are needed to obtain multivariate models to explain which factors favour the healing of ulcers treated with PRP.",

Methods: Human primary RPE (hRPE) cells and ARPE-19 cells were cultured with or without 10 nM of rapamycin for 6 h before being exposed to 10 muM of 7-KC for 24 h. The transcriptome of 7-KC challenged ARPE-19 cells was investigated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The effects of 7-KC and rapamycin on the viability of ARPE-19 cells were measured with CCK-8. Gene expression was verified by real-time PCR, and protein levels were determined by ELISA or Western blotting. Results: The expression of IL-6, IL-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RPE cells was markedly increased after stimulation with 7-KC for 12/24 h compared with the controls. RNA-seq showed that a total of 10,243 genes were differentially expressed, with 5,518 genes upregulated and 4,725 genes downregulated between the 7-KC treated and the control group. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis showed that 7-KC stimulation activated mTOR signaling and other pathways, including adherent junction, MAPK, and Wnt signalings. mTOR inhibitor rapamycin significantly suppressed the elevation of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF stimulated by 7-KC. Rapamycin not only decreased the level of phosphorylated mTOR, P70S6K, 4EBP1 but also inhibited the activation of MAPK pathway. Conclusions: Inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway suppressed the elevation of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and the angiogenic agent VEGF induced by 7-KC. The protective effect of rapamycin was associated with its downregulation on MAPK pathway.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the findings of incidental asymptomatic COVID-19 infection on FDG PET-CT using a case-control design. METHODS: Incidental pulmonary findings suspicious of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection on FDG PET-CT were classified as a confirmed (positive RT-PCR test) or suspected case (no/negative RT-PCR test). Control cases were identified using a 4:1 control:case ratio. Pulmonary findings were re-categorised by two reporters using the BSTI classification. SUV metrics in ground glass opacification (GGO)/consolidation (where present), background lung, intrathoracic nodes, liver, spleen and bone marrow were measured. RESULTS: 7/9 confirmed and 11/15 suspected cases (COVID-19 group) were re-categorised as BSTI 1 (classic/probable COVID-19) or BSTI 2 (indeterminate COVID-19); 0/96 control cases were categorised as BSTI 1. Agreement between two reporters using the BSTI classification was almost perfect (weighted kappa = 0.94). SUV(max) GGO/consolidation (5.1 vs 2.2; p < 0.0001) and target-to-background ratio, normalised to liver SUV(mean) (2.4 vs 1.0; p < 0.0001) were higher in the BSTI 1 & 2 group vs BSTI 3 (non-COVID-19) cases. SUV(max) GGO/consolidation discriminated between the BSTI 1 & 2 group vs BSTI 3 (non-COVID-19) cases with high accuracy (AUC = 0.93). SUV metrics were higher (p < 0.05) in the COVID-19 group vs control cases in the lungs, intrathoracic nodes and spleen. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection on FDG PET-CT is characterised by bilateral areas of FDG avid (intensity > x2 liver SUV(mean)) GGO/consolidation and can be identified with high interobserver agreement using the BSTI classification. There is generalised background inflammation within the lungs, intrathoracic nodes and spleen. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Incidental asymptomatic COVID-19 infection on FDG PET-CT, characterised by bilateral areas of ground glass opacification and consolidation, can be identified with high reproducibility using the BSTI classification. The intensity of associated FDG uptake (>x2 liver SUV(mean)) provides high discriminative ability in differentiating such cases from pulmonary findings in a non-COVID-19 pattern. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection causes a generalised background inflammation within the mid-lower zones of the lungs, hilar and central mediastinal nodal stations, and spleen on FDG PET-CT.",

Herein, we aimed to uncover the gene expression profiling of transcription factors (TFs) in lung cancer as well as to develop a TF-based genomic model. METHODS: We retrospectively curated lung cancer patients from public databases. Through comparing mRNA expression profiling between lung cancer and normal specimens, specific TFs were determined. Thereafter, a TF genomic model was developed with univariate Cox regression and stepwise multivariable Cox analyses, which was verified through the GSE72094 dataset. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were presented. Downstream targets of TFs were predicted with ChEA, JASPAR, and MotifMap projects, and their biological significance was investigated through the clusterProfiler algorithm. RESULTS: In the TCGA cohort, we proposed a TF-based genomic model, comprised of SATB2, HLF, and NPAS2. Lung cancer individuals were remarkably stratified into high- and low-risk groups. Survival analyses uncovered that high-risk populations presented unfavorable survival outcomes. ROCs confirmed the excellent predictive potency in patients' prognosis. Additionally, this model was an independent prognostic indicator in accordance with multivariate analyses. The clinical implication of the model was well verified in an independent dataset. High risk score was in relation to carcinogenic pathways. Downstream targets were characterized by immune and carcinogenic activation. CONCLUSION: The proposed TF genomic model acts as a promising marker for estimation of lung cancer patients' outcomes. Prospective research is required for testing the clinical utility of the model in individualized management of lung cancer.",

Despite the advancement of entrepreneurship education literature and the increasing focus on entrepreneurship education in business schools, we lack empirical exploration on how entrepreneurship education can impact students' passion for founding new organizations. We hypothesize that students who take entrepreneurship classes would develop high levels of founding passion due to a great perception of skills and abilities that increase positive emotions and decrease negative emotions about the entrepreneurship process. Moreover, we draw on the literature on role models to suggest that students' entrepreneurial family background (students whose immediate family members are entrepreneurs) strengthens the influence of entrepreneurship education on entrepreneurial passion. Utilizing survey data collected from 160 university students, we found that entrepreneurship education positively influences students' founding passion and that this relationship is strengthened when students have entrepreneurs in their immediate family.",

        "abstract": "Peptic ulcer disease affects many people globally. With the increasing resistance to some orthodox antibiotics such as Clarithromycin and Metronidazole, it is important that new acceptable, safer and effective therapies are developed to manage this disease. Various herbal medicines have been used traditionally for the remedy of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), however scientific information with regards to their anti-peptic ulcer both in-vivo and in-vitro as well as clinical studies supporting their use is still inadequate. The Centre for Plant Medicine Research, (CPMR) Mampong-Akuapem, Ghana manufactures three herbal Products namely Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK 500 capsules which are currently used for the remedy of PUD as a triple therapy at its out-patient clinic with promising effects. The aim of this review is to gather information from literature on the anti-ulcer properties, pharmacological, phytochemical constituents and related activities of herbal plants used at the CPMR for formulation of the triple herbal therapy. This review may, provide some scientific bases for the use of Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK 500 capsules in the management of Peptic ulcer at the CPMR out-patient clinic. METHODS: Organization for the review involved the on and/or offline search for information from available literature using electronic data and scientific research information resources such as PubMed, Science Direct and Google scholar. RESULTS: In this review, fifteen ethno-medicinal plants used for the formulation of Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK capsules have been discussed, presenting the description of the plants, composition and pharmacological activity. INTERPRETATION: Tables with the summary of reviewed medicinal plants with their anti-ulcer models and inference on possible mechanisms of action were drawn up. The mechanism(s) of action of individual plants and products (Enterica, Dyspepsia and NPK 500 capsules) must be further investigated and established experimentally in-vitro in addition to in-vivo pharmacological and clinical activity studies to confirm their use in the remedy of PUD.",

In this study, two series of nipagin and eugenol-derived copoly(ether ester)s, PHN1(1-x)E1(x) and PHN1(1-x)E2(x) (x = 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%), were prepared with renewable 1,6-hexanediol as a comonomer. The nipagin-derived component acts as the renewable surrogate of petroleum-based dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), while the eugenol-derived component acts as the cooperative property modifier of parent homopoly(ether ester) PHN1. 1,6-Hexanediol was chosen as the spacer because of its renewability, high boiling point, and short chain to enhance the glass transition temperatures (T(g)s) of materials. The molecular weights and chemical structures were confirmed by gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), NMR and FTIR spectroscopies. Thermal and crystalline properties were studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD). The tensile assays were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties. The results suggested that properties of this kind of poly(ether ester)s could be finely tuned by the relative content of two components for the desired applications (elastomer, rubbery) suitable for different scenarios from polyethylene glycol terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).",

Allosteric modulation of the CaS receptor corrects disorders of calcium homeostasis. Here, we report the cryogenic-electron microscopy reconstructions of a near-full-length CaS receptor in the absence and presence of allosteric modulators. Activation of the homodimeric CaS receptor requires a break in the transmembrane 6 (TM6) helix of each subunit, which facilitates the formation of a TM6-mediated homodimer interface and expansion of homodimer interactions. This transformation in TM6 occurs without a positive allosteric modulator. Two modulators with opposite functional roles bind to overlapping sites within the transmembrane domain through common interactions, acting to stabilize distinct rotamer conformations of key residues on the TM6 helix. The positive modulator reinforces TM6 distortion and maximizes subunit contact to enhance receptor activity, while the negative modulator strengthens an intact TM6 to dampen receptor function. In both active and inactive states, the receptor displays symmetrical transmembrane conformations that are consistent with its homodimeric assembly.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain with or without radicular leg pain is an extremely common health condition significantly impacting patient's activities and quality of life. When conservative management fails, epidural injections providing only temporary relief, are frequently utilized. Intradiscal oxygen-ozone may offer an alternative to epidural injections and further reduce the need for microdiscectomy. PURPOSE: To compare the non-inferiority treatment status and clinical outcomes of intradiscal oxygen-ozone with microdiscectomy in patients with refractory radicular leg pain due to single-level contained lumbar disc herniations. STUDY DESIGN / SETTING: Multicenter pilot prospective non-inferiority blocked randomized control trial conducted in three European hospital spine centers. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty-nine patients (mean 40 years of age, 17 females/32 males) with a single-level contained lumbar disc herniation, radicular leg pain for more than six weeks, and resistant to medical management were randomized, 25 to intradiscal oxygen-ozone and 24 to microdiscectomy. 88% (43 of 49) received their assigned treatment and constituted the AS-Treated (AT) population. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was overall 6-month improvement over baseline in leg pain. Other validated clinical outcomes, including back numerical rating pain scores (NRS), Roland Morris Disability Index (RMDI) and EQ-5D, were collected at baseline, 1 week, 1-, 3-, and 6-months. Procedural technical outcomes were recorded and adverse events were evaluated at all follow-up intervals. METHODS: Oxygen-ozone treatment performed as outpatient day surgeries, included a one-time intradiscal injection delivered at a concentration of 35+/-3 mug/cc of oxygen-ozone by a calibrated delivery system. Discectomies performed as open microdiscectomy inpatient surgeries, were without spinal instrumentation, and not as subtotal microdiscectomies. Primary analyses with a non-inferiority margin of -1.94-point difference in 6-month cumulative weighted mean leg pain NRS scores were conducted using As-Treated (AT) and Intent-to-Treat (ITT) populations. In post hoc analyses, differences between treatment groups in improvement over baseline were compared at each follow-up visit, using baseline leg pain as a covariate. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, the overall 6-month difference between treatment groups in leg pain improvement using the AT population was -0.31 (SE, 0.84) points in favor of microdiscectomy and using the ITT population, the difference was 0.32 (SE, 0.88) points in favor of oxygen-ozone. The difference between oxygen-ozone and microdiscectomy did not exceed the non-inferiority 95% confidence lower limit of treatment difference in either the AT (95% lower limit, -1.72) or ITT (95% lower limit, -1.13) populations. Both treatments resulted in rapid and statistically significant improvements over baseline in leg pain, back pain, RMDI, and EQ-5D that persisted in follow-up. Between group differences were not significant for any outcomes. During 6-month follow-up, 71% (17 of 24) of patients receiving oxygen-ozone, avoided microdiscectomy. The mean procedure time for oxygen-ozone was significantly faster than microdiscectomy by 58 minutes (p<.0010) and the mean discharge time from procedure was significantly shorter for the oxygen-ozone procedure (4.3+/-2.9 hours vs. 44.2+/-29.9 hours, p<.001). No major adverse events occurred in either treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Intradiscal oxygen-ozone chemonucleolysis for single-level lumbar disc herniations unresponsive to medical management, met the non-inferiority criteria to microdiscectomy on 6-month mean leg pain improvement. Both treatment groups achieved similar rapid significant clinical improvements that persisted and overall, 71% undergoing intradiscal oxygen-ozone were able to avoid surgery.",

        "abstract": "IL-15 exhibits pleiotropic effects on NK and CD8(+) T cells and contributes to host protection or immunopathology during infection. Although both type I IFNs and IFN-gamma upregulate IL-15 expression, their effects on IL-15 upregulation and underlying mechanisms have not been compared comprehensively. In addition, little is known about trans-presentation of IL-15 by epithelial cells to lymphocytes. In this study, we analyzed the expression of IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha in the human hepatocyte-derived Huh-7 cell line after stimulation with IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma using RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. We also performed knockdown experiments to investigate the signaling pathway involved in IL-15 upregulation. IFN-gamma more potently upregulated IL-15 expression in Huh-7 cells than IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. Knockdown experiments revealed that IFN-gamma- and IFN-beta-induced IL-15 expression relied on IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which is upregulated by STAT1 and IFN-stimulated gene factor 3, respectively. Inhibitor of kappaB kinase alpha/beta was also involved in IFN-gamma-induced upregulation of IL-15. Furthermore, human NK cells were activated by coculture with IFN-gamma-treated Huh-7 cells, which was abrogated by knocking down IL-15Ralpha in IFN-gamma-treated Huh-7 cells, indicating that IFN-gamma-induced IL-15 on Huh-7 cells activates NK cells via trans-presentation. In summary, our data demonstrate that IFN-gamma potently elicits IL-15 trans-presentation by epithelial cells via IRF1. These data also suggest that the IFN-gamma-IRF1-IL-15 axis may be a regulatory target for the treatment of diseases with IL-15 dysregulation.",

        "abstract": "Since the mature green tomatoes have color similar to branches and leaves, some are shaded by branches and leaves, and overlapped by other tomatoes, the accurate detection and location of these tomatoes is rather difficult. This paper proposes to use the Mask R-CNN algorithm for the detection and segmentation of mature green tomatoes. A mobile robot is designed to collect images round-the-clock and with different conditions in the whole greenhouse, thus, to make sure the captured dataset are not only objects with the interest of users. After the training process, RestNet50-FPN is selected as the backbone network. Then, the feature map is trained through the region proposal network to generate the region of interest (ROI), and the ROIAlign bilinear interpolation is used to calculate the target region, such that the corresponding region in the feature map is pooled to a fixed size based on the position coordinates of the preselection box. Finally, the detection and segmentation of mature green tomatoes is realized by the parallel actions of ROI target categories, bounding box regression and mask. When the Intersection over Union is equal to 0.5, the performance of the trained model is the best. The experimental results show that the F1-Score of bounding box and mask region all achieve 92.0%. The image acquisition processes are fully unobservable, without any user preselection, which are a highly heterogenic mix, the selected Mask R-CNN algorithm could also accurately detect mature green tomatoes. The performance of this proposed model in a real greenhouse harvesting environment is also evaluated, thus facilitating the direct application in a tomato harvesting robot.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The carotid region is encountered in vascular and neurological surgery and carries a potential for vascular and cranial nerve trauma. The carotid bifurcation is an especially important landmark and difficult to predict based on currently established landmarks. This study is a detailed analysis of the carotid region and proposes a novel methodology to predict the height of the bifurcation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Superficial and deep dissections were performed on the anterior triangle of the neck to expose the carotid region in twenty-one formalin-fixed donor cadavers. Musculoskeletal and neurovascular structures were assessed in relation to the carotid bifurcation and the medial border of the clavicle (MBC). RESULTS: The carotid bifurcation occurred, on average, 11.4 mm higher on the left (p < 0.001; 95% CI: 9.28, 13.54). The superior thyroid artery (p < 0.001), facial vein (p < 0.001), and cranial nerve XII (p < 0.001) were all more distal on the left side when measured from the MBC while the angle of the mandible and stylohyoid muscle remained symmetric. Left- and right-sided vascular structures were symmetric when measured from the carotid bifurcation. CONCLUSIONS: Neurovascular structures within the carotid region are likely to be anatomically superior on the left side while vessels are likely to remain symmetric in relation to the carotid bifurcation. When measured from the MBC, the bifurcation height can be predicted by multiplying the distance between the MBC and mastoid process by 0.65 (right side) or 0.74 (left side). This novel methodological estimation may be easily learned and directly implemented in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC), a common gynecological cancer, is characterized by a high malignant potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have been associated with the chemo- or radiotherapeutic resistance of human malignancies. Herein, the current study set out to explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-181d involved in the cisplatin (DDP) resistance of OC cells. Firstly, in-situ hybridization method was performed to identify miR-181d expression in ovarian tissues of DDP-resistant or DDP-sensitive patients. In addition, miR-181d expression in A2780 cells and A2780/DDP cell lines was determined by RT-qPCR. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were then performed to characterize the effect of miR-181d on OC cell behaviors. We probed the miR-181d affinity to OGT, as well as the downstream glycosylation of KEAP1 and ubiquitination of NRF2. Further, in vivo experiments were performed to define the role of miR-181d in tumor resistance to DDP. miR-181d was highly expressed in the ovarian tissues of DDP-resistant patients and the A2780/DDP cell line. Ectopic expression of miR-181d augmented DDP resistance in OC cells. In addition, miR-181d was found to target the 3'UTR of OGT mRNA, and negatively regulate the OGT expression. Mechanistic results indicated that OGT repressed NRF2 expression through glycosylation of KEAP1, thereby inhibiting the DDP resistance of OC cells. Furthermore, miR-181d negatively orchestrated the OGT/KEAP1/NRF2 axis to enhance the OC resistance to DDP in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest that miR-181d-mediated OGT inhibition restricts the glycosylation of KEAP1, and then reduces the ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2, leading to DDP resistance of OC. This study provides new insights for prevention and control of OC.",

We analyzed the association between circulating C5a levels and the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Serum C5a levels were determined in 32 hospitalized and 17 non-hospitalized patients from Clinica Universidad de Navarra. One hundred and eighty eight serial samples were collected during the hospitalization stay and up to three months during the follow-up. Median C5a levels were 27.71 ng/ml (25th to 75th percentile: 19.35-34.96) for samples collected during hospitalization, versus 16.76 ng/ml (12.90-25.08) for samples collected during the follow-up (p<0.001). There was a negative correlation between serum C5a levels and the number of days from symptom onset (p<0.001). C5a levels also correlated with a previously validated clinical risk score (p<0.001), and was associated with the severity of the disease (p<0.001). An overall reduction of C5a levels was observed after hospital discharge. However, elevated C5a levels persisted in those patients with high COVID-19 severity (i.e. those with a longest stay in the hospital), even after months from hospital discharge (p=0.020). Moreover, high C5a levels appeared to be associated with the presence of long-term respiratory symptoms (p=0.004). In conclusion, serum C5a levels remain high in severe cases of COVID-19, and are associated with the presence of respiratory symptoms after hospital discharge. These results may suggest a role for C5a in the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection.",

        "abstract": "Excitation energy migration via homo-FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer) is a unique variant of traditional FRET that involves a non-radiative energy transfer between the dipoles of two or more chemical identical fluorophores in close proximity and with an overlap between its excitation and emission spectra. Such energy migrations between chemically identical fluorophores within the Forster distance having their dipoles oriented over a wide angular spread results in the depolarization of fluorescence anisotropy depending on the local density of the fluorophores. Therefore, this methodology can be employed to study protein oligomerization and amyloid fibril formation. The conceptual framework involves extracting structural information by identifying proximal and distal locations in supramolecular assemblies by monitoring the efficiency of homo-FRET between fluorophore-conjugated protein molecules within these supramolecular assemblies. This review highlights two such cases in which excitation energy migration via homo-FRET was used to characterize the formation of membrane-mediated beta-sheet rich oligomers of the prion protein as well as to construct a site-specific 2D-proximity correlation map to probe inter-residue proximities within the highly organized amyloid fibrils of alpha-synuclein. Energy migration studies will find applications in studying a wide range of biomolecular assemblies such as lipid-protein complexes, oligomers, amyloids, and phase-separated condensates.",

        "abstract": "Disruptions in amygdalar function, a brain area involved in encoding emotionally salient information, has been implicated in stress-related affective disorders. Earlier animal studies on the behavioral consequences of stress-induced abnormalities in the amygdala focused on learned behaviors using fear conditioning paradigms. If and how stress affects unconditioned, innate fear responses to ethologically natural aversive stimuli remains unexplored. Hence, we subjected rats to aversive ultrasonic vocalization calls emitted on one end of a linear track. Unstressed control rats exhibited a robust avoidance response by spending more time away from the source of the playback calls. Unexpectedly, prior exposure to chronic immobilization stress prevented this avoidance reaction, rather than enhancing it. Further, this stress-induced impairment extended to other innately aversive stimuli, such as white noise and electric shock in an inhibitory avoidance task. However, conditioned fear responses were enhanced by the same stress. Inactivation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in control rats prevented this avoidance reaction evoked by the playback. Consistent with this, analysis of the immediate early gene cFos revealed higher activity in the BLA of control, but not stressed rats, after exposure to the playback. Further, in vivo recordings in freely behaving control rats exposed to playback showed enhanced theta activity in the BLA, which also was absent in stressed rats. These findings offer a new framework for studying stress-induced alterations in amygdala-dependent maladaptive responses to more naturally threatening and emotionally relevant social stimuli. The divergent impact of stress on defensive responses--impaired avoidance responses together with increased conditioned fear--also has important implications for models of learned helplessness and depression.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of inhalational aromatherapy in the care of hospitalized pediatric patients. METHODS: Systematic review of clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies, based on PRISMA recommendations, searching Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, SciELO, LILACS, CINAHL, Science Direct, EBSCO, and updated databases. The Down and Black 2020, RoB 2020 CLARITY, and ROBINS-I 2020 scales were used through the Distiller SR software to verify the studies' internal validity and risk of bias. RESULTS: From 446 articles identified, 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seven were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one pilot RCT, and one non-randomized quasi-experimental trial. Different outcomes were analyzed, with pain being the most frequently measured variable. None of the 6 studies that evaluated pain showed significant effects with inhalation aromatherapy. Additionally, non-significant effects were found regarding nausea, vomiting, and behavioral/emotional variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are still inconclusive, and more evidence is required from future studies with high methodological quality, blinding, and adequate sample sizes.",

AIMS: To find the pneumococcal carriage rate, resistance, serotypes, and coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) among infants in the first six months of age in the period from March 2008 to April 2016. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) were taken from healthy infants from the northern part of Jordan. Swabs were processed for cultivation, identification, resistance testing and serotyping according to standard methods. RESULTS: During the surveillance period, 484 infants of this age group were tested, with a total carriage rate of 56.2%. 96.2% of infants one to two months of age got one PCV7 injection and were 58% carriers at the time of the first injection. At age three to four months, 84.9% had received two injections, with a carriage rate of 54.9% at the time of the second injection. At ages five to six months, 12.5% had received one to three injections, with a carriage rate of 43.8%. Predominant serotypes in all age groups were 19F (12.5%), 6A (11.4%), 11A (8.4%), 19A (7.0%), 6B (6.6%), 23F (5.9%), 15B (5.1%), 15A and 23A (4.0% each). Coverage of PCV7, PCV13 and the future PCV20 among all cases were 30.5%, 50.7% and 70.6%, respectively. The highest coverage rate of 78.6% was noticed in the age group at five to six months with the future PCV20. Antibiotic resistance was the highest in the first age group. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal carriage starts from the first month of the infant's life. The highest coverage was noticed for PCV20, which implies the necessity for inoculation with future vaccines.",

Compared with lung cancer patients who have more widespread disease, oligometastatic lung cancer patients have more favorable survival outcomes. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that local ablative therapy (LAT) directed at the metastatic deposits in addition to standard-of-care systemic therapy may further improve survival outcomes in oligometastatic lung cancer patients. One LAT modality that has been utilized in oligometastatic lung cancer is radiation therapy. In particular, ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy, also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), has been shown to provide excellent local control with a favorable safety profile. Here, we reviewed the retrospective studies and prospective trials that have deployed radiation therapy as LAT in oligometastatic lung cancer, including randomized studies showing benefits for progression-free survival and overall survival with the addition of LAT. We also discuss the impact of targeted therapies and immunotherapy on radiation as LAT.",

In drug cytotoxicity assessments, MCTs provide better mimicry of conventional solid tumors that can precisely represent anticancer drug candidates' effects. To generate incubate multicellular spheroids, researchers have developed several 3D multicellular spheroid culture technologies to establish a research background and a platform using tumor modelingvia advanced materials science, and biosensing techniques for drug-screening. In application, drug screening was performed in both invasive and non-invasive manners, according to their impact on the spheroids.

Here, we use high-resolution satellite land surface temperatures (LSTs) and land-cover data from 293 European cities to infer the potential of urban trees to reduce LSTs. We show that urban trees exhibit lower temperatures than urban fabric across most European cities in summer and during hot extremes. Compared to continuous urban fabric, LSTs observed for urban trees are on average 0-4 K lower in Southern European regions and 8-12 K lower in Central Europe. Treeless urban green spaces are overall less effective in reducing LSTs, and their cooling effect is approximately 2-4 times lower than the cooling induced by urban trees. By revealing continental-scale patterns in the effect of trees and treeless green spaces on urban LST our results highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the climate-dependent effectiveness of heat mitigation measures in cities.",

In the current study, we have developed a smart nano-transforming hydrogel (NTG) that transforms in situ to polymeric nanoparticles (PA NPs) of 100-150 nm when injected subcutaneously. These nanoparticles targeted the primary and secondary metastatic tumors for up to  approximately 5 and  approximately 3 days, respectively. The in situ-formed PA NPs also demonstrated a pH-responsive drug release resulting in about  approximately 80% release within 100 h at 5.8 pH.

        "abstract": "Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is a major cause of drug resistance in fungal pathogens. Milbemycins, enniatin B, beauvericin, and FK506 are promising leads for broad-spectrum fungal multidrug efflux pump inhibitors. The characterization of naturally generated inhibitor-resistant mutants is a powerful tool to elucidate structure-activity relationships in ABC transporters. We isolated 20 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants overexpressing Candida albicans ABC pump Cdr1 variants resistant to fluconazole efflux inhibition by milbemycin alpha25 (8 mutants), enniatin B (8), or beauvericin (4). The 20 mutations were in just 9 residues at the centers of transmembrane segment 1 (TMS1) (6 mutations), TMS4 (4), TMS5 (4), TMS8 (1), and TMS11 (2) and in A713P (3), a previously reported FK506-resistant \"hot spot 1\" mutation in extracellular loop 3. Six Cdr1-G521S/C/V/R (TMS1) variants were resistant to all four inhibitors, four Cdr1-M639I (TMS4) variants were resistant to milbemycin alpha25 and enniatin B, and two Cdr1-V668I/D (TMS5) variants were resistant to enniatin B and beauvericin. The eight milbemycin alpha25-resistant mutants were altered in four amino acids as follows: G521R, M639I, A713P, and T1355N (TMS11). These four Cdr1 variants responded differently to various types of inhibitors, and each exhibited altered substrate specificity and kinetic properties. The data infer an entry gate function for Cdr1-G521 and a role for Cdr1-A713 in the constitutively high Cdr1 ATPase activity. Cdr1-M639I and -T1355N possibly cause inhibitor resistance by altering TMS contacts near the substrate/inhibitor-binding pocket. Models for the interactions of substrates and different types of inhibitors with Cdr1 at various stages of the transport cycle are presented.",

The results indicate that the fracture is located at the advancing side of the thermomechanically affected zone (AS-TMAZ) and the stir zone (SZ) interface. The AS-TMAZ microstructure is vastly different from the microstructure and texture of other areas. The grain orientation is disordered, and the grain shape is seriously deformed under the action of stirring force. The grain size grows unevenly under the input of friction heat, resulting in a large amount of recrystallization, and there is a significant difference in the Taylor factor between adjacent grains and the AS-TMAZ-SZ interface. On the contrary, there are fine and uniform equiaxed grains in the nugget zone, the microstructure is uniform, and the Taylor factor is small at adjacent grains. Therefore, the uneven transition of microstructure and texture in the AS-TMAZ and the SZ provide conditions for crack initiation, which become the weak point of mechanical properties.",

We experienced a case of cutaneous metastasis that emerged during chemotherapy and progressed rapidly during immunotherapy for bladder tumor with lymph node metastasis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old female patient received chemotherapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin for bladder urothelial carcinoma with para-aortic and pelvic lymph node metastases (clinical stage T2N1M1). After eight courses of chemotherapy, skin rash appeared in the lower abdomen with leg edema caused by multiple lymphadenopathy. Skin biopsy revealed cutaneous metastasis of urothelial carcinoma. The cutaneous tumor progressed rapidly and the patient died 5 weeks after the start of second-line pembrolizumab treatment. CONCLUSION: A patient with cutaneous metastasis of urothelial carcinoma that emerged during chemotherapy had poor prognosis and lack of efficacy of an immune checkpoint inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "The first human corneal transplantation was performed in 1905 by Eduard Zirm in the Olomouc Eye Clinic, now Czech Republic. However, despite great advancements in microsurgical eye procedures, penetrating keratoplasty in high-risk patients (e.g., vascularized or inflamed corneal tissue, consecutive transplants) remains a challenge. The difficulty is mainly due to the risk of irreversible allograft rejection, as an ocular immune privilege in these patients is abolished and graft rejection is the main cause of corneal graft failure. Therefore, tailored immunosuppressive treatment based on immunological monitoring [e.g., donor-specific antibodies (DSA)] is considered one of the best strategies to prevent rejection in transplant recipients. Although there is indirect evidence on the mechanisms underlying antibody-mediated rejection, the impact of DSA on cornea transplantation remains unknown. Determining the role of pre-existing and/or de novo DSA could advance our understanding of corneal graft rejection mechanisms. This may help stratify the immunological risk of rejection, ultimately leading to personalized treatment for this group of transplant recipients.",

The involvement of more than one valve may imply more severe and extensive cardiac lesions. In these patients, surgery may be challenging. We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics, the therapeutic strategy, and the prognostic impact of double-valve IE (DVIE). We retrospectively included in the analysis that 440 consecutive patients with definite active IE in a single surgical centre. DVIE occurred in 75 of the total enrolled 440 patients (17%) and involved mostly the combination of mitral and aortic valves (N = 63, 84%). Most patients had double-native IE (N = 45, 60%). Staphylococci were less frequent in patients with double-valve than single-valve IE (SVIE). The proportion of patients undergoing valve repair among those treated surgically was higher for patients with DVIE than for SVIE (p < 0.03). Valve repair of at least one valve was associated with non-significant better survival than double replacement. DVIE was associated with higher all-cause mortality than SVIE (p < 0.013) and a higher relapse rate (p = 0.023). DVIE was not associated with a higher risk of composite non-fatal adverse events. DVIE represents a considerable proportion of overall cases of IE, mainly involving aortic and mitral valves, with a jet lesion on the mitral valve; Staphylococcus is significantly less frequent than in SVIE; DVIE is independently associated with higher mortality and relapse rate; finally, mitral valve repair is feasible in a considerable proportion of surgical cases.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal injections (CHIs) in conjunction with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOBC) for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 electronic databases for related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to April 30, 2021. The quality of each trial was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, the differences in effectiveness and safety outcomes between two groups were evaluated, and the results were expressed as the risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed according to the types of CHIs, and Review Manager 5 was used to statistically analyze the outcomes. Results: 63 studies involving 9 CHIs and 4733 patients were included in this review. The meta-analysis results suggested that compared with FOBC therapy, CHIs plus FOBC therapy showed significant improvements in objective response rate (ORR) (RR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.27-1.42, P<0.00001), disease control rate (DCR) (RR=1.09, 95%CI: 1.06-1.11, P<0.00001), 1-year survival rate (RR=2.27, 95% CI: 1.23-4.18, P=0.009) and quality of life (QoL) (RR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.14-1.28, P<0.00001), and decreases in the incidence of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.50-0.82, P<0.0005), nausea and vomiting (RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.51-0.83, P=0.0005) and diarrhea (RR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.20-0.58, P<0.0001). Conclusion: From the evidence available, CHIs could increase ORR, DCR and 1-year survival rate, improve QoL and relieve chemotherapy-induced leukopenia, nausea and vomiting and diarrhea when combined with FOBC in advanced CRC treatment, Nevertheless, on account of the limitations, more rigorous RCTs with high-quality methodology were needed to further confirm the results.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the demographic and corneal factors associated with the occurrence of delayed reepithelialization (DRE) after epithelium-off crosslinking (epi-off CXL). Design:Retrospective case series. Methods:A chart review was performed to identify patients treated with epi-off CXL. DRE was defined as a corneal epithelial defect detected by fluorescein staining that persisted for more than 10 days. Slit-lamp examination, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, corneal topography, and corneal in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were always performed preoperatively and at each follow-up visit (1, 3, 6, 12 months). A generalized estimating equation was used to assess the baseline factors associated with DRE. Results:Data from 153 eyes were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 24.9 +/- 8.5 years, and 47 (30.7%) were women. The average reepithelization time was 4.7 +/- 1.8 days. Six eyes (3.9%) experienced DRE. In the multivariate model, both the age of the patient (OR = 1.30; p = 0.02) and the corneal steepest meridian (OR = 0.44, p = 0.047) were associated with DRE. Baseline nerve count was also associated with DRE (0.87, p = 0.03). Male gender was associated with a slower early nerve regrowth (1-6 months) (p = 0.048), but not with the occurrence of DRE (p = 0.27). Preoperative central corneal thickness was not related to DRE (p = 0.16). DRE was not associated with keratoconus progression after epi-off CXL (p = 0.520). Conclusions:The association between DRE and age may reflect the age-related decrease in the corneal healing response. Also, low baseline corneal nerve count is associated with DRE. Gender seems to affect reinnervation measured by IVCM but not the reepithelization time. DRE does not seem to affect the efficacy of epi-off CXL.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study explored social and behavioural factors associated with a home fortification of complementary foods program among families of undernourished children in 14 rural communities in Honduras. DESIGN: We collected and analysed survey data from a convenience sample of 196 households participating in a nutritional program using home fortification of complementary foods in 2017. The program supplied families with a soy-based atole powder fortified with micronutrients. A research team completed a face-to-face survey exploring social and behavioural factors associated with nutritional supplement use. Anthropometric measurements for participating children were abstracted from health clinic records of previous quarterly appointments. SETTING: The study took place in San Jose del Negrito, Honduras. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were parents or guardians of children enrolled in the nutrition program. RESULTS: Nearly half of participant families shared the nutritional supplement with other family members besides the index child, while 10 % reported using the supplement as a meal replacement for the child. Low education level of mothers was associated with improper use of the supplement (P = 0.005). Poorer families were more likely to share the supplement (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the challenges of programs using home fortification of complementary foods in the context of food scarcity. Findings highlight the importance of increasing rural children's overall caloric intake, perhaps by increasing access to locally available protein sources. Results also suggest transitioning nutritional programs to family-based interventions to increase overall intended compliance to nutrition programming.",

Nonetheless, little is known regarding the unique presentation of ASD symptoms in DS. The current study aims to explore the prevalence and profiles of ASD symptoms in a sample of individuals with DS (n = 83), aged between 6 and 23 years. Analysis of this sample (M(Age) = 15.13) revealed that approximately 37% of the sample met the classification cut-off for ASD using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) Calibrated Severity Score (CSS), an indicator of the participants' severity of ASD-related symptoms. Item-level analyses revealed that multiple items on Module 2 and Module 3 of the ADOS-2, mostly in the Social Affect (SA) subdomain, differentiated the children with DS who did not meet ASD classification (DS-only) from those who did (DS + ASD). Lastly, comparisons of individuals with DS-only and those with DS + ASD differed significantly on the syntactic complexity of their expressive language. These findings shed light on the unique presentation of ASD symptoms in a sample of individuals with DS and suggest that expressive language abilities may play a pivotal role in the presentation of ASD symptoms in DS.",

The thinning intensity of 20% had a limited effect on promoting the radial growth recovery of high-density forest (1900 trees.hm(-2)), but had a significant effect on medium-density forest (1600 trees.hm(-2)). The radial growth of Q. mongolica was sensitive to the precipitation changes in January and February of the current year. Thinning reduced the sensitivity of Q. mongolica radial growth to climate. Under scenarios of climate warming and drying, density regulation could be beneficial in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on the growth of Q. mongolica.",

        "abstract": "The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model version 5.3 (CMAQ53), released to the public in August 2019 and followed by version 5.3.1 (CMAQ531) in December 2019, contains numerous science updates, enhanced functionality, and improved computation efficiency relative to the previous version of the model, 5.2.1 (CMAQ521). Major science advances in the new model include a new aerosol module (AERO7) with significant updates to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) chemistry, updated chlorine chemistry, updated detailed bromine and iodine chemistry, updated simple halogen chemistry, the addition of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) chemistry in the CB6r3 chemical mechanism, updated M3Dry bidirectional deposition model, and the new Surface Tiled Aerosol and Gaseous Exchange (STAGE) bidirectional deposition model. In addition, support for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model's hybrid vertical coordinate (HVC) was added to CMAQ53 and the Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP) version 5.0 (MCIP50). Enhanced functionality in CMAQ53 includes the new Detailed Emissions Scaling, Isolation and Diagnostic (DESID) system for scaling incoming emissions to CMAQ and reading multiple gridded input emission files. Evaluation of CMAQ531 was performed by comparing monthly and seasonal mean daily 8 h average (MDA8) O(3) and daily PM(2.5) values from several CMAQ531 simulations to a similarly configured CMAQ521 simulation encompassing 2016. For MDA8 O(3), CMAQ531 has higher O(3) in the winter versus CMAQ521, due primarily to reduced dry deposition to snow, which strongly reduces wintertime O(3) bias (2-4 ppbv monthly average). MDA8 O(3) is lower with CMAQ531 throughout the rest of the year, particularly in spring, due in part to reduced O(3) from the lateral boundary conditions (BCs), which generally increases MDA8 O(3) bias in spring and fall ( 0.5 mug m(-3)). For daily 24 h average PM(2.5), CMAQ531 has lower concentrations on average in spring and fall, higher concentrations in summer, and similar concentrations in winter to CMAQ521, which slightly increases bias in spring and fall and reduces bias in summer. Comparisons were also performed to isolate updates to several specific aspects of the modeling system, namely the lateral BCs, meteorology model version, and the deposition model used. Transitioning from a hemispheric CMAQ (HCMAQ) version 5.2.1 simulation to a HCMAQ version 5.3 simulation to provide lateral BCs contributes to higher O(3) mixing ratios in the regional CMAQ simulation in higher latitudes during winter (due to the decreased O(3) dry deposition to snow in CMAQ53) and lower O(3) mixing ratios in middle and lower latitudes year-round (due to reduced O(3) over the ocean with CMAQ53). Transitioning from WRF version 3.8 to WRF version 4.1.1 with the HVC resulted in consistently higher (1.0-1.5 ppbv) MDA8 O(3) mixing ratios and higher PM(2.5) concentrations (0.1-0.25 mug m(-3)) throughout the year. Finally, comparisons of the M3Dry and STAGE deposition models showed that MDA8 O(3) is generally higher with M3Dry outside of summer, while PM(2.5) is consistently higher with STAGE due to differences in the assumptions of particle deposition velocities to non-vegetated surfaces and land use with short vegetation (e.g., grasslands) between the two models. For ambient NH(3), STAGE has slightly higher concentrations and smaller bias in the winter, spring, and fall, while M3Dry has higher concentrations and smaller bias but larger error and lower correlation in the summer.",

        "abstract": "A global transformation towards sustainable food systems is crucial for delivering on climate change mitigation targets worldwide. In high- and middle-income settings, plant-based meat and dairy alternatives present potential substitutes for animal sourced foods, and a pathway to transition to more sustainable diets. We examined plant-based alternative foods (PBAF) consumption trends in the UK by analysing repeated cross-sectional food consumption data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008-2019. Dietary data for 15,655 individuals aged 1.5 years and over were analysed to assess aggregate change in intake of PBAF and six other food groups that play a role in transformative dietary change. Characteristics associated with consumption of PBAF were explored using logistic regression, and consumption patterns in high and low meat consumers were explored by examining intake of potential animal product substitute food groups. The proportion of individuals reporting consumption of any PBAFs increased from 6.7% in 2008-2011, to 13.1% in 2017-2019 (p < 0.01). Compared to 2008-2011 PBAF consumption rose by 115% in 2017-2019 (p < 0.01). Females were 46% more likely than males to report consumption of PBAF (p < 0.01). Millennials (age 24-39 years) were the most likely generation to report PBAF consumption (p < 0.01 compared to generation Z (age 11-23 years) and traditionalists (age 75+ years)), as were individuals of the highest income tertile (p < 0.01). Among \"low meat consumers\", PBAF consumption was on average higher than \"high meat consumers\" (18.6 g versus 4.8 g PBAF per day, p < 0.01). Our results support the hypothesis of a pivotal role of PBAF in the transition towards sustainable food systems in the UK, by demonstrating they are becoming increasingly popular among UK consumers. This highlights the urgent need to assess in detail the environmental and health impacts of large scale and population-wide consumption of PBAF in comparison to their animal-based equivalents.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional plate osteosynthesis is a valuable treatment option in displaced proximal and/or middle one-third humeral shaft fractures. Nonetheless, this procedure can be complicated by a radial nerve palsy. To date, many surgical techniques have been developed in an attempt to minimize this high-impact complication. A helical plate has the potential to avoid an iatrogenic radial nerve palsy due to its design. This article aims to evaluate safety and functional outcomes of patients treated with a helical plate compared to conventional plate osteosynthesis. In particular healing rates, complications and functional outcome measures. METHODS: We retrospectively included all patients with displaced proximal and/or middle one-third humeral shaft fractures who were treated with a helical plate from October 2016 until August 2018 at a single level-1 trauma center (AZ Groeninge, Kortrijk, Belgium). A self-molded long PHILOS plate (DePuy Synthes(R)) or a pre-contoured A.L.P.S proximal humeral plating system (Zimmer Biomet(R)) were used. Patient baseline characteristics and standard radiographs were obtained pre- and postoperatively. We retrospectively searched for complications. Patients were reassessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Constant Murley (CMS) and EQ-5D-5L scores with a minimal follow-up of 1 year. RESULTS: The humeral shaft fractures of all sixteen patients consolidated within 3 months and no iatrogenic radial nerve palsies were observed. One plate had to be removed after 1 year due to a late deep infection. With a minimum follow up of 1 year, the mean DASH score was 22 +/- 19 and the mean normalized CMS was 80 +/- 19. CONCLUSION: Operative treatment of proximal and/or middle one-third humeral shaft fractures with a helical plate is a safe procedure with good to excellent shoulder function at one-year follow-up. Contrary to conventional plate osteosynthesis, a helical plate has the potential to completely avoid a radial nerve palsy, while maintaining similar healing rates and functional outcomes.

        "abstract": "TNBG-5602, a new synthesized derivative of tetrazanbigen, is a potential chemotherapeutic agent against cancer. However, its underlying mechanism is complex and still unknown. In this investigation, the anticancer effects of TNBG-5602 were determined in vitro and in vivo. Small RNA retroviral library plasmids that overexpress 19-bp fragments were used to generate TNBG-5602-resistant cells. After validation, the overexpressed 19-bp fragments were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, the relationship of TNBG-5602, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on Chromosome 10 (PTEN), and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway was explored. The results showed that TNBG-5602 can effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Drug-resistant cells were screened using the small RNA library. Compared with naive cells, drug-resistant cells were more resistant to TNBG-5602 in vitro and in vivo. NGS results revealed that the second highest overexpressed 19-bp fragment perfectly matched the PTEN gene, so the expression of PTEN in various cells and tissues was verified. Further research showed that exogenous overexpression of PTEN strengthened the anticancer effects of TNBG-5602 on p-Akt expression, whereas silencing of PTEN weakened these effects in naive cells. Taken together, by using this library, we confirmed that PTEN is the target gene to the anticancer effects of TNBG-5602 via the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

Data on progression of extensive GIM to GC in the USA are limited. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and progression rates of extensive GIM in a US cohort. METHODS: This retrospective study assessed the prevalence of extensive GIM between 1/1/1990 and 8/1/2019 at a large academic medical center. Multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of extensive GIM. Incidence of GC on follow-up was calculated as number of new diagnoses divided by person-years of follow-up. Presence of GIM on subsequent follow-up endoscopy was assessed. RESULTS: Of 1256 individuals with GIM, 352 (28%) had extensive GIM and 904 (72%) had limited GIM. On multivariable analysis, older age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.11-2.16) were predictive of extensive GIM. The annual incidence of GC for GIM overall was 0.09%. There was no difference in progression to GC between extensive or limited GIM (IRR 0, 95% CI 0-2.6), or to advanced lesions overall (IRR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04-1.62). 70% of individuals had persistent GIM on follow-up biopsy, and 22% with limited GIM had extensive GIM on follow-up biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: 28% of individuals with GIM have the extensive subtype, and are more likely to be older and of Hispanic ethnicity. There was no difference in progression to GC between extensive and limited GIM. Further research is needed to better assess risk of GIM in the US context.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect a biomechanical database of push/pull strengths for initiating the development of a human-centered design of equipment that is not available for the intended user group, i.e. Nagaland. METHODS: The sample consisted of 399 male and 271 female agricultural workers from the five districts of Nagaland, aged 18 to 65 years, classified into three age groups. In the process of push and pull force measurements, the elbow angle of the participants were set to 30-120 degrees , 120-130 degrees , and 130-180 degrees . All tests were performed in triplicates with a resting period of two minutes between every consequent recording. RESULTS: The results showed that isometric push and pull strength values (Mean+/-SD) for males were 18.91+/-4.67 kg and 17.98+/-3.97 kg respectively and 13.07+/-4.06 kg and 11.98+/-3.33 kg for females respectively. The results of independent samples from student's t-test demonstrate that there was a substantial variance in the isometric push and pull strength values (p < 0.05) between the genders across the various age spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: With ageing, muscular strength for push-pull strength in males and females reduce. The study reports that the recommended value of male and female isometric push-pull strength for agricultural workers of Nagaland should be 5th percentile of female data i.e. 6.40 and 1.71 kg respectively.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized comparative, double-blind study was conducted on participants aged 12-18 years with acanthosis nigricans of the neck. Treatment efficacy was assessed via narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer, while the overall success rates at weeks 2, 4, and 8 were evaluated by the investigator- and participant-assessed global evaluation scales. RESULTS: A total of 40 participants with acanthosis nigricans were enrolled and completed the study. Throughout the period of 8 weeks of treatment, 20% urea showed greater improvement of hyperpigmentation compared to 10% urea (p = 0.001), with 22.5 +/- 11.9% and 10.7 +/- 8.1% improvements, respectively. Findings from the overall global evaluation scales were consistent with the results from the narrowband reflectance spectrophotometer. Treatment with 10% urea and 20% urea was well-tolerated without any local serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Urea cream improves neck hyperpigmentation associated with acanthosis nigricans in adolescents, in which the 20% concentration shows superior efficacy to the 10% concentration.",

Many studies have focused on modifying exosome surface proteins to allow drugs to specifically target cancer cells. Methods: In this study, human cord blood mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes were used in the delivery of anti-miRNA oligonucleotides so as to be specifically ingested by tumor cells to perform anti-tumor functions. Mesenchymal stem cells modified by the fusion gene iRGD-Lamp2b were constructed to separate and purify exosomes, and the anti-miRNA-221 oligonucleotide (AMO) was loaded into the exosomes by electroporation. Results: The AMO-loaded exosomes (AMO-Exos) effectively inhibited the proliferation and clonal formation of colon cancer cells in vitro, and it was further found that AMO-Exos was taken up by tumor cells through interaction with the NRP-1 protein. The results of a xenograft tumor model also showed that iRGD-modified exosomes were obviously enriched in tumor sites, exerting excellent anti-tumor efficacy. In vivo imaging showed that exosomes were mainly distributed in liver, spleen, and lung tissues. Conclusion: Our results suggest that genetically modified exosomes could be an ideal natural nanostructure for anti-miRNA oligonucleotide delivery.",

This may lead to a poor notification of diseases whose diagnosis is predominantly clinical. Aim: To evaluate and to compare the frequency of oral and maxillofacial lesions in children and adolescents in two different types of services: Oral Medicine clinic service and laboratory service. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of patients </= 19 years attending the Oral Medicine clinic service and records from the laboratory service in Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology of the Dental School of a university were analyzed. RESULTS: 828 records from the Oral Medicine clinic service and 2,409 records from the laboratory service were analyzed. The most common lesion group in both services was inflammatory/reactive lesions; however, infectious lesions and variations of normality were more frequently in the clinical service. Mucocele was the most common lesion in both services. The lips (28.9%) were the most affected region in the clinical service, while in the laboratory service, the bones (34.7%) were the most affected region. CONCLUSIONS: Some differences may occur with respect to the frequency of oral and maxillofacial lesions among pediatric individuals when data from different sources are compared.

        "abstract": "With the coming of the era of the aging population, hypertension has become a global health burden to be dealt with. Although there are multiple drugs and procedures to control the symptoms of hypertension, the management of it is still a long-term process, and the side effects of conventional drugs pose a burden on patients. Flavonoids, common compounds found in fruits and vegetables as secondary metabolites, are active components in Chinese Herbal Medicine. The flavonoids are proved to have cardiovascular benefits based on a plethora of animal experiments over the last decade. Thus, the flavonoids or flavonoid-rich plant extracts endowed with anti-hypertension activities and probable mechanisms were reviewed. It has been found that flavonoids may affect blood pressure in various ways. Moreover, despite the substantial evidence of the potential for flavonoids in the control of hypertension, it is not sufficient to support the clinical application of flavonoids as an adjuvant or core drug. So the synergistic effects of flavonoids with other drugs, pharmacokinetic studies, clinical trials and the safety of flavonoids are also incorporated in the discussion. It is believed that more breakthrough studies are needed. Overall, this review may shed some new light on the explicit recognition of the mechanisms of anti-hypertension actions of flavonoids, pointing out the limitations of relevant research at the current stage and the aspects that should be strengthened in future researches.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients (F/M, 43/45; Mean age +/- SD, 57.86 +/- 1.78 years) were included. The results of serum Nidogen-2 levels were shown with respect to stage, gender, age, and metastasis. Nidogen-2 levels in the sera of colon cancer patients and healthy donors were analyzed with ELISA. RESULTS: The expression levels were significantly higher in patients (1010.8 +/-184.36 pg/mL) than in healthy subjects (51.85 +/- 1.44 pg/mL; p<0.001). Moreover, the Nidogen-2 expression significantly increased in the clinical stages of colon cancer (p<0.01). The Nidogen-2 levels did not vary by patient age or gender. DISCUSSION: Under normal conditions, Nidogen-2 is a basal membrane protein. Nidogen-2 is primarily expressed in the extracellular matrix. Nidogen-2 has been defined as a major means to analyze the molecular pathways involved in cancer development and progression. Besides its important functions, it has been hypothesized that secreted Nidogen-2 may be a diagnostic biomarker for cancer detection. CONLUSION: These findings suggest that increased expression of Nidogen-2 may have great pathological importance in the development of colon cancer and may also show a diagnostic value for colon cancer.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pregnant veterans are a subpopulation known to be at elevated risk of developing mental health symptoms, such as depression and suicidal ideation. Inflammation has been associated with depression, specifically during the perinatal period. Critical changes in estradiol, cortisol, and inflammatory cytokines are necessary for the progression of a healthy pregnancy, which are then rapidly altered in the postpartum period. We explored changes in estradiol, cortisol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines relative to depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts across pregnancy and postpartum in this pilot and feasibility study. METHODS: We measured estradiol, cortisol, and the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in 18 pregnant veterans and analyzed the data using descriptive statistics, dependent t-tests, and correlation analyses. We assessed depression severity with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and suicidality with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Thirteen of the women repeated assessments in the early postpartum period at an average of 6.7 weeks after birth. RESULTS: As anticipated, estradiol (t(12) \u200b= \u200b12.47, p \u200b< \u200b.001) and cortisol (t(12) \u200b= \u200b9.43, p \u200b< \u200b.001) significantly decreased from pregnancy to postpartum. There were no differences in the means of gestational and postpartum IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IFN-gamma, but IL-8 was significantly increased from pregnancy to postpartum (t(12) \u200b= \u200b-4.60, p \u200b= \u200b.001). Estradiol during pregnancy was positively correlated with IL-6 levels both during pregnancy (r (p)  \u200b= \u200b.656, p \u200b= \u200b.008) and postpartum (r \u200b= \u200b0.648, p \u200b= \u200b.023). Elevated IL-1beta was associated with suicidal thoughts during pregnancy (r \u200b= \u200b0.529, p \u200b= \u200b.029). Although not statistically significant, depressive symptom severity trended towards a positive association with larger increases in IL-1beta (r \u200b= \u200b0.535, p \u200b= \u200b.09) and TNF-alpha (r \u200b= \u200b0.501, p \u200b= \u200b.08) from pregnancy to postpartum. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests the feasibility of our approach for exploring a complex interplay between hormonal and pro-inflammatory changes from pregnancy to postpartum, and their relationship with depressive symptoms. Given our small sample and the relatively exploratory nature of our analyses, additional investigation focusing on hormonal and inflammatory changes and their potential associations with perinatal mental health is necessary to confirm and extend our preliminary findings and examine additional potential covariates.",

        "abstract": "The IL-17 family is structurally distinct from other cytokine subclasses. IL-17A and IL-17F, the most closely related of this family, form homodimers and an IL-17AF heterodimer. While IL-17A and IL-17F exhibit similar activities in many settings, in others their functions are divergent. To better understand the function of IL-17F in vivo, we created mice harboring a mutation in Il17f originally described in humans with unexplained chronic mucosal candidiasis (Ser-65-Leu). We evaluated Il17f(S65L/S65L) mice in DSS-colitis, as this is one of the few settings where IL-17A and IL-17F exhibit opposing activities. Specifically, IL-17A is protective of the gut epithelium, a finding that was revealed when trials of anti-IL-17A biologics in Crohn's disease failed and recapitulated in many mouse models of colitis. In contrast, mice lacking IL-17F are resistant to DSS-colitis, partly attributable to alterations in intestinal microbiota that mobilize Tregs. Here we report that Il17f(S65L/S65L) mice do not phenocopy Il17f(-/-) mice in DSS colitis, but rather exhibited a worsening disease phenotype much like Il17a(-/-) mice. Gut inflammation in Il17f(S65L/S65L) mice correlated with reduced Treg accumulation and lowered intestinal levels of Clostridium cluster XIV. Unexpectedly, the protective DSS-colitis phenotype in Il17f(-/-) mice could be reversed upon co-housing with Il17f(S65L/S65L) mice, also correlating with Clostridium cluster XIV levels in gut. Thus, the Il17f(S65L/S65L) phenotype resembles an IL-17A deficiency more closely than IL-17F deficiency in the setting of DSS colitis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Gouqi-wentang formula (GQWTF) is a herbal formula used by Academician Xiao-lin Tong for the clinical treatment of T2DM. GQWTF is beneficial to qi, nourishes Yin, clears heat, and promotes fluid production, but the effective components and their mechanism of action remain unclear. METHODS: The main components of GQWTF were detected by LC-MS, and the multi-target mechanisms of GQWTF in T2DM were elucidated using network pharmacology analysis, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction network construction and analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation, and other network construction. Finally, the efficacy of the GQWTF was verified using biological experiments. RESULTS: First, the \"herb-channel tropism\" network suggested that GQWTF focuses more on treating diseases by recuperating the liver, which is considered as an important insulin-sensitive organ. Subsequently, a total of 16 active ingredients in GQWTF were detected and screened, and their biological targets were predicted. Then, \"compound-target\" network was constructed, where enrichment analysis of GQWTF targets reflected its potential pharmacological activities. After T2DM-related target identification, 39 cross targets of GQWTF and T2DM were obtained, and 30 key targets highly responsible for the beneficial effect of GQWTF on T2DM were identified by PPI analysis. GO analysis of these key targets showed that many biological processes of GQWTF in treating T2DM are key in the occurrence and development of T2DM, including components related to inflammatory/immune response, insulin, and metabolism. KEGG analysis revealed the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, such as insulin resistance, PPAR signalling pathway, FoxO signalling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signalling pathway, and pathways that influence diabetes primarily by regulating metabolism as well as other T2DM directly related pathways. Furthermore, a \"formula-compound-pathway-symptom\" network was constructed to represent a global view of GQWTF in the treatment of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored the mechanism of action of GQWTF in T2DM by multi-component and multi-target multi pathways, which could provide a theoretical basis for the development and clinical application of GQWTF.",

An intratesticular injection of a magnetic fluid composed of manganese-ferrite nanoparticles functionalized with citrate was administered followed by testicle exposure to an alternate magnetic field to generate localized heat. Testicular MNH was highly effective, causing progressive seminiferous tubule degeneration followed by substitution of the parenchyma with stromal tissue and gonadal atrophy, suggesting an irreversible process with few side effects to general animal health.",

Although the inflammatory storm has been considered the main pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, hypersensitivity may be another important mechanism involved in severe cases, which have a perfect response to corticosteroids (CS). METHOD: We detected the serum level of anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike S1 protein-specific IgE (SP-IgE) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific IgE (NP-IgE) in COVID-19. Correlation of levels of specific IgE and clinical severity were analysed. Pulmonary function test and bronchial provocation test were conducted in early convalescence of COVID-19. We also obtained histological samples via endoscopy to detect the evidence of mast cell activation. RESULT: The levels of serum SP-IgE and NP-IgE were significantly higher in severe cases, and were correlated with the total lung severity scores (TLSS) and the PaO(2) /FiO(2) ratio. Nucleocapsid protein could be detected in both airway and intestinal tissues, which was stained positive together with activated mast cells, binded with IgE. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) exists in the early convalescence of COVID-19. After the application of CS in severe COVID-19, SP-IgE and NP-IgE decreased, but maintained at a high level.

The host was synthesized by joining two pieces of bent anthracene dimer through amide bond formation, affording a deep hydrophobic cavity and inward-directing hydrogen bonding sites. The host can recognize quinones over their close analogues in water, and its association affinity to p-benzoquinone is the highest among all the known hosts and is even comparable to that of the bioreceptor. The binding with an anthraquinone reaches nanomolar affinity. Shielded hydrogen bonding, C-H\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5pi, and charge transfer interactions, and the hydrophobic effect are responsible for the high binding affinity and selectivity.",

        "abstract": "To determine associations between surgeon volume and esophagectomy outcomes at a high-volume institution. All esophagectomies for esophageal cancer at our institution from August 2005 to August 2019 were reviewed. Cases were divided by surgeon into low, <7 cases/year, vs high volume, >/=7 cases/year, based on Leapfrog Group recommendations. Surgeons remained 'high-volume' after one year of >/=7 cases. Demographics, comorbidities, course of care, and long-term outcomes were compared. In total, 1029 cases were evaluated; 120 performed by low-volume surgeons vs 909 by high-volume surgeons. Never-smokers, atrial fibrillation, and clinical Stage IVa patients were associated with high-volume surgeons. Other demographics were similar. Low-volume surgeons did more open cases, 45.8% vs 14.5%, P < 0.01. Low-volume surgeons had more complications than high-volume surgeons (71.7% vs 57.6%, P < 0.01), specifically Grade II and III (59.2% vs 46.8%, P = 0.01, and 44.2% vs 27.0%, P <0.01). No differences were seen in anastomotic leak rate, 90-day mortality, recurrences, 5-year overall survival (46.7% low-volume vs 49.3% high-volume, P = 0.64), or 5-year disease-free survival (35.7% low-volume vs 42.2% high-volume, P = 0.27). In multivariable logistic regression for Grade III or higher complications, high-volume surgeons had an odds ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.36-0.87) for complications. Our study found higher rates of open esophagectomies and complications in low-volume esophagectomy surgeons compared to high-volume surgeons at the same, high-volume institution. However, low-volume surgeons were not associated with worse survival outcomes compared to high-volume surgeons. Low-volume esophagectomy surgeons may benefit from mentoring and support to improve perioperative outcomes; these efforts are underway at our institution.",

We recruited female adolescents free of binge eating or compensatory behaviors (N = 88; M(age) = 14.6 [SD = .9]; 72% White) with versus without parental history of eating pathology. Parental-history-positive youth showed elevated reward region response (putamen) to anticipated tastes of chocolate milkshake, and greater emotionality, caloric deprivation, weight and shape overvaluation, and feeling fat (though no difference in weight), but lower liking of high-calorie foods, which were medium to large effects. We did not observe statistically significant differences in neural responsivity for the other paradigms. The evidence that parental-history-positive youth show greater reward region response to anticipated tastes of high-calorie food, overvaluation of weight/shape, feeling fat, caloric deprivation, emotionality, and lower liking of high-calorie foods before evidencing behavioral symptoms of eating disorders are novel findings. Weight/shape overvaluation may contribute to feeling fat, lower food liking, and caloric deprivation; the latter may drive elevated reward region response to anticipated consumption of high-calorie food and emotionality.

        "abstract": "MsrPQ is a new type of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) system found in bacteria. It is specifically involved in the repair of periplasmic methionine residues that are oxidized by hypochlorous acid. MsrP is a periplasmic molybdoenzyme that carries out the Msr activity, whereas MsrQ, an integral membrane-bound hemoprotein, acts as the physiological partner of MsrP to provide electrons for catalysis. Although MsrQ (YedZ) was associated since long with a protein superfamily named FRD (ferric reductase domain), including the eukaryotic NADPH oxidases and STEAP proteins, its biochemical properties are still sparsely documented. Here, we have investigated the cofactor content of the E. coli MsrQ and its mechanism of reduction by the flavin reductase Fre. We showed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy that MsrQ contains a single highly anisotropic low-spin (HALS) b-type heme located on the periplasmic side of the membrane. We further demonstrated that MsrQ holds a flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor that occupies the site where a second heme binds in other members of the FDR superfamily on the cytosolic side of the membrane. EPR spectroscopy indicates that the FMN cofactor can accommodate a radical semiquinone species. The cytosolic flavin reductase Fre was previously shown to reduce the MsrQ heme. Here, we demonstrated that Fre uses the FMN MsrQ cofactor as a substrate to catalyze the electron transfer from cytosolic NADH to the heme. Formation of a specific complex between MsrQ and Fre could favor this unprecedented mechanism, which most likely involves transfer of the reduced FMN cofactor from the Fre active site to MsrQ.",

This study aimed to assess the results of brucellosis seroprevalence among participants of the Famenin brucellosis cohort with molecular investigation technique and determine Brucella-approved species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following the first phase of the Famenin brucellosis cohort in 2016 which investigated the seroprevalence of brucellosis among 2367 participants in Famenin city, a total of 575 people including all seropositive and some seronegative people were examined again by wright serological tests in 2019. The PCR assay was accomplished on all cases that have wright titers >/= 1/20 for tracing Brucella DNA using BCSP31 target gene and IS711 locus. RESULTS: Out of 575 studied cases, 145 people had wright titers >/= 1/20. The PCR reactions of these 145 blood samples were positive in 63/145 (43.44%) tested samples using primers (B4/B5) for Brucella genus detection. In the second PCR assay using specific-primers for Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis, 18/63 (28.57%) of the samples were diagnosed as B. abortus, and 18/63 (28.57%) were diagnosed as B. melitensis. CONCLUSION: In this study, using the selected specific genes for the diagnosis of Brucella in the genus and species levels, the PCR technique was evaluated as a promising method for the rapid and safe detection of brucellosis besides the serological test for more accurate detection of brucellosis especially in cases that are not definitive.",

        "abstract": "Globally, measles remains a major cause of child mortality, and rubella is the leading cause of birth defects among all infectious diseases. In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan that set a target to eliminate Measles-Rubella (MR) in five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020. This was cross-sectional study employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The sample size was calculated to provide overall, age- and sex-specific coverage estimates for MR vaccine among children aged between 9 and 59 months at the national level. Using desired precision of +/-5% with an expected coverage of 95%, a total of 15,235 households were required. The age of children, a child who had received the MR vaccine before the campaign, household wealth quintile, the age of caregivers, and their marital status were associated with non-coverage of MR vaccination among children aged 9-59 months in Tanzania. Nationally, an estimated 88.2% (95% CI: 87.3-89%) of children aged 9-59 months received the MR campaign dose, as assessed by caregivers' recall. These estimates revealed slightly higher coverage in Zanzibar 89.6% (95% CI: 84.7-93%) compared to Mainland Tanzania 88.1% (95% CI 87.2-88.9%). These associated factors revealed causes of unvaccinated children and may be some of the reasons for Tanzania's failure to meet the MR campaign target of 95 percent vaccination coverage. Thus, vaccine development must increase programmatic oversight in order to improve immunization activities and communication strategies in Tanzanian areas with low MR coverage.",

However, it remains unknown whether high levels of MG are a cause or consequence of diabetes. Here, we show that MG negatively affects the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which is involved in thermogenesis and the regulation of systemic metabolism. Decreased Ucp1 expression is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We found that MG attenuated the increase in Ucp1 expression following treatment with isoproterenol in beige adipocytes. However, MG did not affect protein kinase A signaling, the core coordinator of isoproterenol-induced Ucp1 expression. Instead, MG activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. We found that JNK inhibition, but not p38, recovered isoproterenol-stimulated Ucp1 expression under MG treatment. Altogether, these results suggest an inhibitory role of MG on the thermogenic function of beige adipocytes through the JNK signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammations of the oral cavity, which eventually leads to tooth loss. Betulinic acid (BetA) is an organic acid that has anti-inflammatory effects and is derived from fruits and plants, but its effect on the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of BetA on the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs and its mechanism. Our results revealed that BetA not only promoted the viability of hPDLSCs but also induced their osteogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, RNA sequencing was used to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after hPDLSCs were treated with BetA, and 127 upregulated and 138 downregulated genes were identified. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that DEGs were mainly involved in the response to lithium ions and the positive regulation of macrophage-derived foam cell differentiation. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis results revealed that DEGs were enriched in the nuclear factor-kappaB and interleukin-17 signaling pathways. More importantly, we confirmed that early growth response gene 1 (EGR1), one of the three DEGs involved in bone formation, significantly promoted the expression of osteogenic markers and the mineralization of hPDLSCs. Knockdown of EGR1 obviously limited the effect of BetA on the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. In conclusion, BetA promoted the osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs through upregulating EGR1, and BetA might be a promising candidate in the clinical application of periodontal tissue regeneration.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and contributing risk factors among resident doctors working in a tertiary care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey from May to July 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to the coronavirus, application of personal hygiene rules, presence and use of personal protective equipment, anxiety and prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder were investigated. RESULTS: In total, 17.8% (n = 40) of 225 resident doctors who participated in the study had post-traumatic stress disorder. Working at a department serving to COVID-19 patients increased the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder by 2.9 times (OR = 2.936, p = 0.003) while contacting positive patients increased this risk by 2.6 times (OR = 2.607, p = 0.023) and lack of personal protective equipment by 3.6 times (OR = 3.656, p = 0.018). Anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher in women, married and those living with their parents or spouses and children (p = 0.049; p = 0.011; p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Working in a department serving to COVID-19 patients, contact with positive patients and lack of personal protective equipment were risk factors in the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder in resident doctors.

However, an overstimulated complement can quickly alter the C5a-C5aR1 function from physiological to pathological, as has been noted in the case of several chronic inflammation-induced diseases like asthma, lung injury, multiorgan failure, sepsis, and now COVID-19. In the absence of the structural data, the current study provides the confirmatory biophysical validation of the hypothesized \"two-site\" binding interactions of C5a, involving (i) the N-terminus (NT) peptide (\"Site1\") and (ii) the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) peptide of the extracellular surface (ECS) of the C5aR1 (\"Site2\"), as illustrated earlier in the reported model structural complex of C5a-C5aR1. The biophysical and computational data elaborated in the study provides an improved understanding of the C5a-C5aR1 interaction at an atomistic resolution, highlighting the energetic importance of the aspartic acids on the NT-peptide of C5aR1 toward binding of C5a. The current study can potentially advance the search and optimization of new-generation alternative \"antibodies\" as well as \"neutraligands\" targeting the C5a to modulate its interaction with C5aR1.",

We examined the effect of alkali therapy on vascular endothelial function in KTRs. METHODS: We performed an 18-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study examining the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy versus placebo on vascular function in 20 adult KTRs at least 1 year from transplant with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >/=45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a serum bicarbonate level of 20 to 26 mEq/L. Each treatment period was 8 weeks in duration with a 2-week washout period between treatments. The primary outcome was change in brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) between sodium bicarbonate treatment and placebo. RESULTS: Twenty patients completed the study and were included in the primary analysis. The mean (SD) baseline eGFR of participants was 75 (22) ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively. Serum bicarbonate levels did not increase significantly with treatment (0.3 [1.5] mEq/L, P = 0.37). Sodium bicarbonate therapy was not associated with worsening blood pressure, weight gain, or hypokalemia. There was no significant increase in FMD after 8 weeks of sodium bicarbonate therapy compared to placebo (mean change in FMD 2.2%, 95% CI -0.1 to 4.6, P = 0.06). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, eGFR, or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio during treatment. Urinary ammonium excretion decreased by 9 mmol/d (P=0.003), with sodium bicarbonate. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium bicarbonate therapy is safe and feasible in KTRs, and our results strengthen the need for a larger randomized controlled trial.",

        "abstract": "In the last years, endoscopic techniques gained a crucial role in the treatment of colorectal flat lesions. At the same time, the importance of a reliable assessment of such lesions to predict the malignancy and the depth of invasion of the colonic wall emerged. The current unsolved dilemma about the endoscopic excision techniques concerns the necessity of a reliable submucosal invasive cancer assessment system that can stratify the risk of the post-procedural need for surgery. Accordingly, this narrative literature review aims to compare the available diagnostic strategies in predicting malignancy and to give a guide about the best techniques to employ. We performed a literature search using electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library). We collected all articles about endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) registering the outcomes. Moreover, we analyzed all meta-analyses comparing EMR vs ESD outcomes for colorectal sessile or non-polypoid lesions of any size, preoperatively estimated as non-invasive. Seven meta-analysis studies, mainly Eastern, were included in the analysis comparing 124 studies and overall 22954 patients who underwent EMR and ESD procedures. Of these, eighty-two were retrospective, twenty-four perspective, nine case-control, and six cohorts, while three were randomized clinical trials. A total of 18118 EMR and 10379 ESD were completed for a whole of 28497 colorectal sessile or non-polypoid lesions > 5-10 mm in size. In conclusion, it is crucial to enhance the preoperative diagnostic workup, especially in deciding the most suitable endoscopic method for radical resection of flat colorectal lesions at risk of underlying malignancy. Additionally, the ESD necessitates further improvement because of the excessively time-consuming as well as the intraprocedural technical hindrances and related complications. We found a higher rate of en bloc resections and R0 for ESD than EMR for non-pedunculated colorectal lesions. Nevertheless, despite the lower local recurrence rates, ESD had greater perforation rates and needed lengthier procedural times. The prevailing risk for additional surgery in ESD rather than EMR for complications or oncologic reasons is still uncertain.",

Improvements in mean (95% CI) cardiorespiratory fitness (16.4% (13.2-19.6%), p < 0.001) and handgrip strength (8.0% (5.4-10.6%), p < 0.001) were observed over the course of the cardiac rehabilitation program, and these improvements were maintained in the 12 months following completion. Waist circumference (p = 0.003) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001) were the only traditional cardiovascular risk factors to improve during the cardiac rehabilitation program. Vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise was associated with significantly greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, Framingham risk score, and waist circumference in comparison to moderate-intensity exercise. An increase in the intensity of the exercise prescribed during cardiac rehabilitation in Australia is recommended to induce larger improvements in physical capacity outcomes and cardiovascular risk. A standardized exercise test at the beginning of the rehabilitation program is recommended to facilitate appropriate prescription of exercise intensity.",

However, their role in periodontitis subjects with coronary heart disease remains unclear. This study aimed to obtain the expression of NLRP3 (rs35829419) and IL-1beta (+3954) gene polymorphisms in the subgingival plaque and blood samples of generalized periodontitis (GP) subjects with and without coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: A total of 70 subjects were grouped into two; GP and GP with CHD. Demographic variables and periodontal and cardiac parameters were recorded from both the groups. Subgingival plaque and blood samples were obtained from both the groups and were further subjected to the identification of NLRP3 (rs35829419) and IL-1beta (+3954) expression and allele change using a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing (Sanger's method). RESULTS: Amongst the demographic variables, age and monthly income were statistically significant between the two groups. Plaque index (PI), clinical attachment level (CAL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low density-lipoprotein (LDL) exhibited statistically significant levels between the two groups. The NLRP3 (rs35829419) and IL-1beta (+3954) genes showed a statistically significant association with allele change (frequency) among the groups. The general comparison of all the parameters with the allele change of NLRP3 (rs35829419) and IL-1beta (+3954) in the subgingival plaque and blood samples showed statistically significant associations among the two groups. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted an allele change in IL-1beta (+3954) gene polymorphisms which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and coronary heart disease.",

        "abstract": "Backgrounds and Objectives: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has currently become the \"first-line choice\" for descending aortic pathologies. For pathologies located at the aortic arch, TEVAR with physician-modified fenestration (PMF) has been gained popularity as an alternative choice. However, stent fenestration is an experience-dependent technique and comes with possible adverse events such as misalignment. This study aims to introduce the self-radiopaque PMF (SF), which uses the radiopaque marker as a guiding indicator. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study of 125 patients who underwent the SF-TEVAR in Second Xiangya Hospital from December 2015 to December 2020. Data include basic clinical information and technique records of SF-TEVAR with follow-up results. Results: According to the SF-TEVAR protocol, we have performed the procedures on 125 patients and obtained an instant success rate of 98.4%. A total of 140 aortic stent-grafts and 44 bridging stents have been implanted in this study. The operation time is 64.6 +/- 19.3 min, X-ray exposure time (from first digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to last DSA) is 25.6 +/- 14.3 min, and contrast volume is 82.2 +/- 22.6 ml. The success rate of PMF alignment is 98.4%. One bailout stent-graft was implanted into the left subclavian artery (LSA) by the chimney technique (0.8%). One fenestration was successfully and immediately corrected after misalignment (0.8%). Large simultaneous fenestration was performed in six patients (4.8%) for the left common carotid artery (LCCA) and LSA and in two patients (1.6%) for IA, LCCA, and LSA. One hundred twenty-two out of 125 patients' LSAs have been kept patent by the technique during the follow-up. The bridging stent group consists of 44 patients who received LSA stents, while the non-bridging stent group includes the other 81 patients. Type I endoleak has occurred in seven patients (5.6%) 1 week after the procedure. During follow-up (23 +/- 18 months), survival rate is 95.7% and branch artery patent rate is 97.4%. Conclusions: The SF-TEVAR technique, which utilizes the radiopaque marker in stent-graft as an indication for PMF in TEVAR, seems a likely safe, effective, and efficient procedure that brings acceptable survival rate and branch artery patency rate. SF-TEVAR serves as a progressive alternative method to keep the branch artery patent in aortic arch endovascular reconstruction.",

We tested the hypothesis of a protective association between prenatal folic acid use and neonatal diabetes or hyperglycemia and type 1 diabetes in an observational cohort study using data from the national population health registers in Norway. METHODS: All singleton pregnancies resulting in live births from 2005 to 2018 were identified. Prenatal exposure to folic acid was determined based on maternal report at antenatal care in early pregnancy. Diagnoses of neonatal diabetes, hyperglycemia, and type 1 diabetes for the children were identified. Associations were estimated with logistic regression or Cox proportional hazard model and included crude and adjusted estimates. RESULTS: Among 781,567 children, 69% had prenatal exposure to folic acid, 264 were diagnosed with neonatal diabetes or hyperglycemia, and 1390 with type 1 diabetes. Compared to children with no prenatal exposure to folic acid, children with prenatal exposure to folic acid had similar odds of having a neonatal diabetes or hyperglycemia diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.25) and similar risk of being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.93, 1.18). CONCLUSIONS: No association between prenatal folic acid exposure and neonatal diabetes/hyperglycemia or type 1 diabetes was found. These findings do not rule out a translational effect of the experimental results and future studies with longer follow-up and more precise information on the window of prenatal exposure are needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Verbal autopsy is a pragmatic approach for generating cause-of-death data in contexts without well-functioning civil registration and vital statistics systems. It has primarily been conducted in health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) in Africa and Asia. Although significant resources have been invested to develop the technical aspects of verbal autopsy, ethical issues have received little attention. We explored the benefits and burdens of verbal autopsy in HDSS settings and identified potential strategies to respond to the ethical issues identified. METHODS: This research was based on a case study approach centred on two contrasting HDSS in Kenya and followed the Mapping-Framing-Shaping Framework for empirical bioethics research. Data were collected through individual interviews, focus group discussions, document reviews and non-participant observations. 115 participants were involved, including 86 community members (HDSS residents and community representatives), and 29 research staff (HDSS managers, researchers, census field workers and verbal autopsy interviewers). RESULTS: The use of verbal autopsy data for research and public health was described as the most common potential benefit of verbal autopsy in HDSS. Community members mentioned the potential uses of verbal autopsy data in addressing immediate public health problems for the local population while research staff emphasized the benefits of verbal autopsy to research and the wider public. The most prominent burden associated with the verbal autopsy was emotional distress for verbal autopsy interviewers and respondents. Moral events linked to the interview, such as being unsure of the right thing to do (moral uncertainty) or knowing the right thing to do and being constrained from acting (moral constraint), emerged as key causes of emotional distress for verbal autopsy interviewers. CONCLUSIONS: The collection of cause-of-death data through verbal autopsy in HDSS settings presents important ethical and emotional challenges for verbal autopsy interviewers and respondents. These challenges include emotional distress for respondents and moral distress for interviewers. This empirical ethics study provides detailed accounts of the distress caused by verbal autopsy and highlights ethical tensions between potential population benefits and risks to individuals. It includes recommendations for policy and practice to address emotional and moral distress in verbal autopsy.",

        "abstract": "Damage to the cochlear sensory epithelium is a key contributor to noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). KCNQ4 plays an important role in the cochlear potassium circulation and outer hair cells survival. As miR-153 can target and regulate KCNQ4, we sought to study the role of miR-153 in SNHL. 12-week-old male CBA/J mice were exposed to 2-20 kHz broadband noise at 96 dB SPL to induce temporary threshold shifts and 101 dB SPL to induce permanent threshold shifts. Hearing loss was determined by auditory brainstem responses (ABR). Relative expression of miR-153 and KCNQ4 in mice cochlea were determined by Real-Time quantitative PCR. miR-153 mimics were co-transfected with wild type or mutated KCNQ4 into HEK293 cells. Luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the binding between miR-153 and KCNQ4. AAV-sp-153 was constructed and administrated intra-peritoneally 24- and 2-h prior and immediately after noise exposure to knockdown miR-153. The KCNQ4 is mainly expressed in outer hair cells (OHCs). We showed that the expression of KCNQ4 in mice cochlea was reduced and miR-153 expression was significantly increased after noise exposure compared to control. miR-153 bound to 3'UTR of KNCQ4, and the knockdown of miR-153 with the AAV-sp-153 administration restored KCNQ4 mRNA and protein expression. In addition, the knockdown of miR-153 reduced ABR threshold shifts at 8, 16, and 32 kHz after permanent threshold shifts (PTS) noise exposure. Correspondingly, OHC losses were attenuated with inhibition of miR-153. This study demonstrates that miR-153 inhibition significantly restores KNCQ4 in cochlea after noise exposure, which attenuates SNHL. Our study provides a new potential therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of SNHL.",

Periphery of lymphoid follicles showed BCL-2 positivity and BCL-6 positivity focally at the center. CD30 and toluidine blue staining showed positivity, and several mast cells were confirmed. The immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement result showed B-cell monoclonality. The patient's condition was diagnosed as cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, plasmacytoid type with mastocytosis. Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma with a tendency for local recurrence. In the specimen obtained from our patient, multiple mast cells were observed. Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma with prominent mastocytosis is rare and there are a few reported cases. Therefore, this case is worth reporting for its rarity and for the purpose of reminding mastocytosis in primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.",

Here, we conduct a bedside-to-bench-and-back investigation to study the pathophysiology of lipin1 deficiency. We find that lipin1-deficient myoblasts exhibit a reduction in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate close to autophagosomes and late endosomes that prevents the recruitment of the GTPase Armus, locks Rab7 in the active state, inhibits vesicle clearance by fusion with lysosomes, and alters their positioning and function. Oxidized mitochondrial DNA accumulates in late endosomes, where it activates Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and triggers inflammatory signaling and caspase-dependent myolysis. Hydroxychloroquine blocks TLR9 activation by mitochondrial DNA in vitro and may attenuate flares of rhabdomyolysis in 6 patients treated. We suggest a critical role for defective clearance of oxidized mitochondrial DNA that activates TLR9-restricted inflammation in lipin1-related rhabdomyolysis. Interventions blocking TLR9 activation or inflammation can improve patient care in vivo.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease and is one of the most costly medical conditions that imposed families with catastrophic health expenditures. There is an increasing trend in using alternative medicines including, dietary supplements, herbs, vitamins, and minerals. To date, the association between dietary as well as herbal supplements and QoL in MS patients is under researched; thus, this study aimed to assess the association between the self-reported supplement used and QoL between MS patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with MS referring to Shahid Kazemi Pharmacy, based in the city of Tehran, Iran, as a national pharmacy providing specialized pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical care to patients. The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54) tools was performed to evaluate MS patients QoL. RESULTS: A total number of 382 patients with MS participated in this study. They include 89 (23.3%) men and 293 (76.7%) women, aged 40 +/- 10.9 years old. The overall score of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire was 41.58 out of 100. Physical health composite (PHC) and mental health composite (MHC) were 69.60 and 62.99 from 100, respectively. This study revealed that 76.4% of patients used at least one vitamin daily; 92.4% of patients do not receive any herbal product. Vitamin D is the most widely used supplement, followed by calcium, while vitamin C is the least consumed. No correlation was observed regarding supplement use and overall QoL, PHC, or MHC. There were no significant differences between QoL's dimensions score in patients who used supplements. The results showed that increasing the number of supplements used did not relate to overall QoL, PHC, or MHC. In addition, there was not any correlation between the duration used of supplements and QoL's dimensions score in MS patients (p-value> 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary supplement appears to be popular among MS patients. The study results showed that the number of supplementations and their long-term use in patients with MS were not associated with higher QoL. Similarly, the herbal supplements have failed to improve QoL.",

        "abstract": "School salad bars are widely promoted as a means to increase adherence to National School Lunch Program (NSLP) nutrition mandates. Yet it is unknown how salad bars or fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake relates to energy intake within the NSLP, or if F&Vs displace energy from other sources. This relation is particularly important to understand among children from minoritized backgrounds, who are at high risk of obesity and food insecurity, and the most likely to be impacted by school food policies, given their reliance on school meals. This study purpose was to evaluate if school salad bars and F&V intake are associated with lower lunch energy intake. Energy intake in Virginia elementary schools with and without salad bars, and associations between F&V energy and other energy sources, were examined. Cross-sectional plate waste assessments were conducted in matched school pairs (3 with, 3 without salad bars; N = 1,102 students; >90% Black and Latinx; 100% free meals). Two-level hierarchical models assessed group differences in energy intake and the proportion of energy from each meal component. Mean total lunch energy intake was 304 +/- 157 kcal (salad bar); 269 +/- 152 kcal (no salad bar). Students in salad bar schools consumed more energy from vegetables (+11 kcal; P < .001). Energy intake patterns were inconsistent across pairs. F&V energy was not associated with non-F&V energy (F = 1.04, P = .31). Findings do not suggest that salad bars were associated with lower energy intake. Evidence was inconsistent regarding F&V displacement of other lunch calories. Further research regarding F&V, salad bars, and energy intake is needed.",

In a prospective observational study, preterm infants with an increase in CREs after the first rIM were monitored for CREs before and after the second rIM. Seventy-one infants with a median gestational age of 26.4 weeks and a median weight of 820 g at birth were investigated at a median postnatal age of 94 days. All but seven infants showed an increase in CREs after the second rIM. The frequency of hypoxemias (p < 0.0001), apneas (p = 0.0003) and cardiorespiratory events requiring tactile stimulation (CRE-ts) (p = 0.0034) increased significantly. The 25 infants (35%) presenting with CRE-ts were significantly more likely to have been continuously hospitalized since birth (p = 0.001) and to receive analeptic therapy at the first rIM (p = 0.002) or some kind of respiratory support at the first (p = 0.005) and second rIM (p < 0.0001). At a postmenstruational age of 43.5 weeks, CRE-ts ceased. Our data support the recommendation to monitor infants who fulfil the above-mentioned criteria during the second rIM up to a postmenstruational age of 44 weeks.",

The \"Cancer Hallmarks\" comprise crucial biological properties that mediate the advancement of the disease and affect patient prognosis. These hallmarks have been proposed to overlap with essential features of the WH process. However, common hallmarks and proteins actively participating in both processes have yet to be described. In this work we identify 21 WH proteins strongly linked with solid tumors by integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer and multi-omics analyses. These proteins were associated with eight of the ten described cancer hallmarks, especially avoiding immune destruction. These results show that WH and cancer's common proteins are involved in the microenvironment modification of solid tissues and immune system regulation. This set of proteins, between WH and cancer, could represent key targets for developing therapies.",

        "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the molecular pathways mediating wound healing induce cell migration and localization of cytokines to sites of injury. Macrophages are immune cells that sense and actively respond to disturbances in tissue homeostasis by initiating, and subsequently resolving, inflammation. Hypoxic conditions generated at a wound site also strongly recruit macrophages and affect their function. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha is a transcription factor that contributes to both glycolysis and the induction of inflammatory genes, while also being critical for macrophage activation. For the latter, HIF-1alpha regulates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) to affect the migration, activation, differentiation, and polarization of macrophages. Recently, S1P and HIF-1alpha have received much attention, and various studies have been performed to investigate their roles in initiating and resolving inflammation via macrophages. It is hypothesized that the HIF-1alpha/S1P/S1P receptor axis is an important determinant of macrophage function under inflammatory conditions and during disease pathogenesis. Therefore, in this review, biological regulation of monocytes/macrophages in response to circulating HIF-1alpha is summarized, including signaling by S1P/S1P receptors, which have essential roles in wound healing.",

Therefore, this research analyzes people's perceptions of greenhouse gas emissions and their preferences for renewable energy resources using a sample of Twitter data. We first identify themes of discussion using semantic text similarity and network analysis. Next, we measure people's interest in renewable energy resources based on the mentioned rate in Twitter and search interest in Google trends. Then, we measure people's sentiment toward these resources and compare the interest with sentiments to identify opportunities for policy improvement. The results indicate a minor influence of governmental assemblies on Twitter discourses compared to a very high influence of two renewable energy providers amounts to more than 40% of the tweeting activities related to renewable energy. The search interest analysis shows a slight shift in people's interest in favor of renewable energy. The interest in geothermal energy is decreasing while interest in biomass energy is increasing. The sentiment analysis shows that biomass energy has the highest positive sentiments while solar and wind energy have higher interest. Solar and wind energy are found to be the two most promising sources for the future energy transition. Our study implies that governments should practice a higher influence on promoting awareness of the environment and converging between people's interests and feasible energy solutions. We also advocate Twitter as a source for collecting real-time data about social preferences for environmental policy input.",

B7-H3 knockdown affected the expression of metastasis-related genes and significantly suppressed the metastasis of ccRCC cells, but it had no significant effect on the proliferation of ccRCC cells. Database analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between B7-H3 and fibronectin (FN) in ccRCC cells, and further study also confirmed that FN interacts with B7-H3. Silencing FN expression inhibited the migration and invasion of ccRCC cells, whereas exogenous FN promoted the migration and invasion of ccRCC cells, which was accompanied by activation of kinases [namely, phosphorylated (p)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p-protein kinase B, p-p38 and p-extracellular regulated protein kinase]. B7-H3 knockdown abolished the prometastatic effect of FN. In conclusion, our data suggest that B7-H3 binds to exogenous FN and promotes the metastasis of ccRCC cells.",

The structures of the isolates were confirmed by HR-MS, 1D, and 2D NMR as well as by comparison with the literature. The protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) effects of the isolated compounds (1-30) were evaluated using sodium orthovanadate and ursolic acid as a positive control. Among them, trimeric phloroglucinols 26-28 significantly exhibited the PTP1B inhibitory effects with the IC(50) values of 1.19 +/- 0.13, 1.00 +/- 0.04, 1.23 +/- 0.05 muM, respectively. In addition, the kinetic analysis revealed compounds 26-28 acted as competitive inhibitors against PTP1B enzyme with K(i) values of 0.63, 0.61, 1.57 muM, respectively. Molecular docking simulations were performed to demonstrate that these active compounds can bind with the catalytic sites of PTP1B with negative binding energies and the results are in accordance with that of the kinetic studies. In vitro and in silico results suggest that D. crassirhizoma rhizomes together with compounds 26-28 are potential candidates for treating type 2 diabetes.",

Some of theoretical studies suggested that anisotropic superconductivity is realized in the BiCh(2)-based superconductors. In experimental studies, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurement on the superconducting states of Nd(O,F)BiS(2)have revealed the anisotropic structure of the superconducting gap, and the absence of isotope effect have been reported, indicating unconventional superconductivity pairing. Furthermore, two-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance have been observed in the superconducting states of some of Bi(S,Se)(2)-based systems like La(O,F)Bi(S,Se)(2)while the crystal structure possesses a tetragonal square plane with four-fold symmetry. Those results indicate nematic superconductivity is emerging in BiCh(2)-based superconductors. On the basis of the observations suggesting unconventional superconductivity in BiCh(2)-based systems, clarification of pairing mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh(2)-based superconductors have been highly desired. In this article, we review experimental results on the superconducting gap structure, the pairing mechanism, and related phenomena of BiCh(2)-based superconductors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical trials showed strong evidence that voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) reduces the acquisition of HIV among heterosexual men by up to 60%. However, VMMC uptake in East and Southern Africa remains suboptimal, with safety concerns identified as a barrier to uptake. We investigated the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs) in a routine VMMC programme implemented in Gauteng and North West provinces of South Africa. METHODS: We describe the frequency and characteristics of AEs using routinely collected data from a VMMC programme implemented between 01 May 2013 and 31 December 2014. The surgical procedure was provided at fixed clinics and mobile units in three districts. Adult men undertaking the procedure were referred for follow-up appointments where AEs were monitored. RESULTS: A total of 7,963 adult men were offered the VMMC service with 7,864 (98.8%) met the age and consent requirements for inclusion in a research follow-up after the surgical procedure and were followed-up for potential AEs. In total, 37 (0.5%) patients reported AEs post-surgery with infection [11 (29.7%)] and excessive bleeding [11 (29.7%)] commonly reported AEs. In terms of severity, 14 (37.8%) were classified as mild, 13 (35.1%) as moderate, and 10 (27.0%) as severe. Further, 32 (86.5%) of the AEs were classified as definitely related to the surgical procedure, with 36 (97.5%) of all AEs resolving without sequelae. CONCLUSION: The VMMC programme was able to reach adult men at high risk of HIV acquisition. Reported AEs in the programme were minimal, with the observed safety profile comparable to clinical trial settings, suggesting that VMMC can be safely administered in a programmatic setting.",

        "abstract": "AIM: The focus of this study is to propose a new implant design that will resemble the tooth anatomy as with three roots thus increase the primary stability in bone and open new indications to dental implant applications. METHODS: Developed implant design and control implants were fabricated from Grade 4 type medical titanium. Three different media are selected as similar structural mechanical properties of alveolar cancellous bone quality; bovine iliac bone, bovine spinal bone, and polymer block. Implant sites were prepared with a 2-mm final drill. Then implants were inserted and all insertion torques were recorded. Starting from 5 Ncm implants were applied removal torques to test the initial stability. The sample that withstands the removal torque is marked with \"+\" until the torque value where the implant started to move out from the bone socket. RESULTS: Different bone structures and polymer material, designed implant with apical arms have shown relatively average gains of % 38.6 in bovine spinal bone samples, % 38.2 in bovine iliac bone samples and % 46.4 gain in polymer block in retention to removal torques. In the Bovine spinal bone environment, the percentage of gain of the Implant Group developed was significantly higher than the Control Implant Group (p: 0.000; P < 0.05). In the Bovine iliac bone medium, the percentage of gain of the Implant Group developed was significantly higher than the Control Implant Group (p: 0.002; P < 0.05). In the Polymer block environment, the gain percentage of the Implant Group developed was significantly higher than the Control Implant Group (p: 0.008; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate promising positive future directions to make further researches on the material production and testings of such a new dental implant design including in vivo clinical controlled studies will be beneficial for better understanding the behavior of the developed implant design under different conditions.",

These data points contain six inputs, including time, volumetric concentration, heat flux, mass flow rate, inlet temperature, thermal conductivity and fouling resistance as an output. The experimental data are used for training, testing and validation of the ANN using multiple layer perceptron (MLP). The comparison of statistical criteria of different networks shows that the optimal structure for predicting the fouling resistance of the nanofluid is the MLP network with 20 hidden neurons, which has been trained with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The accuracy of the model was assessed based on three known statistical metrics including mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and coefficient of determination (R(2)). The obtained model was found with the performance of MSE = 6.5377 x 10(-4), MAPE = 2.40% and R(2) = 0.99756 for the training stage, MSE = 3.9629 x 10(-4), MAPE = 1.8922% and R(2) = 0.99835 for the test stage and MSE = 5.8303 x 10(-4), MAPE = 2.57% and R(2) = 0.99812 for the validation stage.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute suppurative thyroiditis through the congenital pyriform sinus fistula (PSF) often recurs if the fistula is not resected. Although endoscopic chemo-cauterization (ECC) to obliterate the orifice of the fistula is less invasive than open fistulectomy, it may require repeated treatments. We recently adopted an endoscopic diode laser-cauterization (ELC) system with the intention of improving treatment outcomes in PSF. Here, we describe ELC and compare the outcomes of these three modalities. METHODS: We evaluated 83 patients with PSF who underwent treatment between 2007 and 2018 at Kuma Hospital, a tertiary thyroid treatment hospital. ECC and ELC were implemented in 2007 and 2015, respectively. Patients who were ineligible for the endoscopic procedures underwent open fistulectomy. Barium swallow studies and computed tomography scan under a trumpet maneuver were performed after treatment to evaluate obliteration or removal of the fistula. RESULTS: In total, 70 of the 81 (86%) patients who underwent barium swallow studies after the first treatment achieved obliteration or removal of the fistula. The success rates for open fistulectomy, ECC, and ELC were 100% (9/9), 83% (49/59), and 100% (13/13), respectively. ECC and ELC had significantly shorter operative times and lower blood loss than open fistulectomy. Insufficient opening of the mouth was the major reason for converting endoscopic procedures to open fistulectomy. CONCLUSIONS: ELC may yield superior outcomes and is therefore the optimal treatment modality for PSF. However, it is still associated with certain limitations. Thus, treatment selection remains dependent on the shape and size of the PSF and the mouth opening of the individual patient.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The manometric diagnosis of severe intestinal dysmotility is performed at most institutions using catheters with 2-8 sensors 5-10 cm apart. The recent application of high-resolution manometry catheters with closely spaced sensors to other gut segments has been highly successful. The objective of the present study was to determine the feasibility of a jejunal high-resolution manometry method and to carry out a descriptive analysis of normal jejunal motor function. METHODS: A 36-channel high-resolution water-perfused manometry catheter (MMS-Laborie, Enschede, The Netherlands) was orally placed in the jejunum of 18 healthy subjects (10 men, eight women; 21-38 age range). Intestinal motility was recorded during 5 h, 3 during fasting, and 2 after a 450 kcal solid-liquid meal. Analysis of motility patterns was supported by computerized tools. KEY RESULTS: All healthy subjects except one showed at least one complete migrating motor complex during the 3 h fasting period. Phase III activity lasted 5 +/- 1 min and migrated aborally at a velocity of 7 +/- 3 cm/min. High-resolution spatial analysis showed that during phase III each individual contraction propagated rapidly (75 +/- 37 cm/min) over a 32 +/- 10 cm segment of the jejunum. During phase II, most contractile activity corresponded to propagated contractile events which increased in frequency from early to late phase II (0.5 +/- 0.9 vs 2.5 +/- 1.3 events/10 min, respectively; p < 0.001). After meal ingestion, non-propagated activity increased, whereas propagated events were less frequent than during late phase II. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Jejunal motility analysis with high-resolution manometry identifies propagated contractile patterns which are not apparent with conventional manometric catheters.",

Enzyme reaction centers provide a constraint geometry that preferentially binds an activated form of the substrate and thus lowers the energy barrier. However, this transition state picture neglects the flexibility of proteins and its role in enzymatic catalysis. Especially for proton transfer reactions, it has been suggested that motions of the protein modulate the donor-acceptor distance and prepare a tunneling-ready state. We report the detection of frequency fluctuations of an azide anion (N(3)(-)) bound in the active site of the protein carbonic anhydrase II, where a low-frequency mode of the protein has been proposed to facilitate proton transfer over two water molecules during the catalyzed reaction. 2D-IR spectroscopy resolves an underdamped low-frequency mode at about 1 THz (30 cm(-1)). We find its frequency to be viscosity- and temperature-dependent and to decrease by 6 cm(-1) between 230 and 320 K, reporting the softening of the mode's potential.",

        "abstract": "Primary cilia are compartmentalised from the rest of the cell by a ciliary gate comprising transition fibres and a transition zone. The ciliary gate allows the selective import and export of molecules such as transmembrane receptors and transport proteins. These are required for the assembly of the cilium, its function as a sensory and signalling centre and to maintain its distinctive composition. Certain motile cilia can also form within the cytosol as exemplified by human and Drosophila sperm. The role of transition fibre proteins has not been well described in the cytoplasmic cilia. Drosophila have both compartmentalised primary cilia, in sensory neurons, and sperm flagella that form within the cytosol. Here, we describe phenotypes for twitchy the Drosophila orthologue of a transition fibre protein, mammalian FBF1/C. elegans dyf-19. Loss-of-function mutants in twitchy are adult lethal and display a severely uncoordinated phenotype. Twitchy flies are too uncoordinated to mate but RNAi-mediated loss of twitchy specifically within the male germline results in coordinated but infertile adults. Examination of sperm from twitchy RNAi-knockdown flies shows that the flagellar axoneme forms, elongates and is post-translationally modified by polyglycylation but the production of motile sperm is impaired. These results indicate that twitchy is required for the function of both sensory cilia that are compartmentalised from the rest of the cell and sperm flagella that are formed within the cytosol of the cell. Twitchy is therefore likely to function as part of a molecular gate in sensory neurons but may have a distinct function in sperm cells.",

However, the roles and mechanisms of INO80 in porcine pre-implantation embryonic development remain largely unknown. Here, we show that INO80 modulates trophectoderm epithelium permeability to promote porcine blastocyst development. The INO80 protein is highly expressed in the nuclei during morula-to-blastocyst transition. Functional studies revealed that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of INO80 severely blocks blastocyst formation and disrupts lineage allocation between the inner cell mass and trophectoderm. Mechanistically, single-embryo RNA sequencing revealed that INO80 regulates multiple genes, which are important for lineage specification, tight junction assembly, and fluid accumulation. Consistent with the altered expression of key genes required for tight junction assembly, a permeability assay showed that paracellular sealing is defective in the trophectoderm epithelium of INO80 knockdown blastocysts. Importantly, aggregation of 8-cell embryos from the control and INO80 knockdown groups restores blastocyst development and lineage allocation via direct complementation of the defective trophectoderm epithelium. Taken together, these results demonstrate that INO80 promotes blastocyst development by regulating the expression of key genes required for lineage specification, tight junction assembly, and fluid accumulation.",

Elevated levels of AHR have been observed in various human cancers, including lung carcinomas, hepatic carcinomas and in mammary tumors. However, the expression of AHR in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients who are tobacco users are less explored. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare AHR levels in OSSC patients and in normals using Western blot technique in an attempt to explore the possible role of AHR in oral carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of ten oral squamous cell carcinoma cases which were diagnosed clinically and confirmed histopathologically as OSCC and four samples of the normal oral mucosa. AHR protein expression was evaluated using Western blot technique and chemiluminescence detection kit. The densitometry was performed on a Microtek scan maker MSP flatbed scanner and quantified using Image J software. Mean AHR protein levels were calculated and compared between OSCC and normal oral mucosa using Student's t-test. RESULTS: The mean AHR protein level in OSCC samples (n = 10) was 2878.90 +/- 1231.27 and 975.75 +/- 227.27 in the normal oral mucosa (n = 4). The OSCC samples showed significantly higher levels of AHR protein compared to the normal oral mucosa (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: The study showed a significantly higher expression of AHR in oral squamous cell carcinoma samples when compared to the normal oral mucosa, suggesting a possible role of AHR in the initiation, promotion and progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma.",

RESULTS: The study findings indicate that bacterial infection prevalence differed significantly across the different disease status pre-salvage as patients with the relapsed disease were more likely to have bacterial infections. The median of engraftment days differed significantly between those who had a bacterial infection and those who did not. Interestingly, previous pneumonia infection had a positive relationship with the number of hospital stays. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections are the dominant type of infection among the autologous patient population. The research reflects authentic practice and reports unique characteristics of autologous transplant patients in terms of the prevalence and types of infection these patients experience.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer oligometastatic disease can be treated using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in order to postpone start of systemic treatments such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT imaging allows for diagnosis of oligometastases at lower PSA values. We analysed a cohort of patients with prostate cancer lymph node oligometastases detected on PSMA-PET/CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety patients with metachronous oligometastatic prostate cancer received SBRT for 1-3 lymph node metastases diagnosed on 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS), with disease progression defined as occurrence of either target lesion progression, new metastatic lesion or biochemical progression. Secondary outcomes were biochemical PFS (BPFS), ADT-free survival (ADT-FS), toxicity and quality of life (QoL). Baseline patient characteristics were tested for association with PFS and a preliminary risk score was created. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 21 months (interquartile range 10-31 months). Median PFS and BPFS were 16 and 21 months, respectively. Median ADT-FS was not reached (73% (95%-CI 62-86%) at 24 months). In multivariable analysis, younger age, higher PSA prior to SBRT and extrapelvic location were associated with shorter PFS. Grade 1 fatigue was the most predominant acute toxicity (34%). Highest grade toxicity was grade 2 for acute and late events. QoL analysis showed mild, transient increase in fatigue at 1-4 weeks after SBRT. CONCLUSION: A median PFS of 16 months was attained after SBRT for patients with PSMA-PET positive oligometastatic lymph nodes from prostate cancer. Higher pre-SBRT PSA, younger age and extrapelvic location were found to be predictors of shorter PFS.",

The aim of this study was to examine their needs and priorities during this time. Fourteen family and carers of inpatients experiencing psychosis completed semi-structured interviews examining their experiences of inpatient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Four key themes were identified: 'A turbulent journey to hospital admission', 'I need information and support', 'Maintaining my relationship with my loved one' and 'Inpatient care is a mixed bag'. Each theme comprised four or five subthemes. The findings demonstrated that family and carers feel excluded from inpatient care and struggled to maintain contact with their loved ones, which was exacerbated by COVID-19 related restrictions. Communication and being regularly informed about their loved one's care, as well as visiting loved ones, was particularly problematic. Inpatient care needs to be more inclusive of family and carers and ensure they are kept in mind at every stage of the admission.",

In a large monoinstitutional series of ECs, we evaluated the reliability and accuracy of Idylla assay, a rapid, fully automated system to detect MSI, and we compared its performance with two routine reference methods. METHODS: We evaluated MSI status in 174 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded EC tissue samples using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and Idylla assay. Samples with discordant or equivocal results were analysed with a third technique, the Promega MSI kit. RESULTS: Idylla MSI assay and IHC were highly concordant (overall agreement: 154/170=90.59%, 95% CI 85.26% to 94.12%). However, in four samples, MMR-IHC staining was equivocal; moreover, 16 cases showed discordant results, that is, MMR deficient using IHC and microsatellite stable using Idylla. These 20 samples were reanalysed using the MSI-Promega kit, which showed the same results of Idylla assay in 18/20 cases (overall agreement: 90%, 95% CI 69.90% to 97.21%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IHC is an efficient method to determine MMR status in ECs. However, the Idylla MSI assay is a rapid and reliable tool to define MSI status, and it could represent a valuable alternative to conventional MSI-PCR methods.",

We observed the consistent presence of the MaSp3B spidroin unique to this subfamily as well as several nonspidroin SpiCE proteins. Artificial synthesis and the combination of these components in vitro showed that the multicomponent nature of dragline silk, including MaSp3B and SpiCE, along with MaSp1 and MaSp2, is essential to realize the mechanical properties of spider dragline silk.",

Spontaneous activity and motor ability of mice among groups was detected by open-field test and swim-test. The expression of TH, microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3B II (LC3BII)/LC3BI, beclin-1, P62, forkhead box class O3 (FoxO3), phosphorylated (p) FoxO3a/FoxO3a, FoxO3, and endophilin A2 were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence staining. Our results showed that AngII treatment significantly increased the behavioral dysfunction of mice and DA neuron damage. Meanwhile, AngII treatment increased the expression of LC3BII/LC3BI, beclin-1, P62, and FoxO3a and decreased the expression of endophilin A2 and p-FoxO3a/FoxO3a, however, Bioch A treatment alleviate these changes. In summary, these results suggest that Bioch A exerts protective effects on AngII-induced mouse model may be related to regulating endophilin A2, FoxO3a, and autophagy-related proteins; however, the specific mechanism is not yet clear and needs further study.",

        "abstract": "Aquaporin-2 (Aqp2) gene transcription is strongly regulated by vasopressin in the renal collecting duct. However, the transcription factors (TFs) responsible for the regulation of expression of Aqp2 remain largely unknown. We used Bayes' theorem to integrate several -omics data sets to stratify the 1,344 TFs present in the mouse genome with regard to probabilities of regulating Aqp2 gene transcription. Also, we carried out new RNA sequencing experiments mapping the time course of vasopressin-induced changes in the transcriptome of mpkCCD cells to identify TFs that change in tandem with Aqp2. The analysis identified 17 of 1,344 TFs that are most likely to be involved in the regulation of Aqp2 gene transcription. These TFs included eight that have been proposed in prior studies to play a role in Aqp2 regulation, viz., Cebpb, Elf1, Elf3, Ets1, Jun, Junb, Nfkb1, and Sp1. The remaining nine represent new candidates for future studies (Atf1, Irf3, Klf5, Klf6, Mef2d, Nfyb, Nr2f6, Stat3, and Nr4a1). Conspicuously absent is CREB (Creb1), which has been widely proposed to mediate vasopressin-induced regulation of Aqp2 gene transcription (Nielsen S, Frokiaer J, Marples D, Kwon TH, Agre P, Knepper MA. Physiol Rev 82: 205-244, 2002; Kortenoeven ML, Fenton RA. Biochim Biophys Acta 1840: 1533-1549, 2014; Bockenhauer D, Bichet DG.

Instead, another CREB-like TF, Atf1, ranked fourth among all TFs. RNA sequencing time-course experiments showed a rapid increase in Aqp2 mRNA, within 3 h of vasopressin exposure. This response was matched by an equally rapid increase in the abundance of the mRNA coding for Cebpb, which we have shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing studies to bind downstream from the Aqp2 gene. The identified TFs provide a roadmap for future studies to understand regulation of Aqp2 gene expression.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Abetted by the advent of systems biology-based (\"-omics\") techniques in the 21st century, there has been a massive expansion of published data relevant to virtually every physiological question. The authors have developed a large-scale data integration approach based on the application of Bayes'' theorem. In the current work, they integrated 12 different -omics data sets to identify the transcription factors most likely to mediate vasopressin-dependent regulation of transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene.",

This study aimed to examine the longitudinal relationship of positivity and health-specific self-regulatory variables to health-related quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A sample of 550 cardiac patients completed a number of instruments (positivity, regulatory emotional self-efficacy, and cardiac self-efficacy scales, and the general health questionnaire SF-12) on two occasions 9 months apart, assessing their level of positivity, health-specific self-efficacy beliefs, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Mediational analyses demonstrated that health-specific self-efficacy beliefs mediate the relationship between positivity and health-related quality of life. In terms of self-efficacy in managing negative affect, the despondency-distress factor showed both direct and indirect effects on health, while the anger factor showed only an indirect effect. The results of the structural equation model demonstrated suitable indices of fit. CONCLUSIONS: Positivity may act as a disposition helps patients to use motivational strategies related to health, be more confident in their ability to regulate their emotions, and follow the recommendations of their cardiac medical team, enabling them to perceive a higher quality of life. These findings indicate the need to promote psychosocial interventions that include these variables.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) children undergoing hip reconstruction are more prone to blood loss during surgery due to poor nutritional status, antiepileptic medication intake, depletion of clotting factors, and the extent of surgery involved. We conducted this present review to analyze whether antifibrinolytics during hip surgery in CP children would reduce surgical blood loss and transfusion requirements. METHODS: Three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library) were searched independently for publications mentioning the use of antifibrinolytics during hip reconstruction surgery in CP children. The primary outcome was to compare the surgical blood loss with and without antifibrinolytics use. Secondary outcomes were transfusion requirements, drop in hemoglobin level, length of hospital stay, and complication rates. RESULTS: All five studies (reporting 478 patients) published on this topic were found eligible based on inclusion criteria and were included for final analysis. Primary outcome: In three of the included studies, antifibrinolytics use resulted in a significant reduction in total blood loss with a mean difference (MD) of -151.05 mL (95% CI -272.30 to -29.80, p = 0.01). In the other two studies although statistically not significant, antifibrinolytics use reduces estimated blood loss (MD: 3.27, 95% CI -21.44 to 14.91, p = 0.72). Secondary outcomes: We observed that in the antifibrinolytics group, there was a reduction in total blood transfusion requirements (OD: 0.70, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.37, p = 0.29), and a drop in haemoglobin level (MD: 0.16, 95% CI -0.62 to 0.30, p = 0.49) but statistically not significant. No adverse effects related directly to antifibrinolytics were noticed in all five studies. CONCLUSION: Only two out of five included studies favored the use of antifibrinolytics in CP children undergoing hip reconstruction. The evidence synthesized on this meta-analysis is also not sufficient enough to support its routine use in this cohort of children for hip reconstruction surgery. High-quality studies with adequate sample size to determine the effective and safe dosage, timing, and cost involved of different antifibrinolytics are the need of the hour.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Floor of the mouth (FOM) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for approximately 10% of all oral SCCs. FOM SCC can be classified into the anterior and posterior types according to their site of origin, but few studies have compared these types. This study sought to clarify differences in clinicopathological characteristics between these two types. METHODS: A total of 1,220 patients with oral SCC were treated at our department from January 2001 to December 2015. Among these patients, 62 had FOM SCC. The FOM SCCs were classified into two groups: the anterior type and the posterior type. The anterior and posterior types were defined by the boundary connecting the spaces between the canine and the first premolar bilaterally. We retrospectively compared the sex, age, smoking and drinking history, clinical stage, treatment, histopathological diagnosis, multiple primary cancers, and outcomes of the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 62 patients, 32 had the anterior type, while 30 had the posterior type. The anterior type was found more significantly in men (p = 0.01) and individuals with a smoking history than the posterior type (p = 0.04). pN2-3 cervical lymph node metastasis was significantly more common in the anterior type than in the posterior type (p = 0.01). The median depth of invasion in the anterior type was 4 mm. Multivariate analysis showed that the anterior type was an independent risk factor for multiple primary cancer development in FOM SCC (p = 0.02). The cumulative 10-year disease-specific survival rates of the anterior and posterior types were 92.8 and 95.0%, respectively, while the overall survival rates were 65.4 and 95.0%, respectively. In the anterior type FOM SCC, a lower overall survival rate was associated with multiple primary cancers and smoking-related diseases. CONCLUSION: Smoking cessation and adequate systemic screening for multiple primary cancers are needed to improve the prognosis of FOM SCC, particularly the anterior type.",

This study aimed to investigate the escalation of osteosarcoma stem cells' apoptosis after the co-cultivation with PBMCs sensitized by MSCs secretome with/or CSF-2 and it was completed by analyzing the level of serum tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level, annexin V binding, caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in vitro. METHODS: OS-SCs were derived from a single human osteosarcoma sample with its high grade and osteoblastic essential clinical characteristics obtained from a biopsy before the chemotherapy treatment. They were then isolated and cultured confirmed by the cluster of differentiation-133 (FITC) by applying immunofluorescence analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled. MSCs secretome was obtained with cells extracted from the bone marrow of a healthy patient. Furthermore, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was utilized to analyze sTRAIL and TNF-alpha level in each group. The expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, and annexin V assay in each group was examined by applying the immunofluorescence labeled with FITC. The comparison analysis between treatment groups and the control group was performed by utilizing the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and continued with Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) (p<0.05). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the upregulation of sTRAIL and TNF-alpha level indicated by the increased annexin V, caspase-3, and caspase-8 expression binding between groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: MSCs Secretome and CSF-2 could significantly increase the activity of PBMCs through the improvement of sTRAIL and TNF-alpha levels which could lead to the escalation of OS-SCs apoptosis through an enhanced expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and annexin V binding in vitro.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a critical event requiring adequate and timely response in order to increase a patient's chance of survival. In patients mechanically ventilated with advanced airways, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuver may be simplified by keeping the ventilator on. This work assessed the response of an intensive care mechanical ventilator to CPR using a patient manikin ventilated in three conventional modes. METHODS: Volume-controlled (VCV), pressure-controlled (PCV) and pressure regulated volume-controlled (PRVC) ventilation were applied in a thorax physical model, with or without chest compressions. The mechanical ventilator was set with inspiratory time of 1.0 s, ventilation rate of 10 breaths/min, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH(2)O, FiO(2) of 1.0, target tidal volume of 600 mL and trigger level of -20 cmH(2)O. Airway opening pressure and ventilatory flow signals were continuously recorded. RESULTS: Chest compression resulted in increased airway peak pressure in all ventilation modes (p < 0.001), especially with VCV (137% in VCV, 83% in PCV, 80% in PRVC). However, these pressures were limited to levels similar to release valves in manual resuscitators (~60 cmH(2)O). In pressure-controlled modes tidal/min volumes decreased (PRVC = 11%, p = 0.027 and PCV = 12%, p < 0.001), while still within the variability observed during bag-valve-mask ventilation. During VCV, variation in tidal/min volumes were not significant (p = 0.140). Respiratory rate did not change with chest compression. CONCLUSIONS: Volume and pressure ventilation modes responded differently to chest compressions. Yet, variation in delivered volume and the measured peak pressures were within the reported for the standard bag-valve-mask system.",

We observed fewer tumor foci in Ncf1 mutant mice, irrespective of alphabetaT, gammadeltaT, B-cell deficiencies, or of a functional Ncf1 expression in CD68-positive monocytes/macrophages. The susceptibility to tumor colonization was restored by the human S100A8 (MRP8) promoter directing a functional Ncf1 expression to granulocytes. This effect was associated with an increase of both ROS and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) production from lung neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophil depletion by anti-Ly6G antibodies increased tumor colonization in wild type but failed in the Ncf1 mutant mice. In conclusion, tumor colonization is counteracted by ROS-activated and IL-1beta-secreting tissue neutrophils.",

To handle such unexpected scenarios, this paper presents NOTA, a novel online teaching and assessment scheme that takes advantage of Blockchain technology to maintain the expected teaching quality and assessment fairness while respecting the courses' and examinations' schedule. Besides, NOTA also motivates both learners and teachers to persist in their endeavours, even from home, through Blockchain's incentive strategies.

        "abstract": "AIM: To identify factors influencing healthcare professionals' engagement in health behaviour conversations with patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Between April and June 2019, an online survey of 1338 nurses, midwives and healthcare support workers was conducted. The survey assessed whether staff felt comfortable initiating health behaviour conversations with patients about five behaviours (reducing alcohol intake; stop smoking; being more active; reducing their weight; and improving their diet) and barriers to conversation initiation. Health professionals' own health-related behaviours, self-rated health and mental wellbeing, and socio-demographic characteristics were recorded. Logistic regression models were built to assess factors associated with feeling comfortable initiating health behaviour conversations for each topic. RESULT: Less than 50% of respondents reported feeling comfortable initiating health behaviour conversations with patients. Female staff, young professionals (18 to 29 years), those in lower staff grades and those with poorer health and low mental wellbeing were less likely to report feeling comfortable having health behaviour conversations across all topics. Those who did not adhere to physical activity and dietary guidelines were less likely to initiate a conversation about being more active and having a healthy diet, respectively. Not having time to discuss the topic, suitable space to hold a conversation, and feeling worried about offending/upsetting patients were the main barriers reported. CONCLUSION: Around 6 in 10 members of the nursing, midwifery and healthcare support workforce in Wales potentially do not feel comfortable to initiate a health behaviour conversation with patients about health and wellbeing. Feeling less comfortable to initiate a conversation was associated with staff demographics and organizational factors. IMPACT: We identified those less likely to initiate health behaviour conversations as well as personal and organizational barriers to initiation. This will help to target and tailor interventions to ensure staff are equipped and enabled to hold health behaviour conversations with patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Sudden gains during psychotherapy have been found to consistently predict treatment outcome but evidence on predictors of sudden gains has been equivocal. To address this gap, the present study utilized three machine learning algorithms to predict sudden gains during treatment for major depressive disorder. METHOD: We examined predictors of sudden gains in two large samples of individuals receiving treatment in a partial hospital setting (n = 726 and n = 788; total N = 1514). Predictors included age, gender, marital status, education, employment status, previous hospitalization, comorbid diagnoses, and pretreatment measures of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms. We used three machine learning models: a Random Forest model, a Random Forest model with an adaptive boosting meta-algorithm, and a Support Vector Machine model. RESULTS: In both samples, sudden gains were identified and found to significantly predict outcome. However, none of the machine learning algorithms was able to identify robust predictors of sudden gains. Thus, even though some models achieved fair prediction of sudden gains in the training subset, prediction in the test subset was poor. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the use of a large sample and three machine-learning models, we were unable to identify robust demographic and pretreatment clinical predictors of sudden gains. Implications for clinical decision making and future studies are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency medicine (EM) residency programs have transitioned from traditional in-person to virtual synchronous didactics to comply with social distancing guidelines. This study explores the perceptions of EM residents and faculty regarding this new virtual format. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study at five EM residencies using a mixed-methods approach to investigate resident and faculty perceptions of virtual didactics. Institutions selected reflect different program lengths and geographic locations. Quantitative data measured on a Likert scale were summarized as percentages. Differences were calculated using Welch's t-test and chi-square, where p < 0.05 was significant. Open-ended responses were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Our response rate was 64% (n = 141) for residents and 48% (n = 108) for faculty. Fifty-one percent of faculty and 54% of residents felt that they were more likely to attend virtually than in person. Among residents, 77% felt that they were more likely to attend virtual conferences during vacation or elective rotations. Perceived retention of information from virtual sessions was perceived to be the same or better for 69% of residents and 58% of faculty. Residents felt that they paid more attention in the virtual format (29% vs. 26%, p = 0.037). Both groups missed the social interactions of in-person conference (86% of faculty, 75% of residents). Respondents from both groups felt that < 20% of total didactic time should remain virtual once social distancing recommendations are lifted. Qualitative analysis revealed recommendations from residents and faculty to optimize lecture style and interactivity. Decreased commute time and ability to multitask at home increased wellness for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: While benefits of virtual didactics were acknowledged, residents and faculty missed the social interaction of in-person conference and preferred < 20% of future didactics to be virtual. Further research should assess the difference in knowledge acquisition and retention between conference models.",

State lawmakers are a group with substantial power to address TDV and intimate partner violence (IPV) through policies including Civil Protection Order (CPO) statutes. Understanding the factors that influence how state legislators craft TDV and IPV policies and how those policies are implemented can lead to policy processes that better serve survivors. Past research suggests the level of gender inequality in a state may be an important influence on TDV policies. This study used a case study approach to compare the processes of adding individuals in dating relationships to CPO statutes in a subset of states (n = 3) with high, middle, and low levels of gender inequality. Results did not suggest that gender inequality was related to variation between states but rather that it was a larger factor that creates the need for TDV policies at all. Relationships between the state IPV coalitions and lawmakers and the historical moment that laws were considered emerged as important factors in interstate variation. Future research can build on these results by further exploring the role of gender inequality in policy processes with additional states or policies and by examining the factors identified here in greater depth. Implications for practice are also discussed.",

This longitudinal study (January 2017-December 2019) aimed to estimate carriage rate of meningococci among household contacts of meningococcal meningitis cases within Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Throat swab samples were collected at first visit from each person in households, twice a month for up to 2 months and subsequently on a monthly basis for a further 4 months. Altogether, 1125 throat samples were processed by conventional culture for the identification of meningococci. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study on meningococcal carriage in Nepal. The meningococcal carriage rate among household contacts was 15%. All carriers were aged 19 years or older. There was no statistically significant gender difference. The duration of carriage was 60 days. Twenty of 36 isolates belonged to serogroup A, and 16 were non-serogroupable (NG). Serogroups isolated from the same individuals did not change within the follow-up period. All meningococcal isolates over the past 38 years in Nepal that have been reported in previous studies have belonged to serogroup A. The detection of NG meningococcal isolates in apparently healthy household contacts clearly indicates the importance of vigilance through surveillance and periodic in-depth studies.",

To better understand the phenotypic diversity of this disease resistance in S. chilense and to assess the effect of plant genotype versus pathogen isolate, respectively, we evaluated infection frequency in a systematic approach and with large sample sizes. We studied 85 genetically distinct individuals representing nine geographically separated populations of S. chilense. This showed that differences in quantitative resistance can be observed between but also within populations at the level of individual plants. Our data also did not reveal complete immunity in any of the genotypes. We further evaluated the resistance of a subset of the plants against P. infestans isolates with diverse virulence properties. This confirmed that the relative differences in resistance phenotypes between individuals were mainly determined by the plant genotype under consideration with modest effects of pathogen isolate used in the study. Thus, our report suggests that the observed quantitative resistance against P. infestans in natural populations of a wild tomato species S. chilense is the result of basal defense responses that depend on the host genotype and are pathogen isolate-unspecific.",

There are and will always be outbreaks of infection from airborne diseases. Our objective was to assess the potential risk of airborne virus transmission during CPR in open-air conditions. METHODS: We performed advanced high-fidelity three-dimensional modelling and simulations to predict airborne transmission during out-of-hospital hands-only CPR. The computational model considers complex fluid dynamics and heat transfer phenomena such as aerosol evaporation, breakup, coalescence, turbulence, and local interactions between the aerosol and the surrounding fluid. Furthermore, we incorporated the effects of the wind speed/direction, the air temperature and relative humidity on the transport of contaminated saliva particles emitted from a victim during a resuscitation process based on an Airborne Infection Risk (AIR) Index. RESULTS: The results reveal low-risk conditions that include wind direction and high relative humidity and temperature. High-risk situations include wind directed to the rescuer, low humidity and temperature. Combinations of other conditions have an intermediate AIR Index and risk for the rescue team. CONCLUSIONS: The fluid dynamics, simulation-based AIR Index provides a classification of the risk of contagion by victim's aerosol in the case of hands-only CPR considering environmental factors such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature. Therefore, we recommend that rescuers perform a quick assessment of their airborne infectious risk before starting CPR in the open air and positioning themselves to avoid wind directed to their faces.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) belong to inflammatory rheumatic diseases, the group of conditions of unknown etiology. However, a strong genetic component in their pathogenesis has been well established. A dysregulation of cytokine networks plays an important role in the development of inflammatory arthritis. Interleukin 33 (IL-33) is a recently identified member of the IL-1 family. To date, the significance of IL-33 in inflammatory arthritis has been poorly studied. This research aimed to investigate the potential of IL-33 gene polymorphisms to serve as biomarkers for disease susceptibility and TNF inhibitor response in RA, AS, and PsA patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 735 patients diagnosed with RA, AS, and PsA and 229 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. Genotyping for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL-33 gene, namely, rs16924159 (A/G), rs10975519 (T/C), and rs7044343 (C/T), was performed using polymerase chain reaction amplification employing LightSNiP assays. RESULTS: In the present study, the IL-33 rs10975519 CC genotype was associated with a decreased risk of developing RA in females, while the IL-33 rs16924159 polymorphism was associated with the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy and clinical parameters for RA and AS patients. The IL-33 rs16924159 AA genotype correlated with higher disease activity and worse clinical outcomes in RA patients treated with TNF inhibitors, and AS patients carrying the IL-33 rs16924159 AA genotype had higher disease activity and a worse response to anti-TNF therapy. That indicates a deleterious role of the IL-33 rs16924159 AA genotype in the context of RA, as well as AS. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that IL-33 gene polymorphisms might be potential candidate biomarkers of disease susceptibility and anti-TNF treatment response in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.",

The objective of this study was to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review on how the use of sevoflurane affects seizure adequacy (seizure duration and postictal suppression index [PSI]) and circulatory dynamics in ECT. We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs that investigated seizure adequacy and circulatory dynamics in patients treated with ECT using sevoflurane (sevoflurane group) and intravenous anaesthetics (non-sevoflurane group). A total of 12 RCTs (377 patients and 1339 ECT sessions) were included. Sevoflurane significantly decreased the electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure durations in comparison with intravenous anaesthetics, whereas no significant difference was observed in PSI (EEG: 9 studies, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.11 to -0.38, p = 0.0002; PSI: 4 studies, SMD = -0.06, CI -0.13 to 0.25, p = 0.59). The use of sevoflurane in ECT significantly increased heart rate (HR) compared with intravenous anaesthetics (9 studies, SMD = 0.31, CI 012-0.51, p = 0.004). In the pre-planned subgroup analysis, sevoflurane significantly reduced seizure duration compared with other types of anaesthetics, including propofol, barbiturates and ketamine. Furthermore, it was found that the risk of adverse events in ECT with sevoflurane were not significantly different from intravenous anaesthetics (6 studies, risk ratio = 1.33, CI 0.95-1.86, p = 0.09), with agitaion being the most common adverse effects. The results of our study suggest that using sevoflurane for ECT significantly reduces seizure duration, increases maximum HR and brings about no difference in the adverse event risk compared with those using intravenous anaesthetics for ECT. Therefore, there may not be compelling evidence favouring sevoflurane use for ECT, except in cases where intravenous access is difficult.",

This paper outlines a systematic review to discuss the challenges of reproductive health management in the camps of internally displaced persons. METHODS: For this research, electronic databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Pro Quest, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library till January 1, 2020 were searched. A threestage screening process was used for the selection of literature due to PRISMA checklist. Finally, a thematic synthesis approach was applied to analyze the data. RESULTS: In total, 133 articles were identified; 11 articles met the inclusion criteria for entering the process of final analysis. The findings were demonstrated in six main categories of availability and accessibility of reproductive health services, sexual and gender-based issues, human rights, social and cultural issues, coordination and collaboration, and mental health issues. The remarkable result of this study highlighted that the main challenges are lack of access to health services, violence against women and lack of household education. CONCLUSION: Results of this systematic review present valuable advice for policy makers and managers to prepare and respond effectively and timely to reproductive health challenges of internally displaces persons. Disaster preparedness plans and contingency plans for maintaining and developing reproductive health in IDPs camps are recommended.",

        "abstract": "Radical new paradigms are needed to equip non-professionals and leverage community faith-based infrastructure to address the individual and communal wounds of war- and conflict-related trauma. Muslims in war-torn regions like Somalia experience high rates of trauma and posttraumatic stress; yet, lack of providers, potential stigma, and lack of integration with one's faith are substantial barriers to care. In this pre-post feasibility clinical trial (NCT03761732), mosque leaders implemented a brief, group- and mosque-based intervention, Islamic Trauma Healing, targeting trauma-related psychopathology and community reconciliation for trauma survivors (N = 26) in Somaliland, Somalia. Leaders were trained in a brief 2-day training, with supervision provided remotely via WhatsApp. This six-session intervention combines empirically-supported trauma-focused psychotherapy and Islamic principles, focusing on wisdom from the lives of the Prophets and turning to Allah in dua about trauma. There were large, clinically meaningful effects for PTSD (g = 1.91), depression (g = 2.00), somatic symptoms (g = 2.73), and well-being (g = 1.77). Qualitative data from group members highlighted how well the program was aligned with their Islamic faith, built community, and need to expand the program. These results highlight the feasibility of this non-expert, easily up-scalable mental health approach in war-torn Muslim regions and refugee communities. This program has the potential to provide a low-cost, self-sustaining, Islam-based intervention addressing the psychological wounds of war consistent with the IOM's call to develop novel approaches to address unmet clinical needs.

        "abstract": "The quantitative measurement of viscoelasticity of nano-scale entities is an important goal of nanotechnology research and there is considerable progress with advent of dynamic atomic force microscopy. The hydrodynamics of cantilever, the force sensor in AFM measurements, plays a pivotal role in quantitative estimates of nano-scale viscoelasticity. The point-mass (PM) model, wherein the AFM cantilever is approximated as a point-mass with mass-less spring is widely used in dynamic AFM analysis and its validity, particularly in liquid environments, is debated. It is suggested that the cantilever must be treated as a continuous rectangular beam to obtain accurate estimates of nano-scale viscoelasticity of materials it is probing. Here, we derived equations, which relate stiffness and damping coefficient of the material under investigation to measured parameters, by approximating cantilever as a point-mass and also considering the full geometric details. These equations are derived for both tip-excited as well as base-excited cantilevers. We have performed off-resonance dynamic atomic force spectroscopy on a single protein molecule to investigate the validity of widely used PM model. We performed measurements with AFMs equipped with different cantilever excitation methods as well as detection schemes to measure cantilever response. The data was analyzed using both, continuous beam model and the PM model. We found that both models yield same results when the experiments are performed in truly off-resonance regime with small amplitudes and the cantilever stiffness is much higher than the interaction stiffness. Our findings suggest that a simple PM approximation based model is adequate to describe the dynamics, provided care is taken while performing experiments so that the approximations used in these models are valid.",

To examine mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among U.S. adults on the basis of their classification as having a parenting role (i.e., unpaid persons caring for children and adolescents aged <18 years, referred to as children in this report) or being an unpaid caregiver of adults (i.e., persons caring for adults aged >/=18 years),( section sign) CDC analyzed data from cross-sectional surveys that were administered during December 2020 and February-March 2021 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative.( paragraph sign) Respondents were categorized as parents only, caregivers of adults only, parents-caregivers (persons in both roles), or nonparents/noncaregivers (persons in neither role). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for any adverse mental health symptoms, particularly suicidal ideation, were higher among all respondents who were parents, caregivers of adults, or both compared with respondents who were nonparents/noncaregivers and were highest among persons in both roles (parents-caregivers) (any adverse mental health symptoms: aOR = 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-6.2; serious suicidal ideation: aOR = 8.2, 95% CI = 6.5-10.4). These findings highlight that parents and caregivers, especially those balancing roles both as parents and caregivers, experienced higher levels of adverse mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic than adults without these responsibilities. Caregivers who had someone to rely on for support had lower odds of experiencing any adverse mental health symptoms. Additional measures are needed to improve mental health among parents, caregivers, and parents-caregivers.",

AIM: In the process of exploring childhood cancer parent and patient engagement in resource-limited settings, we highlight the challenges faced by Latin American survivors from El Salvador, Mexico, and Peru as they transitioned from receiving cancer treatment to life as a cancer survivors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Focus group discussions and interviews were performed as part of a larger qualitative study involving 10 low and middle-income countries in four continents regarding patient and caregiver engagement in childhood cancer treatment. We present the results of the Latin-American survivors and their experiences finishing treatment and life outside the pediatric oncology follow-up system. Themes regarding a) losing eligibility for pediatric surveillance and care, b) the importance of peer survivors, and c) the need for giving back were part of their stories. CONCLUSION: We suggest that given the lack of organized support from healthcare systems and providers for survivors' proper transition into adult-centered care, foundations and non-governmental organizations can provide transitional support, offer space for guidance/information, and work towards collaboration among systems for future integrated programs.",

This strongly limits the applicability of these 2D PHIP-NMR techniques in areas in which high-throughput analysis is required. Here, we present a combination of fast acquisition and nonuniform sampling that can afford a 10-fold reduction in measuring time without compromising the spectral quality. This approach was tested on a mixture of substrates at micromolar concentration, for which a resolved 2D PHIP spectrum was acquired in less than 3 min.",

This syndrome is unique as every patient is different and can have any permutation and combination of symptoms. In our case, the five-year-old male child presented with complaints of abdominal distension, fever, and bluish discoloration of limbs with even mild exertion. Radiological evaluation was diagnosed with a large atrial septal defect, cardiomegaly, partial pulmonary venous circulation, multiple small spleens on the right side of body, a large midline liver, malrotated bowel, inferiorly displaced kidneys, and two hemiazygos veins. The echocardiography and electrocardiogram too were consistent with atrial septal defect and right ventricular strain pattern. The reasons for this highly variable pattern are rooted in the genetically complicated process of lateralization with a strong link to the copy number variations. Due to the variable patterns, it is more efficient to report all the findings utilizing a step-by-step process of commenting on each and every individual organ, instead of classifying them under different categories based on atrial isomerism. This is important as any other way of classification predisposes to a certain bias.",

The specimens have thicknesses of approximately 200 mum and gauge widths ranging from 75 mum to 700 mum. Tensile tests are conducted at strain rates of 0.001/s and 1/s using tabletop loading apparatuses and digital image correlation (DIC) for strain measurement. For each test condition, the apparent Young's modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and strain hardening exponent and strength coefficient are extracted from the tensile tests. The true strains to failure are also assessed from fractography. Size, rate, and composition effects are discussed. For most properties, the statistical scatter represented by the standard deviation exceeds the measurement uncertainty; the notable exceptions to these observations are the apparent Young's modulus and yield strength, where large measurement uncertainties are ascribed to common experimental factors and material microplasticity.",

LncRNAs could circulate in the blood in a cell-free form and serve as promising biomarkers for various human diseases. Herein, we investigated the feasibility of using serum GAS5 as a biomarker for liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and whether promoter methylation was responsible for GAS5 down-regulation. METHODS: Serum GAS5 levels were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR in CHB patients and healthy controls. GAS5 promoter methylation was examined in LX-2 cells and cirrhotic tissues. RESULTS: Compared with the sera from healthy controls, lower GAS5 levels were found in the sera from CHB patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that serum GAS5 had a significant diagnostic value for liver fibrosis in CHB patients. Serum GAS5 negatively correlated with HAI scores as well as ALT values in CHB patients. GAS5 was additionally reduced in cirrhotic tissues, associated with its hypermethylation promoter. In LX-2 cells, transforming growth factor-beta1 treatment led to a reduction in GAS5 expression and an increase in promoter methylation. Hypermethylation of GAS5 was blocked down by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and restored GAS5 inhibited HSC activation including proliferation and collagen production. Further studies confirmed that GAS5 methylation was mediated by DNMT1. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that epigenetically-regulated serum GAS5 could serve as a potential biomarker in CHB patients. Loss of GAS5 is associated with DNMT1-mediated promoter methylation.",

The anticoccidial index (ACI) was evaluated, and the cecal developmental parameters (i.e., villus height, [VH], crypt depth, [CD], and VH/CD) were determined. The distributions of glycoproteins and goblet cells in the cecal tissue were determined through the Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue PAS staining methods, respectively. The mRNA expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 of the cecal tissue were determined through quantitative real-time PCR. The moderate ACI was obtained using the combination of Tol and RSF. Compared with the normal control (NC) group, the infected control (IC) group showed remarkably lower VH and VH/CD at five and seven days postinfection. Compared with the IC group, the IC + RSF and IC + TolRSF groups showed remarkably higher VH and VH/CD at five and seven days postinfection. Compared with the NC group, the IC group contained fewer glycoproteins and goblet cells, but the Tol and RSF treatment promoted more glycoproteins and goblet cells at five and seven days postinfection. The mRNA expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 in the IC group were upregulated (P < 0.01) compared with those in the NC group. The IC + RSF and IC + TolRSF groups had downregulated mRNA expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-17 cytokines (P < 0.01), and upregulated mRNA expression levels of IL-2 and IL-4 cytokines (P < 0.01) compared with the IC group. Results showed that the combination of Tol and RSF exerts anticoccidial effect by reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal mucosal immunity.",

        "abstract": "Osteomyelitis, as a severe bone disease caused by bacterial infection, can result in lifelong disability or fatal sepsis. Considering that the infection is stubborn and deep-sited in bone tissue, in situ and rapid treatments for osteomyelitis remain a significant challenge. Herein, we prepare an ultrasound (US)-activated single-atom catalyst that consists of a Au nanorod (NRs)-actuated single-atom-doped porphyrin metal-organic framework (HNTM-Pt@Au) and red cell membrane (RBC), which can efficiently treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-infected osteomyelitis under US. Besides the outstanding performance in the field of photocatalysis, we find that single atoms (such as Pt, Au, Cu) also improve the sonocatalytic ability of the sonosensitizer. Due to the strong electron-trapping and oxygen adsorption capacity, the Pt single atom endows RBC-HNTM-Pt@Au with an excellent sonocatalytic activity. It shows an excellent antibacterial performance with an antibacterial efficiency of 99.9% toward MRSA under 15 min of US irradiation. Meanwhile, the RBC-HNTM-Pt@Au can be propelled directionally under US and thus dynamically neutralize the secreted toxins. The MRSA-infected osteomyelitis in rat tibia was successfully treated, which shows negligible bone loss, reduced inflammation response, and great biocompatibility. This work presents an efficient sonodynamic therapy for the treatment of deep tissue infections via a multifunctional single-atom catalyst.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Resection of liver cancer involving the paracaval portion (PC) of the caudate lobe is challenging because the PC is located deepest in the liver. This study aimed to elucidate the utility of two parenchymal-sparing approaches of limited resection and central hepatectomy for resecting tumors located in the PC. METHODS: In 2018 and 2020, 12 out of 143 patients underwent hepatectomy for tumors located in the PC of the liver. In six patients, limited resection (LR) of the PC after full mobilization of the liver off the inferior vena cava (IVC) was performed for tumors excluding the hilar plate or large hepatic veins (large HVs), including major hepatic veins or thick short hepatic veins. In six patients, central hepatectomy (CH) using liver tunnel was performed for tumors involving or close to the hilar plate and/or large HVs. RESULTS: During CH, the surgical view of the cranial side of the hilar plate was wide enough to perform combined resection of the large HVs in front of the IVC. Five of the six CHs were performed with resection of the LHVs. No LRs were accompanied with resection of the LHVs. The CH was associated with longer Pringle's time (76 min vs. 29.5 min, p = 0.015) and blood loss (1104 ml vs. 370 ml, p = 0.041). The preserved liver parenchyma volumes were 82% and 95% of the total liver volume after CH and LR, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our parenchymal-sparing approach for resection of liver cancer located in the PC is feasible for curative resection.",

In the current COVID19 pandemic scenario, telerehabilitation has emerged as a substitute to the traditional face-to-face therapy, and is the only option possible in some cases. To subjectively assess the feasibility & acceptability of telerehabilitation provided by speech-language pathologist to patients of speech and language disorders. This qualitative study includes 20 patients suffering from disorders of fluency, voice, swallowing and neurogenic disorders. The participants included were undergoing face-to-face therapy at our institute. After the completion of face-to-face session series, telerehabilitation services were provided through a video calling app. The outcomes of teletherapy were assessed subjectively using a structured questionnaire on 11 parameters using a Likert scale. Of the included 20 patients, after completion of teletherapy, four patients chose the physical interaction as the preferred mode of therapy while 16 chose teletherapy as the preferred mode. Except three clients who rated their overall satisfaction as '3', others rated as '4' or '5'.The therapists were satisfied with the outcomes in 17 cases, and were pleased with the overall progress of all the clients (rated 4 or 5). Telerehabilitation is a reliable method to deliver speech and language services at community level, on long-term basis, as is proven by the high satisfaction scores among the clients as well as the service providers.

Both forms of the cytokine were secreted into the culture medium. The proteins' yield during cultivation in flasks was 100 and 60 mg/L for ryGM-CSF and ryGM-CSF-ApoA-I, respectively. Both forms of recombinant GM-CSF stimulated the proliferation of human TF-1 erythroleukemia cells; however, the amount of chimera required was 10-fold that of authentic GM-CSF to induce a similar proliferative effect. RyGM-CSF exhibited a 2-fold proliferative effect on BFU-E (burst-forming units-erythroid) at a concentration 1.7 fold less than non-glycosylated E. coli-derived GM-CSF. The chimera together with authentic ryGM-CSF increased the number of both erythroid precursors and BMC granulocytes after 48 h of incubation of human bone marrow cells (BMCs). In addition, the chimeric form of ryGM-CSF was more effective at increasing the viability of the total amount of BMCs, decreasing apoptosis compared to the authentic form. ryGM-CSF-ApoA-I normalized the proliferation, maturation, and segmentation of neutrophils within the physiological norm, preserving the pool of blast cells under conditions of impaired granulopoiesis. The chimera form of GM-CSF exhibited the properties of a multilinear growth factor, modulating the activity of GM-CSF and, perhaps, it may be more suitable for the normalization of granulopoiesis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyaluronan (HA) metabolism by chondrocytes is important for cartilage development and homeostasis. However, information about the function of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in HA metabolism is limited. We therefore profiled the role of the novel HA-related circRNA circHYBID in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: CircHYBID function in HA metabolism in chondrocytes was investigated using gain-of-function experiments, and circHYBID mechanism was confirmed via bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays. The expression of circHYBID-hsa-miR-29b-3p-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 axis was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. CircHYBID, TGF-beta1, and HA levels in cartilage samples were evaluated using qRT-PCR and pathological examination. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess HA accumulation in chondrocyte supernatant. RESULTS: CircHYBID expression was significantly downregulated in damaged cartilage samples compared with that in the corresponding intact cartilage samples. CircHYBID expression was positively correlated with alcian blue score. Interleukin-1beta stimulation in chondrocytes downregulated circHYBID expression and decreased HA accumulation. Gain-of-function experiments revealed that circHYBID overexpression in chondrocytes increased HA accumulation by regulating HA synthase 2 and HYBID expression. Further mechanism analysis showed that circHYBID upregulated TGF-beta1 expression by sponging hsa-miR-29b-3p. CONCLUSIONS: Our results describe a novel HA-related circRNA that could promote HA synthesis and accumulation. The circHYBID-hsa-miR-29b-3p-TGF-beta1 axis may play a powerful regulatory role in HA metabolism and OA progression. Thus, these findings will provide new perspectives for studies on OA pathogenesis, and circHYBID may serve as a potential target for OA therapy.",

        "abstract": "Chemosynthetic symbioses occur worldwide in marine habitats, but comprehensive physiological studies of chemoautotrophic bacteria thriving on animals are scarce. Stilbonematinae are coated by thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. As these nematodes migrate through the redox zone, their ectosymbionts experience varying oxygen concentrations. However, nothing is known about how these variations affect their physiology. Here, by applying omics, Raman microspectroscopy, and stable isotope labeling, we investigated the effect of oxygen on \"Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti.\" Unexpectedly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in anoxic relative to oxic conditions, but carbon fixation genes and incorporation of (13)C-labeled bicarbonate were not. Instead, several genes involved in carbon fixation were upregulated under oxic conditions, together with genes involved in organic carbon assimilation, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea utilization. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen, stress-related genes were upregulated together with vitamin biosynthesis genes likely necessary to withstand oxidative stress, and the symbiont appeared to proliferate less. Based on its physiological response to oxygen, we propose that \"Ca. T. oneisti\" may exploit anaerobic sulfur oxidation coupled to denitrification to proliferate in anoxic sand. However, the ectosymbiont would still profit from the oxygen available in superficial sand, as the energy-efficient aerobic respiration would facilitate carbon and nitrogen assimilation. IMPORTANCE Chemoautotrophic endosymbionts are famous for exploiting sulfur oxidization to feed marine organisms with fixed carbon. However, the physiology of thiotrophic bacteria thriving on the surface of animals (ectosymbionts) is less understood. One longstanding hypothesis posits that attachment to animals that migrate between reduced and oxic environments would boost sulfur oxidation, as the ectosymbionts would alternatively access sulfide and oxygen, the most favorable electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the effect of oxygen on the physiology of \"Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti,\" a gammaproteobacterium which lives attached to marine nematodes inhabiting shallow-water sand. Surprisingly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated under anoxic relative to oxic conditions. Furthermore, under anoxia, the ectosymbiont appeared to be less stressed and to proliferate more. We propose that animal-mediated access to oxygen, rather than enhancing sulfur oxidation, would facilitate assimilation of carbon and nitrogen by the ectosymbiont.",

First, we investigated direct associations of job demands and resources with teachers' professional well-being. Second, we tested two models of potential mediation for the relationship of job demands and resources to well-being using structural equation modeling techniques: (a) that psychological and physical well-being mediate the relationship between demands, resources, and professional well-being; and (b) that professional well-being mediates the relationship between demands, resources, and psychological and physical well-being. Although our sample of early childhood teachers (n = 262) reported high levels of professional well-being (i.e., work commitment, self-efficacy), a substantial number of them experienced challenges in both psychological (e.g., perceived stress, depressive symptoms) and physical (e.g., ergonomic pain) well-being. As expected, teachers' work-related stressors and work resources (positive work climate, quality of the physical environment) were directly associated with teachers' professional well-being. Contrary to our expectations, however, instrumental resources (i.e, wages, health insurance) did not predict any aspects of teachers' professional well-being. Our data only supported the first of the two tested mediation hypotheses (i.e., that psychological and physical well-being mediated the associations between working conditions and professional well-being), but with one caveat: physical well-being preceded psychological well-being in mediating the associations. These results advance our understanding of the challenges present in the early childhood workforce and have implications for policies and programs to improve teacher working conditions and well-being.",

This composite, with micron zero-valent iron (ZVI) as its core, is sulfurized and loaded by sodium alginate (SA). Some parameters affecting the Cr(\u2165) removal are also tested, including the type and mass fraction of chelating agents as well as S/Fe. SEM-EDS, TEM, XRD, and XPS are used to characterize and analyze the material. The results show that 7% Fe(3+) is most suitable as the chelating agent for sodium alginate, and a S/Fe ratio of 3.5 and drying temperature of 70\u2103 are the ideal formation conditions. The effect of SZVI-SA on the removal of Cr(\u2165) is in line with the secondary adsorption rate model, mainly affected by the availability of binding sites. The active ingredient was identified as FeS, and the specific surface area can reach 97.83 m(2).g(-1). Many pores, especially micropores, are present in this material and in addition to Cr(\u2165), SZVI-SA was found to effectively remove Cr(\u2162) and Fe(\u2162) from the test solution. Overall, the Cr(\u2165)-removal efficiency was 92%; the removal mechanism is mainly via redox reactions; and the main reducing active substances are Fe(2+), S(2-), and S(2)(2-). Following the reaction of Fe(\u2162) and Cr(\u2162), Fe(OH)(3) and Cr(OH)(3) are formed and Cr(2)O(3) precipitation separation occurs.",

However, there is an exception to this specific wiring in that rods also contact certain OFF cone bipolar cells, providing a tertiary rod pathway. Recently, it has been proposed that there is even more crossover between rod and cone pathways. Physiological recordings suggested that rod bipolar cells receive input from cones, and ON cone bipolar cells can receive input from rods, in addition to the established pathways. To image their rod and cone contacts, we have dye-filled individual rod bipolar cells in the rabbit retina. We report that approximately half the rod bipolar cells receive one or two cone contacts. Dye-filling AII amacrine cells, combined with subtractive labeling, revealed most of the ON cone bipolar cells to which they were coupled, including the occasional blue cone bipolar cell, identified by its contacts with blue cones. Imaging the AII-coupled ON cone bipolar dendrites in this way showed that they contact cones exclusively. We conclude that there is some limited cone input to rod bipolar cells, but we could find no evidence for rod contacts with ON cone bipolar cells. The tertiary rod OFF pathway operates via direct contacts between rods and OFF cone bipolar cells. In contrast, our results do not support the presence of a tertiary rod ON pathway in the rabbit retina.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of metastatic melanoma is increasing in all ages. Multiple trials with targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors showed improved survival in metastatic melanoma. However, patients aged >/=75 years are often under-represented in clinical trials, therefore raising questions on safety and efficacy of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a real-world cohort of 3054 patients with metastatic melanoma stratified for age (</=65 years, 66-74 years and >/= 75 years), and BRAF status, providing data on treatment strategies, toxicity, and survival. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox Proportional Hazard Models were used to present overall survival (OS) and Melanoma Specific Survival (MSS). RESULTS: Overall, 52.2% of patients were </= 65 years and 18.4% of patients >/=75 years. BRAF mutated tumors were found less often in patients >/=75 years: 34.5% versus 65% in patients </=65 years. Patients >/=75 years received systemic therapy less frequently compared to their younger counterparts independent of the BRAF status. When receiving treatment, no statistical significant difference in grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed. Three year Overall Survival rate was 13.7% (9.1-19.3) in patients >/=75 years versus 26.7% (23.1-30.4) in patients </=65 years, with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 1.71 (95%CI 1.50-1.95), p < 0.001. Three year Melanoma Specific Survival was 30.4% (22.0-39.2) versus 34.0% (29.7-38.2), HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.07-1.49), p = 0.005 with an adjusted HR of 1.21 (1.00-1.47), p = 0.049. CONCLUSION: Patients with metastatic melanoma >/=75 years are less frequently treated, but when treated there is no statistical significant increase in toxicity and only a borderline statistical significant difference in Melanoma Specific Survival was seen, compared to younger patients.",

Here, we disagree with Dr Breimer's characterisation of Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) related disability activism as a threat to women's autonomy and respond to the underlying assumptions of his claims. We argue that disability need not be equated only with harm. Instead, we point out the dominant and intractable belief that disability is something to be avoided, which may lead to belief-based moral wrongs. This is the position from which disability activists make claims about the need to expand understandings of disability. Drawing on existing evidence, we find that prenatal testing does not automatically facilitate autonomy, and that NIPT may be even more of a challenge to autonomy than previous testing iterations. We suggest that NIPT should continue to be a phenomenon under close clinical scrutiny, and that ongoing debates and multiple claims-making can only add to our understanding of this phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "In the healthcare domain, trust, confidence, and functional understanding are critical for decision support systems, therefore, presenting challenges in the prevalent use of black-box deep learning (DL) models. With recent advances in deep learning methods for classification tasks, there is an increased use of deep learning in healthcare decision support systems, such as detection and classification of abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Domain experts seek to understand the functional mechanism of black-box models with an emphasis on understanding how these models arrive at specific classification of patient medical data. In this paper, we focus on ECG data as the healthcare data signal to be analyzed. Since ECG is a one-dimensional time-series data, we target 1D-CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) as the candidate DL model. Majority of existing interpretation and explanations research has been on 2D-CNN models in non-medical domain leaving a gap in terms of explanation of CNN models used on medical time-series data. Hence, we propose a modular framework, CNN Explanations Framework for ECG Signals (CEFEs), for interpretable explanations. Each module of CEFEs provides users with the functional understanding of the underlying CNN models in terms of data descriptive statistics, feature visualization, feature detection, and feature mapping. The modules evaluate a model's capacity while inherently accounting for correlation between learned features and raw signals which translates to correlation between model's capacity to classify and it's learned features. Explainable models such as CEFEs could be evaluated in different ways: training one deep learning architecture on different volumes/amounts of the same dataset, training different architectures on the same data set or a combination of different CNN architectures and datasets. In this paper, we choose to evaluate CEFEs extensively by training on different volumes of datasets with the same CNN architecture. The CEFEs' interpretations, in terms of quantifiable metrics, feature visualization, provide explanation as to the quality of the deep learning model where traditional performance metrics (such as precision, recall, accuracy, etc.) do not suffice.",

However, knowledge of factors controlling ARG community assembly across seasons is still limited. Here, we revealed the seasonal variation of ARGs and depict the underlying assembly processes and drivers via high-throughput quantitative PCR in an urban lagoon, China. A higher richness and abundance of ARGs were observed in summer and winter compared to spring and fall (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.05). Both ARG and prokaryotic communities were mainly governed by stochastic processes, however, these processes drove ARGs and prokaryotes differently across seasons. Stochastic processes played a more dominant role in shaping ARG communities in summer (average stochasticity: 83%) and winter (75%), resulting in a stable antibiotic resistome. However, no such seasonal pattern of stochastic processes was determined for prokaryotes, indicating a decoupling of the assembly process of ARGs and prokaryotes. Moreover, fecal microorganisms (e.g., Bacteroidetes and Faecalibacterium) mediated the stochastic processes of ARG profiles, via enhancement of prokaryotic biomass and mobile genetic element abundances. The tnpA-07 transposase was the key for the horizontal gene transfer. These findings will enhance our understanding of how fecal pollution shapes ARG community assembly in urban lagoons.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The role of urodynamic study in the diagnosis and prognostication of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is still controversial. This study evaluated the correlation of the baseline voiding dysfunctions and long-term treatment outcome in patients with non-Hunner's ulcer IC (NHIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 211 NHIC patients were enrolled. All patients underwent videourodynamic (VUDS) examination at baseline to identify their voiding conditions and received subsequent treatments. The primary endpoint was Global Response Assessment (GRA) at the interview. Secondary endpoints included O'Leary-Sant symptom score (OSS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and the rate of IC symptom flare-up. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.8 +/- 12.8 years, and mean duration of IC was 16.0 +/- 9.9 years. At baseline, 83 (39.3%) patients had a voiding dysfunction and 132 (62.7%) had 1 to 3 co-morbidities. The duration, co-morbidities, treatments, changes in OSS and VAS, maximum bladder capacity (MBC), glomerulations, GRA and flare-up rate showed no significant difference among different subgroups. When we divided patients by their storage and voiding conditions, patients with non-hypersensitivity bladder (HSB) (n = 32) had significantly greater MBC (P = .002) whereas those with HSB with (n = 76) or without (n = 103) voiding dysfunction had higher glomerulation (P = .021). When we analysed voiding dysfunction subgroups by GRA, patients with a GRA of >/=2 had a significantly shorter duration of disease (13.9 +/- 8.6 years, P = .021). There were also significant associations between GRA and the changes of OSS (P < .001) and VAS (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: VUDS can disclose voiding dysfunction in 39.3% of NHIC patients. With adequate therapy, the voiding dysfunctions in NHIC patients do not affect long-term treatment outcome.",

METHODS: Sixty-two (53 men, 9 women) paramedics performed an array of (1) realistic reconstructions of critical job-tasks (criterion job performance); (2) simplified, easily-replicable simulations of those reconstructions and; (3) fitness tests that are portable and/or practicable to administer with limited resources or specialist equipment. Pearson's correlations and ordinary least products regression were used to assess relationships between tasks and tests. Performance on reconstructions, subject-matter expert and participant ratings were combined to derive minimum acceptable job performance levels, which were used to determine cut-scores on appropriate correlated simulations and tests. RESULTS: The majority of performance times were highly correlated with their respective simulations (range of r: 0.73-0.90), with the exception of those replicating water rescue (r range: 0.28-0.47). Regression compatibility intervals provided three cut-scores for each job-task on an appropriate simulation and fitness test. CONCLUSION: This study provides a varied and easily-implementable physical capability assessment for NARU personnel, empirically linked to job performance, with flexible options depending on organisational requirements.",

The purpose of this study was to examine how objective measures of dysphagia in people with Parkinson's disease influenced their caregivers' quality of life. Fifty caregivers (mainly spouses) of people with Parkinson's disease completed a caregiver quality of life survey. Results were compared to medical chart reviews, interviews, and instrumental evaluations of swallowing from the care recipients. Outcomes included caregiver quality of life score, ratings of airway invasion and pharyngeal residue, and Parkinson's disease duration. Descriptive and regression analyses were completed. All caregivers reported reduced quality of life, with 28% having severely disturbed adaptation. Every care recipient with Parkinson's disease demonstrated airway invasion and/or pharyngeal residue. Together, the combination of older care recipient age and longer disease duration was associated with poorer caregiver quality of life [adj. R(2) = 0.10-0.12, p = 0.03-0.4]. Neither airway invasion nor pharyngeal residue was related to caregiver quality of life (p > 0.05). Findings confirmed that caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease and dysphagia experience reduced quality of life; however, current methods of assessing caregivers' quality of life may not adequately account for dysphagia-specific burden. Results highlight the urgent need for the development of dysphagia-specific assessments of caregivers' quality of life to facilitate identification of high-risk caregivers and aid the development of support systems to improve health outcomes for caregivers and care recipients.",

Thalidomide is an anti-inflammatory agent that has been used in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of thalidomide and its underlying mechanisms on a mouse model of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI. Mice were injected with a single dose of glycerol (50%, 10 ml/kg, im) to induce AKI, and treated with thalidomide (40 and 80 mg/kg/day, orally) for 2 days. Renal tissue and blood samples were collected for histological and biochemical analysis. In thalidomide treated mice, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (59.3 +/- 19.6 vs. 223 +/- 33 mg/dl), plasma creatinine (0.58 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.3 mg/dl), relative kidney weight (0.93 +/- 0.13% vs. 1.22 +/- 0.1%) and histopathological damage (1.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.3 +/- 1.1 score) were significantly lower as compared to the glycerol group. The results also showed that the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) (0.13 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.01 microM/mg), myeloperoxidase (MPO) (0.1 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.02 U/mg) and the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) (1.7-fold), NLRP3 inflammasome (1.4-fold) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (3-fold) in renal tissue were significantly lower in thalidomide treated group than those in the glycerol group. Thalidomide treatment resulted in lower renal pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (6.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 12.3 +/- 1.2 ng/ml), interleukin (IL)-1beta (3.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.3 pg/mg), IL-6 (24.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 33 +/- 3 pg/mg) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (0.6 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.56 +/- 0.24 ng/ml) than those in the glycerol treated mice. In addition the levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (9.5 +/- 1 vs. 12.8 +/- 1.1 pg/mg) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (22.8 +/- 7.8 vs. 53.3 +/- 5.5 pg/mg) were significantly lower in renal tissue of mice treated with thalidomide as compared to the glycerol treated mice. In conclusion these data revealed that thalidomide may be a potential therapeutic approach against rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI through inhibition of inflammatory responses.",

        "abstract": "Cluster randomization results in an increase in sample size compared to individual randomization, referred to as an efficiency loss. This efficiency loss is typically presented under an assumption of no contamination in the individually randomized trial. An alternative comparator is the sample size needed under individual randomization to detect the attenuated treatment effect due to contamination. A general framework is provided for determining the extent of contamination that can be tolerated in an individually randomized trial before a cluster randomized design yields a larger sample size. Results are presented for a variety of cluster trial designs including parallel arm, stepped-wedge and cluster crossover trials. Results reinforce what is expected: individually randomized trials can tolerate a surprisingly large amount of contamination before they become less efficient than cluster designs. We determine the point at which the contamination means an individual randomized design to detect an attenuated effect requires a larger sample size than cluster randomization under a nonattenuated effect. This critical rate is a simple function of the design effect for clustering and the design effect for multiple periods as well as design effects for stratification or repeated measures under individual randomization. These findings are important for pragmatic comparisons between a novel treatment and usual care as any bias due to contamination will only attenuate the true treatment effect. This is a bias that operates in a predictable direction. Yet, cluster randomized designs with post-randomization recruitment without blinding, are at high risk of bias due to the differential recruitment across treatment arms. This sort of bias operates in an unpredictable direction. Thus, with knowledge that cluster randomized trials are generally at a greater risk of biases that can operate in a nonpredictable direction, results presented here suggest that even in situations where there is a risk of contamination, individual randomization might still be the design of choice.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) is a validated measure of neuromelanin concentration in the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA) complex and is a proxy measure of dopaminergic function with potential as a noninvasive biomarker. The development of generalizable biomarkers requires large-scale samples necessitating harmonization approaches to combine data collected across sites. PURPOSE: To develop a method to harmonize NM-MRI across scanners and sites. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: A total of 128 healthy subjects (18-73 years old; 45% female) from three sites and five MRI scanners. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0 T; NM-MRI two-dimensional gradient-recalled echo with magnetization-transfer pulse and three-dimensional T1-weighted images. ASSESSMENT: NM-MRI contrast (contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) maps were calculated and CNR values within the SN-VTA (defined previously by manual tracing on a standardized NM-MRI template) were determined before harmonization (raw CNR) and after ComBat harmonization (harmonized CNR). Scanner differences were assessed by calculating the classification accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM). To assess the effect of harmonization on biological variability, support vector regression (SVR) was used to predict age and the difference in goodness-of-fit (Deltar) was calculated as the correlation (between actual and predicted ages) for the harmonized CNR minus the correlation for the raw CNR. STATISTICAL TESTS: Permutation tests were used to determine if SVM classification accuracy was above chance level and if SVR Deltar was significant. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In the raw CNR, SVM MRI scanner classification was above chance level (accuracy = 86.5%). In the harmonized CNR, the accuracy of the SVM was at chance level (accuracy = 29.5%; P = 0.8542). There was no significant difference in age prediction using the raw or harmonized CNR (Deltar = -0.06; P = 0.7304). DATA CONCLUSION: ComBat harmonization removes differences in SN-VTA CNR across scanners while preserving biologically meaningful variability associated with age.

There is, however, a lack of information about suitable aeration and temperature for PN/A in single-stage reactors for high-strength wastewater, such as food waste (FW) digestate treatment. To this end, a laboratory-scale (10 L) partial nitritation/anammox sequencing batch reactor was operated for more than 230 days under four different intermittent aeration strategies and temperature variations (35 degrees C and ambient temperature - 26-29 degrees C) to investigate the feasibility of nitrogen removal from real FW digestate. High ammonium (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) removal median efficiencies of 81 and 63%, respectively (corresponding to median NH4+-N and TN loads removed of 76 and 67 g.m(-3).d(-1)), were achieved when the aeration strategy comprised by 7 min/14 min off and an airflow rate of 0.050 L.min(-1).L(reactor)(-1) was applied. Nitrogen removal efficiencies were not affected by temperature variations in southeastern Brazil. COD, chloride and organic nitrogen (520, 239 and 102.8 mg.L(-1), respectively) did not prevent PN/A. Changes of the bacterial community in response to aeration strategies were observed. Candidatus Brocadia dominated most of the time being more resistant to aeration and temperature changes than Candidatus Jettenia. This study demonstrated that optimizations of anoxic periods and airflow rate support PN/A with high nitrogen removal from FW digestate.",

It is also shown to significantly impact composition and dysbiosis of gut microbiota in both humans and animals. However, there is little information on the effect of high-fat diet on the development of pancreatic cancer or upon the gut microbiota of patients with pancreatic cancer in humans or animal models. METHODS: In this study, the effect of high-fat diet on cancer pathology and the gut microbiota was investigated by a carcinogen-induced pancreatic cancer mouse model. RESULTS: Compared with carcinogen alone, mice with high-fat diet and carcinogen showed more obvious pathological changes in pancreatic tissue; increased levels of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and carbohydrate antigen 242; and increased expression of cancer-associated biomarkers mucin-4 and claudin-4 in pancreatic tissue. Moreover, there is a significant change in the gut microbiota between the carcinogen group and the carcinogen with high-fat diet group. We identified that Johnsonella ignava especially existed in the carcinogen with high-fat diet group, which may contribute to pancreatic cancer development. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that high-fat diet changed the composition of the gut microbiota and was involved in carcinogen-induced pancreatic cancer progression.",

Such procedures warrant proper ventilation strategy and titration of potent short-acting anesthetics. AIMS: To compare propofol with the propofol-dexmedetomidine in conjunction with topical airway anesthesia in two groups during spontaneous assisted ventilation on peri-procedural hemodynamic stability. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was done on 40 patients who were randomized in two groups, 20 patients in each group; PS (Propofol+ Normal saline) and PD (Propofol+ Dexmedetomidine) group. All patients in both groups were induced with 1' IV propofol (1-3 mg/kg), IV midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), and IV fentanyl (2 mu/kg). PS group received propofol infusion for maintenance along with saline infusion 10 min before induction, whereas PD group also received propofol infusion for maintenance along with Injection dexmedetomidine infusion 10 min before induction. Outcome measured were heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and post-procedure awakening using Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAAS) scale and complications. RESULTS: In both the groups, MBP decreased significantly from baseline, however, when MBP were compared at the same time points between the groups there were no significant differences. In PD group, HR remained significantly lower when compared with baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 min time points when compared with PS group. Number of patients who developed hypotension requiring vasoactive drugs, their mean dose and duration of hypotension were more in PD group, and they awoke with significant delay. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol is better than combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine when given in adjunct with topical airway anesthesia for RB in view of early awakening, lesser duration of intra-procedural hypotension, and lesser requirement of vasoactive agents.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 affects persons living with HIV (PLWH) both directly (via morbidity/mortality) and indirectly (via disruption of HIV care). From July-November 2020, an online survey was conducted to investigate the psychosocial well-being of PLWH and changes in HIV care during the second semester of the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected on the socio-demographic characteristics of PLWH, their psychosocial well-being, impact of COVID-19 preventive measures on their daily routines and HIV follow-up. Of the 247 responses analyzed (mean age: 44.5 +/- 13.2 years; 73.7% male), 67 (27.1%) and 69 (27.9%) respondents screened positive for anxiety (GAD-2 score >/= 3) and depression (PHQ-2 score >/= 3), respectively. HIV care had returned to pre-COVID-19 state for 48.6% PLWH, and 108 (43.7%) had no HIV follow-up during the past month. Over three quarters (76.1%) of respondents expressed willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Compared to previous findings in April 2020, substance use increased from 58.6% to 67.2% (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that the well-being and medical follow-up of PLWH are still affected after almost a year into the COVID-19 outbreak. Remote HIV follow-up (telemedicine) with psychosocial support should be envisaged in the medium to long-term. Given that most PLWH accept COVID-19 vaccination, they may be prioritized for this intervention.",

This study evaluated the effects of increased short-term exposure to PM(2.5) constituents on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related emergency department (ED) visits and determined the susceptible groups. METHODS: This retrospective observational study performed in a medical center from 2007 to 2010, and enrolled non-trauma patients aged >20 years who visited the emergency department (ED) and were diagnosed as COPD. Concentrations of PM(2.5), PM(10), and the four PM(2.5) components, including organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), nitrate (NO(3)(-)), and sulfate (SO(4)(2-)), were collected by three PM supersites in Kaohsiung City. We used an alternative design of the Poisson time series regression models called a time-stratified and case-crossover design to analyze the data. RESULTS: Per interquartile range (IQR) increment in PM(2.5) level on lag 2 were associated with increments of 6.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-13.0%) in risk of COPD exacerbation. An IQR increase in elemental carbon (EC) was significantly associated with an increment of 3.0% (95% CI, 0.1-5.9%) in risk of COPD exacerbation on lag 0. Meanwhile, an IQR increase in sulfate, nitrate, and OC levels was not significantly associated with COPD. Patients were more sensitive to the harmful effects of EC on COPD during the warm season (interaction p = 0.019). The risk of COPD exacerbation after exposure to PM(2.5) was higher in individuals who are currently smoking, with malignancy, or during cold season, but the differences did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSION: PM(2.5) and EC may play an important role in COPD events in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Patients were more susceptible to the adverse effects of EC on COPD on warm days.",

As a therapeutic alternative that is part of a comprehensive care alongside medication, the Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music (BMGIM) music-assisted therapy has achieved promising emotional improvements in patients with chronic diseases. The objective of the study was to determine the impact of a treatment based on a BMGIM group adaptation on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and their emotional state, therefore analyzing state of mind, quality of life, anxiety, depression, immunocompetence as a marker of well-being, and levels of acute and chronic stress. METHODS: Longitudinal, prospective, quantitative, and experimental study including 43 patients with IBD divided into an intervention group (22 patients), who received eight sessions over eight weeks, and a control group (21 patients). A saliva sample was taken from each patient before and after each session in order to determine cortisol and IgA levels. Similarly, a hair sample was taken before the first and after the last session to determine the cumulative cortisol level. All molecules were quantified using the ELISA immunoassay technique. In addition, patients completed several emotional state questionnaires: HADS, MOOD, and CCVEII. RESULTS: An improvement was observed in the following states of mind: sadness, fear, anger, and depression. No significant effect was observed in state of mind in terms of happiness or anxiety, in the levels of cortisol in hair, and in patients' perceived quality of life. A reduction in cortisol was observed in saliva, although this did not significantly affect the IgA titer. CONCLUSIONS: BMGIM seems to improve the emotional state of patients with IBD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving haemodialysis (HD) are a vulnerable group of patients with increased mortality from COVID-19. Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. METHODS: There were two parts to this study. Between 15th March 2020 to 15th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. RESULTS: In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic and 25 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. Of the 22 patients in COVID-19 arm that underwent testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies beyond 7 months, all had detectable antibodies. A higher proportion of the patients with COVID-19 were frail compared to patients without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (64.3% vs 34.1%, p = 0.003). Other characteristics were similar between the groups. Over a median follow up of 7 months, a higher number of deaths were recorded in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to those without (18.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Serological testing in the HD population is a valuable tool to determine seroprevalence, monitor exposure, and guide improvements for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to help prevent local outbreaks. This study revealed HD patients mount a humoral response detectable until at least 7 months after COVID-19 infection and provides hope of similar protection with the vaccines recently approved.",

        "abstract": "Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can be used to assess and monitor psychological health following musculoskeletal injury. Studies have reported decreased psychological health after lateral ankle sprain (LAS) using numerous PROs. The purpose of this systematic review was to critically evaluate individual studies, summarize PROs utilized to quantify psychological health, and examine the effect of ankle injury on psychological health between groups (1 LAS, >1 LAS, and healthy controls). Databases searched included: CINAHL, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, APA, Psychinfo and PubMed Central. All case-control studies were critically appraised using the modified Downs and Black. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated between the groups (1 LAS, >1 LAS, healthy control) for each of the identified studies, for each included PRO used to quantify psychological impairments. Nine high-quality manuscripts were included. Overall, individuals with history of > 1 LAS self-reported greater psychological impairments compared to healthy controls (ES range = -0.37-12.16), while those with 1 LAS had similar psychological health to healthy control groups (ES rang e = -0.65-0.65). Conclusion: The main findings from this systematic review were individuals with > 1 LAS have increased levels of injury-related fear and decreased psychological health compared to healthy controls. PROs can aid clinicians in identifying psychological health concerns during rehabilitation.",

This study aims to assess the changes in the efficiency and productivity of the county-level traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and explore the possible causes of such changes. METHODS: Sixty one hospitals spanning from 2001 to 2017 were selected as samples in this study. And a slacks-based measure of super-efficiency in Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist index were used to respectively measure the changes in the efficiency and productivity. RESULTS: The scale of sample hospitals in Hubei continuously expanded from 2001 to 2017. The mean values of technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency in 2017 were 0.686, 0.74 and 0.933, respectively. The technical efficiency changes in 2017 was 1.97 times that of 2001, and the technological changes in 2017 was 1.45 times that of 2001. CONCLUSIONS: The medical environment and resources have been greatly improved due to the expansion of the sample hospitals, but the technical efficiency value indicates that the operation efficiency of sample hospitals still needs to be significantly improved. Decision-makers are advised to attach importance to the efficiency of operation management and consider the impact of multiple factors on the change in productivity.",

        "abstract": "Of Chargaff's four \"rules\" on DNA base frequencies, the functional interpretation of his second parity rule (PR2) is the most contentious. Thermophile base compositions (GC%) were taken by Galtier and Lobry (1997) as favoring Sueoka's neutral PR2 hypothesis over Forsdyke's selective PR2 hypothesis, namely that mutations improving local within-species recombination efficiency had generated a genome-wide potential for the strands of duplex DNA to separate and initiate recombination through the \"kissing\" of the tips of stem-loops. However, following Chargaff's GC rule, base composition mainly reflects a species-specific, genome-wide, evolutionary pressure. GC% could not have consistently followed the dictates of temperature, since it plays fundamental roles in both sustaining species integrity and, through primarily neutral genome-wide mutation, fostering speciation. Evidence for a local within-species recombination-initiating role of base order was obtained with a novel technology that masked the contribution of base composition to nucleic acid folding energy. Forsdyke's results were consistent with his PR2 hypothesis, appeared to resolve some root problems in biology and provided a theoretical underpinning for alignment-free taxonomic analyses using relative oligonucleotide frequencies (k-mer analysis). Moreover, consistent with Chargaff's cluster rule, discovery of the thermoadaptive role of the \"purine-loading\" of open reading frames made less tenable the Galtier-Lobry anti-selectionist arguments.",

A 16-year-old male presented with a 20 prism diopters residual right esotropia and intractable diplopia following Surgery and Botulinum Toxin. Having had further BT and surgery ruled out and no success with Fresnel prisms or occlusion, he commenced on standard orthoptic exercises without success. Additional orthoptic assessment discovered that the patient could achieve binocular single vision (BSV) on convergence at 10 cm. The patient then proceeded on a course of exercises to help extend this area of BSV. These exercises included a reverse dot card and a variation of the distance cat stereogram. Over the next couple of visits, the area of binocularity was extended to 30 cm and the esotropia measured 18 prism diopters. However, the patient felt that progress was slow, and they were keen to learn to drive and so opted for an occlusive contact lens instead. It is unfortunate that the patient did not continue with the exercise program as it showed potential to increase his area of BSV. However, this case does demonstrate how utilizing current knowledge concepts of both exercises and BSV, and adapting them to a specific patient could lead to improvement in the likes of intractable diplopia and be a potential management option.",

This study identifies symptom differences by bereavement status and validates a symptom model of bereavement. Symptom features from six national cross-sectional epidemiological samples were analyzed and estimates pooled. Crying often, thinking of death, appetite loss, waking up early, trouble sleeping, and depending on others were significantly more likely in the bereaved. Symptoms of thinking of or attempting suicide, feeling one would be better off dead or wanting to die, worthlessness, social conflict, worthlessness with difficulty making decisions, being discouraged, feeling less than others, being troubled, not coping, feeling hopeless, sleeping more, being upset and history of an anxiety disorder were all significantly less likely among the bereaved. Moderate to good model discrimination effect sizes were found. Good model performance was found when narrowly defined complicated bereavement cases were excluded. On the whole the bereaved are more likely to report symptoms consistent with a normal grief reaction. As depression screening becomes the norm in primary care, normal grief that meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5) symptom criteria for a MDE likely has a high risk of being diagnosed inappropriately as pathological depression.",

Accurately deciphering the fate of stem cells is the basis for understanding the mechanism and function of stem cells during tissue repair and regeneration. Cre-loxP-mediated recombination has been widely applied in fate mapping of stem cells for many years. However, nonspecific labeling by conventional cell lineage tracing strategies has led to discrepancies or even controversies in multiple fields. Recently, dual recombinase-mediated lineage tracing strategies have been developed to improve both the resolution and precision of stem cell fate mapping. These new genetic strategies also expand the application of lineage tracing in studying cell origin and fate. Here, we review cell lineage tracing methods, especially dual genetic approaches, and then provide examples to describe how they are used to study stem cell fate plasticity and function in vivo.",

However, little is known about the differences between incisor dental follicle (IF) and molar dental follicle (MF) during tooth eruption of rodents. This study aimed to investigate the differences between IF and MF during tooth eruption under induction with cervical-loop cells (CLC) and Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) cells of rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CLC, HERS, IF, MF cells were isolated from 10 postnatal day 7 rats and identified by immunofluorescence staining. CLC or HERS cells-derived conditioned medium (CM) was obtained to induce IF and MF cells. Cell proliferation, mineralization, gene and protein expression related to tooth eruption were detected, and histological analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The osteogenic differentiation and mineralization abilities of IF cells were stronger than those of MF cells. Both CLC and HERS cells-derived CM enhanced these abilities of IF cells, whereas they showed the opposite effect on MF cells. At 7, 10, and 15 d after birth, IF cells expressed more OPG and less RANKL than MF cells. CONCLUSIONS: IF and MF cells present distinct characteristics in tooth eruption, CLC and HERS cells have significant inductive effects on them.",

Owing to the poor bioactivity and maintenance of pro-angiogenic cells and factors during transplantation, new bioactive materials to tackle the barrier are highly desirable. Herein, we demonstrate a co-delivery platform for synergistic promotion of angiogenesis based on biodegradable, therapeutic, and self-reporting luminescent porous silicon (PSi) microparticles. The biodegradable and biocompatible PSi microparticles could quickly release therapeutic Si ions, which is bioactive to promote cell migration, tube formation, and angiogenic gene expression in vitro. To construct a highly efficient angiogenesis treatment platform, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was electrostatically adsorbed by PSi microparticles for effective drug loading and delivery. The dual therapeutic components (Si ions and VEGF) could release with the dissolution of Si skeleton, accompanying by the decay of photoluminescence (PL) intensity and blue shift of the maximum PL wavelength. Therefore, real-time drug release could be self-reported and assessed with the two-dimensional PL signal. The co-delivery of Si ions and VEGF displayed synergistic effect and highly efficient angiogenesis, which was evidenced by the enhancement of endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro with approximately 1.5-5 times higher than control. The blood vessel formation in vivo was also significantly improved as shown by the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, in which the total length, size and junctions exhibited 2.1 +/- 0.4, 4 +/- 0.4, and 3.9 +/- 0.3 times in comparison to control, respectively. The PSi and VEGF co-delivery system display great potential in tissue engineering as a biodegradable and self-reporting theranostic platform to promote angiogenesis.",

This article reviews the risk factors for unfavorable outcomes of LVNC in children, as well as discuss the diagnostic methods and the differences between pediatric and adult LVNC. Through a systematic review of the literature, a total of 1983 articles were outlined; 23 of them met the inclusion criteria. In echocardiography the following have been associated with adverse outcomes in children: Left ventricular ejection fraction, end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular posterior wall compaction, and decreased strains. T-wave abnormalities and increased spatial peak QRS-T angle in ECG, as well as arrhythmia, were observed in children at greater risk. Cardiac magnetic resonance is a valuable tool to identify those with systolic dysfunction and late gadolinium enhancement. Genetic testing appears to help identify children at risk, because mutations in particular genes have been associated with worse outcomes. ECG and imaging tests, such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance, help outline risk factors for unfavorable outcomes of LVNC in children and in identifying outpatients who require more attention. Refining the current diagnostic criteria is crucial to avoid inadequate restrain from physical activity.",

        "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection is one of the most severe vascular diseases. The molecular mechanisms of aortic expansion and dissection are unclear. Clinical studies have found that statins play a protective role in aortic dissection development and therapy; however, the mechanism of statins' effects on the aorta is unknown. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE52093, GSE2450and GSE8686 were analyzed, and genes expressed differentially between aortic dissection samples and normal samples were determined using the Networkanalyst and iDEP tools. Weight gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), functional annotation, pathway enrichment analysis, and the analysis of the regional variations of genomic features were then performed. We found that the minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCMs), a family of proteins targeted by statins, were upregulated in dissected aortic wall tissues and play a central role in cell-cycle and mitosis regulation in aortic dissection patients. Our results indicate a potential molecular target and mechanism for statins' effects in patients with acute type A aortic dissection.",

Here, the authors conducted an extensive retrospective analysis and review of the literature to elucidate the trend for CK use in the management paradigm for common neurosurgical diseases at their institution. METHODS: A literature review (January 1990-June 2019) and clinical review (January 1999-December 2018) were performed using, respectively, online research databases and the Stanford Research Repository of patients with intracranial and spinal lesions treated with CK at Stanford. For each disease considered, the coefficient of determination (r2) was estimated as a measure of CK utilization over time. A change in treatment modality was assessed using a t-test, with statistical significance assessed at the 0.05 alpha level. RESULTS: In over 7000 patients treated with CK for various brain and spinal lesions over the past 20 years, a positive linear trend (r2 = 0.80) in the system's use was observed. CK gained prominence in the management of intracranial and spinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs; r2 = 0.89 and 0.95, respectively); brain and spine metastases (r2 = 0.97 and 0.79, respectively); benign tumors such as meningioma (r2 = 0.85), vestibular schwannoma (r2 = 0.76), and glomus jugulare tumor (r2 = 0.89); glioblastoma (r2 = 0.54); and trigeminal neuralgia (r2 = 0.81). A statistically significant difference in the change in treatment modality to CK was observed in the management of intracranial and spinal AVMs (p < 0.05), and while the treatment of brain and spine metastases, meningioma, and glioblastoma trended toward the use of CK, the change in treatment modality for these lesions was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests the robust use of CK for treating a wide range of neurological conditions.",

All 1000 samples analyzed by real-time RT-PCR resulted negative. The 465 subsampled samples were analyzed by a commercial ELISA-Ab against WNV, and the 18.5% (86/465) positive samples were further analyzed by PRNT(75). In the PRNT(75), 13/86 and 2/86 horses were positive for SLEV and WNV, respectively. It was observed that 5.8% (13/226) of the farms presented at least one positive animal for SLEV in PRNT(75), whereas 0.9% (2/226) for WNV. Apart from the lower seroprevalences identified when compared to data previously reported in other Brazilian regions, our results suggest that public health professionals must be aware of the presence of these potential zoonotic pathogens.",

Because melanocytic lesions are frequently encountered in skin specimens, the use of IHC is likely to represent a significant area of resource utilization in dermatopathology laboratories. Our study investigates the rate of IHC utilization in the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions in a high-volume, government-funded, not-for-profit laboratory. Of the 1230 cases of melanocytic lesions investigated, including benign as well as malignant entities, 300 cases involved the utilization of IHC. IHC was used in a larger percentage of melanomas than nevi and in a larger percentage of melanoma in situ cases than invasive melanomas. SOX10 was overwhelmingly the most frequently used IHC.",

The aim of the present study was to analyze neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels in the urine, and to investigate whether it may be used as an early marker for renal involvement. METHODS: Forty attack-free children followed by diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever with age range of 5 and 18 years, and 38 healthy children with similar ages and genders were enrolled into the study. Hemogram, sedimentation, C-reactive protein, urine analysis, creatinine in the spot urine, microalbumin and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels were analyzed and evaluated statistically in the patients and controls. RESULTS: There was not any statistically significant difference between the patient and control groups for age, gender, height and body weight. Although there was not any clinical sign of attack in the patient group, sedimentation, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher than the control group (p = 0.002, p = 0.023, and p = 0.006, respectively). Similarly, urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level and urinary creatinine ratio were significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.0001, p = 0.011, respectively). We found a positive correlation between uNGAL level and uNGAL/uCr ratio and number of attacks per year in FMF patients (r = 0.743, p = 0.001 and r = 0.516, p = 0.001; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of significantly higher levels of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level to creatinine ratio were suggested as urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level as a non-invasive marker for renal involvement better than microalbumin.",

RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate showed no significant difference between the two groups. The regional control rate was also comparable between the two groups (P=0.490). The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was slightly better in the SLNB group than in the END group (P=0.427). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 89.9% in the SLNB group versus 91.9% in the END group (P=0.737).

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of hair loss, which can significantly affect the emotional and psychological well-being of patients. A systematic literature review was conducted to better understand the burden of AA from the patient perspective. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched for published studies (2008-2018) reporting on assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with AA. Qualitative, and quantitative data were collected. RESULTS: The review included 37 studies encompassing a range of clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools. None of the COA tools were specific for AA, and only one study used the Hairdex scale, which was designed to evaluate HRQoL in patients with disorders of the hair and scalp. All studies reported substantial impact on HRQoL due to AA, both overall and in domains related to personality (i.e. temperament and character), emotions and social functioning. Acute stress was also noted, and several studies identified lack of emotional awareness (alexithymia) in 23-50% of the patients with AA. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is well-established that patients with AA experience anxiety and depression, they also experience a decrease in HRQoL in many other areas, including personality, emotions, behaviors and social functioning, and these changes may be accompanied by acute stress and alexithymia. There is a need to achieve consensus on a core set of measures for AA and to develop and validate AA-specific measurement tools for use in future studies, to attain a clearer understanding of the impact of AA on patients.

Subjective measures showed those on both doses of triprolidine felt more refreshed on awakening versus placebo for the mean of all 3 nights, with no increase in daytime sleepiness. The frequency of adverse events was similar across groups. The optimum dose of triprolidine for treatment of temporary sleep disturbance was 2.5 mg.

Although placental COVID-19 infection has been documented in some cases during the second- and third-trimesters, no reports are available for the first trimester of pregnancy, and no SARS-CoV-2 protein has been found in fetal tissues. We studied the placenta and fetal organs from an early pregnancy miscarriage in a COVID-19 maternal infection by immunohistochemical, reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy methods. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, viral RNA, and particles consistent with coronavirus were found in the placenta and fetal tissues, accompanied by RNA replication revealed by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) positive immunostain. Prominent damage of the placenta and fetal organs were associated with a hyperinflammatory process identified by histological examination and immunohistochemistry. The findings provided in this study document that congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection is possible during the first trimester of pregnancy and that fetal organs, such as lung and kidney, are targets for coronavirus. The infection and multi-organic fetal inflammation produced by SARS-CoV-2 during early pregnancy should alert clinicians in the assessment and management of pregnant women for possible fetal consequences and adverse perinatal outcomes.",

        "abstract": "We are currently experiencing a critical period for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 related waste is a threat to global public environmental health. Medical waste management during this pandemic is one of the major issues facing public service organizations such as municipalities, which is of great importance in terms of logistics, environment and social aspects. The discussion of logistics operations is related to the collection, transportation and disposal of waste, which imposes high expenses. Many methods have been applied to develop and improve waste management policies in the literature. Apart from these studies, very few researchers have improved vehicle operations in waste management considering environmental aspects and the possibility of outsourcing. In this paper, by examining the gaps in the field, we try to explain and formulate the sustainable medical waste management problem for pandemics. Finally, by designing several practical examples with different scales, we solve the problem using CPLEX solver, compare different conditions and discuss the practical implications using the sensitivity analysis of demand parameter.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kidney transplant recipients are at risk for complications resulting in early hospital readmission. This study sought to determine the incidences, risk factors, causes, and financial costs of early readmissions. DESIGN: This single-centre cohort study included 1461 kidney recipients from 1 Jul 2004 to 31 Dec 2012, with at least 1-year follow-up. Early readmission was defined as hospitalization within 30 or 90-days postdischarge from transplant admission. Associations between various parameters and 30 and 90-days posttransplant were determined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. The hospital-associated costs of were assessed. RESULTS: The rates of early readmission were 19.4% at 30 days and 26.8% at 90 days posttransplant. Mean cost per 30-day readmission was 11 606 CAD. Infectious complications were the most common reasons and resulted in the greatest cost burden. Factors associated with 30 and 90-days in multivariable models were recipient history of chronic lung disease (hazard ratio or HR 1.78 [95%CI: 1.14, 2.76] and HR 1.68 [1.14, 2.48], respectively), median time on dialysis (HR 1.07 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.13]and HR 1.06 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.11], respectively), being transplanted preemptively (HR 1.75 [95% CI: 1.07, 2.88] and HR 1.66 [95% CI: 1.07, 2.57], respectively), and having a transplant hospitalization lasting of and more than 11 days (HR 1.52 [95% CI: 1.01, 2.27] and HR 1.65 [95% CI: 1.16, 2.34], respectively). DISCUSSION: Early hospital readmission after transplantation was common and costly. Strategies to reduce the burden of early hospital readmissions are needed for all patients.",

However, the impact of vegetation on BPA degradation in coastal sediment is still unclear. In this study, the differences of BPA biodegradation and the functional microbial community and metabolic pathway were explored between mangrove forest and mudflat sediments. A nearly complete BPA attenuation was detected in 4 days in mudflat sediment but 8 days in forest sediment. Bacterial abundance varied greatly in different sediment types. Bacterial community structure changed with BPA biodegradation, dependent on sediment type. During the degradation, the proportions of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were higher in BPA amended microcosms than in un-amended microcosms. With BPA biodegradation, a substantial increase in Novosphingobium and Croceicoccus occurred in forest sediment and mudflat sediment, respectively. Additionally, two divergent BPA biodegradation pathways were proposed based on functional annotation and KEGG pathway database. The abundance of functional genes also varied with BPA biodegradation, dependent on sediment type. Gene pcaGH decreased, while genes ligK and pcaD increased in both sediment types. Gene pcaB showed a remarkable increase in forest sediment but a decrease in mudflat sediment. Therefore, BPA degradation and the associated microbial community and metabolic pathway differed between mudflat and mangrove forest sediments.",

However, alpha-syn transmission in nonhuman primates, which are more similar to humans, has not been fully clarified. Here, we injected synthetic human alpha-syn fibrils into the left striatum of a macaque monkey (Macaca fuscata). At 3 months after the injection, we examined neurodegeneration and alpha-syn pathology in the brain using alpha-syn epitope-specific antibodies, antiphosphorylated alpha-syn antibodies (pSyn#64 and pSer129), anti-ubiquitin antibodies, and anti-p62 antibodies. Immunohistochemical examination with pSyn#64, pSer129, and alpha-syn epitope-specific antibodies revealed Lewy bodies, massive alpha-syn-positive neuronal intracytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs), and neurites in the left putamen. These inclusions were also positive for ubiquitin and p62. LB509, a human-specific alpha-syn antibody targeting amino acid residues 115-122, showed limited immunoreactivity around the injection site. The left substantia nigra (SN) and the bilateral frontal cortex also contained some NCIs and neurites. The left hemisphere, including parietal/temporal cortex presented sparse alpha-syn pathology, and no immunoreactivity was seen in olfactory nerves, amygdala, hippocampus, or right parietal/temporal cortex. Neuronal loss and gliosis in regions with alpha-syn pathology were mild, except for the left striatum and SN. Our results indicate that abnormal alpha-syn fibrils propagate throughout the brain of M. fuscata via projection, association, and commissural fibers, though the progression of alpha-syn pathology is limited.",

Positional cloning identified that slc20a1b, which encodes a sodium phosphate cotransporter, contributed to the smu07 blood phenotype. Further analysis demonstrated that mutation of slc20a1b affects HSPC expansion through cell cycle arrest at G2/M phases in a cell-autonomous manner.

Herein, the tribo-catalysis ability of zinc oxide (ZnO) has been investigated, which can realize the control of tightly-bound extracellular polymeric substances (T-EPS) in water under dark environment. The DFT calculation proves the Fe doping introduces the impurity level and decreases the work function from 5.071 eV to 5.045 eV, improves the charge separation of ZnO, and eventually enhances the catalytic reaction efficiency. Characterizing the catalytic reaction process by three-dimensional fluorescence (3D EEM) and fluorescence regional integration (FRI) method, it is found that the T-EPS solution can be degraded 75.8% by Fe-ZnO in 12 min, while ZnO can only degrade 32.2%. Combining with high-resolution scanning probe microscope (HR-SPM) and attenuated total reflection method (ATR-FTIR), hydration layers consist with hydroxyl layer ( approximately 0.23 nm) and water molecular layer ( approximately 0.27 nm) are observed at the interface between Fe-ZnO and T-EPS solution, and terminal hydroxyl group (OH(t)) is considered to be the active site for the generation of radicals.

The absence of high-level evidence to support the broad scope of perinatal bereavement practices means that offering a range of options identified as valued by parents has become an important indicator of care quality. This study aimed to describe bereavement care practices offered to parents across different high-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: An online survey of parents of stillborn babies was conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. Frequencies of nine practices were compared between high-income and middle-income countries. Differences in proportions of reported practices and their associated odds ratios were calculated to compare high-income and middle-income countries. RESULTS: Over three thousand parents (3041) with a self-reported stillbirth in the preceding five years from 40 countries responded. Fifteen countries had atleast 40 responses. Significant differences in the prevalence of offering nine bereavement care practices were reported by women in high-income countries (HICs) compared with women in middle-income countries (MICs). All nine practices were reported to occur significantly more frequently by women in HICs, including opportunity to see and hold their baby (OR = 4.8, 95% CI 4.0-5.9). The widespread occurrence of all nine practices was reported only for The Netherlands. CONCLUSIONS: Bereavement care after stillbirth varies between countries. Future research should look at why these differences occur, their impact on parents, and whether differences should be addressed, particularly how to support effective communication, decision-making, and follow-up care.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In ischemic stroke, treatments to protect neurons from irreversible damage are urgently needed. Studies in animal models have shown that neuroprotective treatments targeting neuronal silencing improve brain recovery, but in clinical trials none of these were effective in patients. This failure of translation poses doubts on the real efficacy of treatments tested and on the validity of animal models for human stroke. Here, we established a human neuronal model of the ischemic penumbra by using human induced pluripotent stem cells and we provided an in-depth characterization of neuronal responses to hypoxia and treatment strategies at the network level. APPROACH: We generated neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from healthy donor and we cultured them on micro-electrode arrays. We measured the electrophysiological activity of human neuronal networks under controlled hypoxic conditions. We tested the effect of different treatment strategies on neuronal network functionality. MAIN RESULTS: Human neuronal networks are vulnerable to hypoxia reflected by a decrease in activity and synchronicity under low oxygen conditions. We observe that full, partial or absent recovery depend on the timing of re-oxygenation and we provide a critical time threshold that, if crossed, is associated with irreversible impairments. We found that hypoxic preconditioning improves resistance to a second hypoxic insult. Finally, in contrast to previously tested, ineffective treatments, we show that stimulatory treatments counteracting neuronal silencing during hypoxia, such as optogenetic stimulation, are neuroprotective. SIGNIFICANCE: We presented a human neuronal model of the ischemic penumbra and we provided insights that may offer the basis for novel therapeutic approaches for patients after stroke. The use of human neurons might improve drug discovery and translation of findings to patients and might open new perspectives for personalized investigations.",

METHODS: Retrospective study of 290 consecutive subjects diagnosed with endophthalmitis at Auckland District Health Board between 1 January 2006 and 31 July 2019. Main outcome measure was visual acuity at 9-month follow-up and proportion of subjects with severe vision loss (</=20/200). RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 70.4 years and 151 subjects (52.1%) were women. Cataract surgery was the most common cause of endophthalmitis in 92 subjects (31.7%) followed by intravitreal injection in 57 (19.7%), endogenous endophthalmitis in 48 subjects (16.6%), non-surgical trauma in 42 subjects (14.5%), glaucoma surgery in 24 subjects (8.3%), vitrectomy in 22 subjects (7.6%) and corneal in 5 subjects (1.7%). Culture was positive in 136 (46.9%) with gram-positive organisms most common (76.5%). Early vitrectomy was performed in 82 subjects (28.3%). Median visual acuity at 9 months was 20/100 (IQR 20/30 to light perception), and severe vision loss occurred in 100 (43.5%). Retinal detachment occurred in 35 eyes (12.1%) and 26 eyes were enucleated. On multivariate analysis, younger age, poor presenting visual acuity and culture-positive endophthalmitis were associated with worse outcomes, and early vitrectomy was associated with better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Early vitrectomy (within 24 hours) is associated with better visual outcomes at 9 months, while younger age, poor presenting visual acuity and culture-positive endophthalmitis are associated with poorer visual acuity outcomes.",

The currently available approaches of knowledge-based and pattern-based artificial intelligence are unsuited to the iterative and often subjective nature of clinician-patient interactions. Furthermore, current electronic health records generally have poor design and low quality for such data mining. Bayesian methods have been developed to suggest multiple possible diagnoses given a set of clinical findings, but the larger problem is advising the physician on useful next steps. A new approach based on inverting Bayesian inference allows identification of the diagnostic actions that are most likely to disambiguate a differential diagnosis at each point in a patient's work-up. This can be combined with personalized cost information to suggest a cost-effective path to the clinician. Because the software is tracking the clinician's decision-making process, it can provide salient suggestions for both diagnoses and diagnostic tests in standard, coded formats that need only to be selected. This would reduce the need to type in free text, which is prone to ambiguities, omissions and errors. As the database of high-quality records grows, the scope, utility and acceptance of the system should also grow automatically, without requiring expert updating or correction.",

Specific features, including Krukenberg tumor and pseudomyxoma peritonei, are also discussed. CONCLUSION: Despite the growing knowledge of the macroscopic and microscopic features of ovarian mucinous tumors and the availability of a wide range of immunohistochemical antibodies useful in this setting, there still remains a group of tumors which cannot be precisely classified without close clinical-pathological cooperation.",

        "abstract": "Glandular trichome (GT) is the dominant site for artemisinin production in Artemisia annua. Several critical genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are specifically expressed in GT. However, the molecular mechanism of differential gene expression between GT and other tissue types remains elusive. Chromatin accessibility, defined as the degree to which nuclear molecules are able to interact with chromatin DNA, reflects gene expression capacity to a certain extent. Here, we investigated and compared the landscape of chromatin accessibility in Artemisia annua leaf and GT using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) technique. We identified 5413 GT high accessible and 4045 GT low accessible regions, and these GT high accessible regions may contribute to GT-specific biological functions. Several GT-specific artemisinin biosynthetic genes, such as DBR2 and CYP71AV1, showed higher accessible regions in GT compared to that in leaf, implying that they might be regulated by chromatin accessibility. In addition, transcription factor binding motifs for MYB, bZIP, C2H2, and AP2 were overrepresented in the highly accessible chromatin regions associated with artemisinin biosynthetic genes in glandular trichomes. Finally, we proposed a working model illustrating the chromatin accessibility dynamics in regulating artemisinin biosynthetic gene expression. This work provided new insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression in GT.",

        "abstract": "When gene regulatory networks diverge between species, their dysfunctional expression in inter-species hybrid individuals can create genetic incompatibilities that generate the developmental defects responsible for intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence can be hastened by directional selection through adaptation, sexual selection, and inter-sexual conflict, in addition to cryptic evolution under stabilizing selection. Dysfunctional sex-biased gene expression, in particular, may provide an important source of sexually-dimorphic genetic incompatibilities. Here, we characterize and compare male and female/hermaphrodite transcriptome profiles for sibling nematode species Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni, along with allele-specific expression in their F1 hybrids, to deconvolve features of expression divergence and regulatory dysfunction. Despite evidence of widespread stabilizing selection on gene expression, misexpression of sex-biased genes pervades F1 hybrids of both sexes. This finding implicates greater fragility of male genetic networks to produce dysfunctional organismal phenotypes. Spermatogenesis genes are especially prone to high divergence in both expression and coding sequences, consistent with a \"faster male\" model for Haldane's rule and elevated sterility of hybrid males. Moreover, underdominant expression pervades male-biased genes compared to female-biased and sex-neutral genes and an excess of cis-trans compensatory regulatory divergence for X-linked genes underscores a \"large-X effect\" for hybrid male expression dysfunction. Extensive regulatory divergence in sex determination pathway genes likely contributes to demasculinization of XX hybrids. The evolution of genetic incompatibilities due to regulatory versus coding sequence divergence, however, are expected to arise in an uncorrelated fashion. This study identifies important differences between the sexes in how regulatory networks diverge to contribute to sex-biases in how genetic incompatibilities manifest during the speciation process.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile is important for the development and assessment of infection prevention and control practices, as well as surveillance methods and interpretation of diagnostic testing results. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to longitudinally evaluate C. difficile shedding in neonatal foals and mares admitted to a referral hospital neonatal intensive care unit. ANIMALS: Foals admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, along with their dams. METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected from mares and foals at admission, and then approximately every 3 days, when possible. Selective culture for C. difficile was performed and isolates were characterized by toxin gene PCR and ribotyping. RESULTS: Clostridium difficile was isolated from 103/409 (25%) samples; 65/208 (31%) from foals and 38/201 (19%) from mares. Cumulatively, C. difficile was isolated from at least 1 sample from 50/113 (44%) foals and 30/97 (31%) mares. No association was found between hospitalization day and isolation of C. difficile (P = .13). Twenty-three different ribotypes were identified, with ribotype 078 predominating. Fifteen foals had 2 positive samples during hospitalization. In only 6/15 (40%) foals was the same strain identified both times (5 ribotype 078 and 1 ribotype 012). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Clostridium difficile is an important pathogen in adult horses and foals, and our findings highlight the complexity surrounding the epidemiology of this opportunistic pathogen. It can be found commonly, transiently, and cluster within a facility in the absence of identifiable disease occurrences or clusters.",

        "abstract": "The promise of crystal composites with direction-specific properties is an attractive prospect for diverse applications; however, synthetic strategies for realizing such composites remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic agarose gel networks can mechanically \"mold\" calcite crystal growth, yielding anisotropically structured, single-crystal composites. Drying and rehydration of agarose gel films result in the affine deformation of their fibrous networks to yield fiber alignment parallel to the drying plane. Precipitation of calcium carbonate within these anisotropic networks results in the formation of calcite crystal composite disks oriented parallel to the fibers. The morphology of the disks, revealed by nanocomputed tomography imaging, evolves with time and can be described by linear-elastic fracture mechanics theory, which depends on the ratio between the length of the crystal and the elastoadhesive length of the gel. Precipitation of calcite in uniaxially deformed agarose gel cylinders results in the formation of rice-grain-shaped crystals, suggesting the broad applicability of the approach. These results demonstrate how the anisotropy of compliant networks can translate into the desired crystal composite morphologies. This work highlights the important role organic matrices can play in mechanically \"molding\" biominerals and provides an exciting platform for fabricating crystal composites with direction-specific and emergent functional properties.",

        "abstract": "In ancient times, there were two types of &quot;Juhong&quot; came from the tangerines(Citrus reticulata) and the pomelos(C. grandis and its cultivars), which corresponded to Juhong and Huajuhong recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia respectively. In different periods, Juhong basically came from the same species and the same medicinal parts, but there were also some differences. This article sorted out the ancient and modern literature, under the guidance of &quot;Succession theory of Medicinal materials varieties&quot; and &quot;Change theory of Medicinal materials varieties&quot;(XIE Zong-wan), and combined with field investigation, the evolution and reasons of the original plants and medicinal parts of Juhong were analyzed. In the Han Dynasty and before, the peel of tangerines and pomelos were both used as medicine. In the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the way tangerine peel was used was dried and aged, and then &quot;soaked in hot water and scraped off the mesocarp&quot;, which had the essence of only using exocarp as medicine of Juhong already, and its original plant was C. reticalata. In the Song Dynasty, the name of &quot;Juhong&quot; and its medicinal usage were recorded in book on materia medica, and the species and medicinal parts of tangerine were inherited from the previous dynasties. The way tangerine peel was used was only dried and aged without removing the mesocarp. The medicinal material obtained by the way was called Chenpi(dried and aged tangerine peel). The item &quot;Juhong&quot; listing as a separate medicinal material was first recorded in the Collected Discussions from Materia Medica(Bencao Huiyan) in the Ming Dynasty. In the Ming Dynasty, the Dao-di habitat of Juhong was recorded as Guangdong province in most books on materia medica, and the original plants probably were C. reticalata and C. grandis 'Tomentosa'(Huazhou pomelo, a special cultivated species of C. grandis produced in Huazhou, Guangdong, which was recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as &quot;Huajuhong&quot;), according to the records in the local chronicles. During the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, the original plants of Juhong were C. reticalata and C. grandis 'Tomentosa'. Of the two, the latter one was considered as the better. As far the medicinal part, it was still the exocarp, while the whole young fruit of C. grandis 'Tomentosa' began to be used as medicine. After the founding of The People's Republic of China, the exocarps of Citrus reticalata, C. grandis and C. grandis 'Tomentosa' were listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia under &quot;Juhong&quot;. From the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Republic of China, C. grandis exocarp was a fake of Juhong. Therefore, it was contradictory to historical records that C. grandis exocarp was listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia as Huajuhong. Juhong had been divided into two types as &quot;Juhong&quot; and &quot;Huajuhong&quot; since 1985. The medicinal part of Huajuhong was only the exocarp of immature and nearly mature fruits, but not the whole young fruit, the actual mainstream medicinal part of Huajuhong. The results are helpful to clarify the historical evolution of species and medicinal parts of Juhong and Huajuhong. It is suggested that in the next edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, only C. grandis 'Tomentosa' should be included as the original plant of Huajuhong, and C. grandis should be deleted, and the young fruit should be added in the medicinal parts besides the exocarp of immature and nearly mature fruit.",

Although amphotericin B deoxycholate (dAmB) remains the first-line induction treatment, voriconazole can also be used. However, no clinical trials have compared dAmB and voriconazole in the administration of talaromycosis. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of voriconazole or dAmB as induction therapy for talaromycosis in HIV-infected patients. We enrolled HIV-infected patients with a confirmed Talaromyces marneffei infection who received intravenous dAmB (0.6 to 0.7 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks) or voriconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h on day 1 and 4 mg/kg every 12 h afterward) as induction therapy, followed by oral itraconazole as consolidation and maintenance therapy. Drug efficacy was evaluated based on response rate. Drug safety was evaluated based on the occurrence of adverse events. In total, 58 patients who received voriconazole and 82 who received dAmB were enrolled from two hospitals. The voriconazole and dAmB treatment groups had similar response rates at the primary and follow-up efficacy evaluations. However, the durations of induction antifungal therapy and hospital stay were shorter for patients in the voriconazole group than in the dAmB group. Few adverse reactions occurred in either the voriconazole or dAmB group. Our retrospective study indicated that voriconazole is an effective and safe induction antifungal drug for HIV-associated disseminated talaromycosis. The duration of induction treatment with voriconazole was shorter, indicating its potential as a better choice in clinical practice. The duration of voriconazole induction therapy is 11 to 13 days.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock (AMICS) is associated with high mortality. Patients >/=75 years old represent an increasing proportion of those who present with AMICS and are at high risk for adverse outcomes. METHODS: The National Cardiogenic Shock Initiative includes patients with AMICS treated using a standard shock protocol with early invasive hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical circulatory support (MCS), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We evaluated the outcomes of patients based on their age group, dividing them into <75 and >/=75 years old. RESULTS: We included 300 consecutive patients: 238 were <75 years old (79.3%) and 62 patients >/=75 years old. There were significant differences in survival; patients <75 years old had a 75.6% survival, while those >/=75 years old had a 50% survival (adjusted OR: 10.4, P = 0.001). SCAI shock classification impacted survival as well; those <75 years old with class C or D shock had a survival of 84%, compared with 57% in those >/=75 years old. Patients >/=75 years old requiring 1 or 2 vasopressors had significantly lower survival rates (36% and 25%, respectively) when compared with patients <75 years old (76.7% with 1 and 60.5% with >1 vasopressor). CONCLUSIONS: Age is inversely proportional to survival; patients <75 years old have high rates of survival if treated using best practices with invasive hemodynamic monitoring, early MCS, and PCI. However, using a standardized protocol can improve survival in the elderly; therefore, age on its own should not be a reason to withhold PCI or MCS use.",

These linkages may contribute to the potential toxicity mechanisms of environmental chemicals. Here, we investigated the epigenetic pulmonary response of hexanal, a major indoor irritant, following inhalation exposure in F-344 rats. METHODS: Based on DNA methylation profiling in gene promoter regions, we identified hexanal-characterized methylated sites and target genes using an unpaired t-test with a fold-change cutoff of >/= 3.0 and a p-value < 0.05. We also conducted an integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data to identify core anti-correlated target genes of hexanal exposure. To further investigate the potential key biological processes and pathways of core DNA methylated target genes, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-six dose-dependent methylated genes and anti-correlated target genes of DNA methylation and mRNA in lung tissue of hexanal exposed F-344 rats were identified. These genes were involved in diverse biological processes such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, protein kinase cascade, and intracellular signaling cascade associated with pulmonary toxicity. These results suggest that novel DNA methylation-based epigenetic biomarkers of exposure to hexanal and elucidate the potential pulmonary toxicological mechanisms of action of hexanal.",

In total, 18 patients who underwent IMRT for supratentorial tumors were analyzed. Prescribed doses of IMRT in 30 fractions were 60 Gy to planning target volume (PTV) 1 of the local area and 48-51 Gy to PTV2 of the extended local area. Based on previous literature, the present study investigated dose-volume parameters of the bilateral hippocampi: D(40%) of 13.1 Gy, D(50%) of 29.6 Gy, and V(55Gy) of 5.0%. It was evaluated which of the parameters was most achievable, and unfavorable factors that interfere with reaching these parameters were identified. As a result, D(40%) of 13.1 Gy, D(50%) of 29.6 Gy and V(55Gy) of 5.0% were achieved in 17, 67 and 33% of patients, respectively. For D(50%) of 29.6 Gy, PTV2 >/=500 cc (P=0.004) and tumor in temporal/corpus callosum/basal ganglia (P=0.009) were significant unfavorable factors. In conclusion, D(50%) of 29.6 Gy was most achievable. In daily clinical practice, it should be primarily attempted to achieve D(50%) of 29.6 Gy of the bilateral hippocampi.",

Liver support therapies can be applied as a bridging-to-transplantation or bridging-to-recovery; however, results of clinical trials are controversial. Our aim was to compare liver support systems in acute and hyperacute liver failure with network meta-analysis. After systematic search, randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing liver support therapies in adults with acute or hyperacute liver failure were included. In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome, the secondary outcomes were hepatic encephalopathy and mortality-by-aetiology. A Bayesian-method was used to perform network meta-analysis and calculate surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values to rank interventions. Eleven RCTs were included. BioLogic-DT and molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) resulted in the lowest mortality (SUCRAs: 76% and 73%, respectively). In non-paracetamol-poisoned patients, BioLogic-DT, charcoal hemoperfusion and MARS may be equally efficient regarding mortality (SUCRAs: 53%, 52% and 52%, respectively). Considering hepatic encephalopathy, extracorporeal liver assist device (ELAD) may be the most effective option (SUCRA: 78%). However, in pairwise meta-analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between the interventions in the outcomes. In conclusion, MARS therapy seems to be the best available option in reducing mortality. Further research is needed on currently available and new therapeutic modalities. (CRD42020160133).",

The long-term control model is first studied, and the existence and stability of the wild mosquito-extinction periodic solution are exploited. Thresholds of the release amount and release period which can guarantee the elimination of the wild mosquitos are obtained. Then for the limited-time control model, three different optimal strategies in impulsive control are investigated. By applying a time rescaling technique and an optimization algorithm based on gradient, the optimal impulsive release timings and amounts of sterile mosquitoes are obtained. Our results show that the optimal selection of release timing is more important than the optimal selection of release amount, while mixed optimal control has the best comprehensive effect.",

It can lead to persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage resulting in significant secondary complications. Here, we present a case in which the cauda equina herniated into a pseudomeningocele that penetrated a facet joint, leading to lower extremity radiculopathy warranting surgical correction. CASE DESCRIPTION: One year ago, a 67-year-old male underwent a partial left L4-L5 laminectomy. At surgery, a durotomy was repaired with a nylon suture and reinforced with a fat patch. He subsequently presented with severe left lower extremity radiculopathy and a partial cauda equina syndrome. On MR, the cauda equina had herniated into a pseudomeningocele that penetrated the left facet joint. Once the defect was repaired at surgery, the patient's symptoms improved. CONCLUSION: It is critical to correctly repair an intraoperative durotomy to avoid further neurological deficits that may include cauda equina herniation into pseudomeningoceles penetrating facet joints.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: Little is known about the relative importance of body volume and haemodynamic parameters in the development of worsening of renal function in acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF). To study the relationship between haemodynamic parameters, body water content and worsening of renal function in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) hospitalised for ADHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective observational study involved 51 consecutive patients with HFrEF (age: 73+/-14 years, male: 60%, left ventricular ejection fraction: 33.3%+/-9.9%) hospitalised for ADHF. Echocardiographic-determined haemodynamic parameters and body volume determined using a bioelectric impedance analyser were serially obtained. All patients received intravenous furosemide 160 mg/day for 3 days. There was a mean weight loss of 3.95+/-2.82 kg (p<0.01), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) reduced from 1380+/-901 pg/mL to 797+/-738 pg/mL (p<0.01). Nonetheless serum creatinine (SCr) increased from 134+/-46 mumol/L to 151+/-53 mumol/L (p<0.01), and 35% of patients developed worsening of renal function. The change in SCr was positively correlated with age (r=0.34, p=0.017); and negatively with the ratio of extracellular water to total body water, a parameter of body volume status (r=-0.58, p<0.001); E:E' ratio (r=-0.36, p=0.01); right ventricular systolic pressure (r=-0.40, p=0.009); and BNP (r=-0.40, p=0.004). Counterintuitively, no correlation was observed between SCr and cardiac output, or total peripheral vascular resistance. Regression analysis revealed that normal body volume and lower BNP independently predicted worsening of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: Normal body volume and lower serum BNP on admission were associated with worsening of renal function in patients with HFrEF hospitalised for ADHF.",

Thyroid carcinomas are frequent endocrine cancers, and several evidences suggest that they are correlated with obesity. In this study, we first analyzed the expression levels and prognostic values of Acrp30, leptin, and their receptors in thyroid cancer cells. Then, we investigated the role of Acrp30 and leptin in proliferation, migration, and invasion. We found that Acrp30 treatment alone inhibits cell proliferation and cell viability in a time and dose-dependent manner; leptin alone does not influence thyroid cancer cells (BCPAP and K1) proliferation, but the combined treatment reverts Acrp30-induced effects on cell proliferation. Additionally, through wound healing and Matrigel Matrix invasion assays, we unveiled that Acrp30 inhibits thyroid cancer cell motility, while leptin induces the opposite effect. Importantly, in the combined treatment, Acrp30 and leptin exert antagonizing effects on papillary thyroid cancer cells' migration and invasion in both BCPAP and K1 cell lines. Highlights of these studies suggest that Acrp30 and leptin could represent therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the management of thyroid cancer.",

        "abstract": "The addition of iodine to edible salt has been one of the most important public health successes of the past half century, enabling most countries to achieve optimal iodine intake and protect the brains of unborn children from the adverse consequences of iodine deficiency. Salt has been an ideal vehicle for this effort because of its near universal and narrow range of consumption, relative ease of technology for salt iodization, and capacity for virtually all salt producers to add iodine. As a result of the success of salt iodization, there has been growing interest in using salt as a vehicle for other important micronutrients, particularly the addition of iron to iodized salt to produce double-fortified salt (DFS), to combat the persistent problem of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of this growing interest in DFS and the need for a comprehensive review of evidence to support the viability of this intervention, the Iodine Global Network (IGN) initiated a global consultation to gather all available data on different aspects of DFS. IGN identified 4 key areas considered essential to understand for a successful fortification intervention: 1) efficacy and effectiveness, or how well DFS produces a health impact in controlled and real-life settings; 2) technical considerations for production, or what are the minimum requirements to manufacture DFS; 3) program implementation to describe experiences thus far with the delivery of DFS across multiple platforms; and 4) comparison of DFS with other iron fortification efforts to determine the comparative advantage of DFS to improve iron intake and prevent iron deficiency anemia. This preface provides an overview of the DFS Consultation objectives, process, and objectives.",

        "abstract": "The carnivorous pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes usually attract, capture and digest arthropod prey to obtain mineral nutrients. But few members of the genus have evolved specialized nutrient sequestration strategies to acquire nitrogen from the faeces and urine of mutualistic mammals, which they attract. Because the plants obtain significant amounts of nitrogen in a more available form, we hypothesized that they have relaxed the production of digestive enzymes. If so, species that digest mammal faeces should show fewer digestive enzymes than closely related species that rely on arthropods. We tested this hypothesis by comparing digestive enzymes in 1) Nepenthes hemsleyana, whose pitchers serve as roosts for the mutualistic woolly bat Kerivoula hardwickii, which also defecate inside the pitchers, and 2) the close relative Nepenthes rafflesiana, a typical arthropod capturing species. To investigate the dynamics of aspartic proteases (nepenthesin I and II) and type III and IV chitinases in both species, we conducted qPCR, western blotting, mass spectrometry, and enzyme activity measurements. We found that mRNA in pitcher tissue and enzyme abundance in the digestive fluid is upregulated in both species in response to faeces and insect feeding. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the final nepenthesin proteolytic activity in the digestive fluid is higher in response to faeces addition than to insect prey irrespective of Nepenthes species. This indicates that faeces can mimic arthropod prey triggering the production of digestive enzymes and N. hemsleyana retained capacity for production of them.",

        "abstract": "Thaumatotibia leucotreta, known as the false codling moth, is a pest of citrus and other crops in sub-Saharan Africa. As it is endemic to this region and as South Africa exports most of its citrus around the world, T. leucotreta has phytosanitary status for most markets. This means that there is zero tolerance for any infestation with live larvae in the market. Consequently, control measures prior to exporting must be exemplary. Certain markets require a standalone postharvest disinfestation treatment for T. leucotreta. However, the European Union accepts a systems approach, consisting of three measures and numerous components within these measures. Although effective preharvest control measures are important under all circumstances, they are most critical where a standalone postharvest disinfestation treatment is not applied, such as within a systems approach. Conventional wisdom may lead a belief that effective chemical control tools are imperative to achieve this end. However, we demonstrate that it is possible to effectively control T. leucotreta to a level acceptable for a phytosanitary market, using only biological control tools. This includes parasitoids, predators, microbial control, semiochemicals, and sterile insects. Simultaneously, on-farm and environmental safety is improved and compliance with the increasing stringency of chemical residue requirements imposed by markets is achieved.",

Five anonymized full-body CT imaging sets were used. A script was developed to automate and standardize the treatment planning process using the Varian Eclipse v15.6 Scripting API. The script generates two treatment plans: a head-first VMAT-based plan for upper body coverage using four isocenters and a total of eight full arcs; and a feet-first AP/PA plan with three isocenters that covers the lower extremities of the patient. PTV was the entire body cropped 5 mm from the patient surface and extended 3 mm into the lungs and kidneys. Two plans were generated for each case: one to a total dose of 1200 cGy in 8 fractions and a second one to a total dose of 1320 cGy in 8 fractions. Plans were calculated using the AAA algorithm and 6 MV photon energy. One plan was created and delivered to an anthropomorphic phantom containing 12 OSLDs for in-vivo dose verification. For the plans prescribed to 1200 cGy total dose the following dosimetric results were achieved: median PTV V100% = 94.5%; median PTV D98% = 89.9%; median lungs Dmean = 763 cGy; median left kidney Dmean = 1058 cGy; and median right kidney Dmean = 1051 cGy. For the plans prescribed to 1320 cGy total dose the following dosimetric results were achieved: median PTV V100% = 95.0%; median PTV D98% = 88.7%; median lungs Dmean = 798 cGy; median left kidney Dmean = 1059 cGy; and median right kidney Dmean = 1064 cGy. Maximum dose objective was met for all cases. The dose deviation between the treatment planning dose and the dose measured by the OSLDs was within +/-4%. In summary, we have demonstrated that scripting can produce high-quality plans based on predefined dose objectives and can decrease planning time by automatic target and optimization contours generation, plan creation, field and isocenter placement, and optimization objectives setup.",

The current study aims to study the antioxidant and prooxidant effect of Chlorella vulgaris cultivated under various conc. of copper ions. METHODS: The axenic green microalgal culture of Chlorella vulgaris was subjected to copper stress conditions (0.00, 0.079, 0.158, 0.316 and 0.632 mg/L). The growth rate was measured at OD(680) nm and by dry weight (DW). Moreover, the Antioxidant activity against DPPH and ABTS radical, pigments and phytochemical compounds of the crude extracts (methylene chloride: Methanol, 1:1) were evaluated. The promising Cu crude extract (0.316 mg/L) further fractionated into twenty-one fractions by silica gel column chromatography using hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate as a mobile phase. RESULTS: The obtained results reported that nine out of these fractions exhibited more than 50% antioxidant activity and anticancer activity against Hela cancer cell lines. Based on IC(50), fraction No. 7 was found to be the most effective fraction possessing a significant increase in both antioxidant and anticancer potency. Separation of active compound (s) in fraction No 7 was performed using precoated silica gel plates (TLC F(254)) with ethyl acetate: hexane (9:1 v/v) as mobile phase. Confirmation of active compound separation was achieved by two-dimensional TLC and visualization of the separated compound by UV lamp. The complete identification of the separated active compound was performed by UV- Vis- spectrophotometric absorption, IR, MS, H(1)-NMRT C(13)-NMR. The isolated compound ((2E,7R,11R)-3,7,11,15-Tetramethyl-2-hexadecenol) have high antioxidant activity with IC(50) (10.59 mug/ml) against DPPH radical assay and comparable to the capacities of the positive controls, Butylated hydroxy toluene [BHT] (IC(50) 11.2 mug/ml) and Vitamin C (IC(50) 12.9 mug/ml). Furthermore, pure isolated compound exhibited a potent anticancer activity against Hela cell line with IC(50) (4.38 mug/ml) compared to Doxorubicin (DOX) as synthetic drug (13.3 mug/ml). In addition, the interaction of the pure compound with Hela cancer cell line and gene expression were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend cultivation of Chlorella vulgaris in large scale under various stress conditions for use the crude extracts and semi purified fractions for making a pharmaco-economic value in Egypt and other countries.",

We find an occurrence of peaks instead of the typical steplike function associated with a quantum well, that rule out a free in-plane electron motion, in agreement with the theoretical density of states. This finding, along with the detection of deep trap states located on the edge facets, which also restrict the electron motion, provides a detailed picture of the actual lateral confinement in quantum wells with finite length and width.",

METHODS: Description of a new surgical procedure in one eye of one patient who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with ILM graft technique. Subsequent follow-up included optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity. RESULTS: After only 1 week, the OCT revealed the ILM graft plugging the retinal tear with complete resorption of subretinal fluid. The sealing effect of this graft persisted after 6 months. However, visual outcome was poor and corrected distance visual acuity was 20/200 as a result of the previous long-standing retinal detachment with loss of photoreceptors. CONCLUSION: We suggest that ILM graft could be performed as a first line treatment in the management of RRD secondary to ODC. This direct closure of the retinal tears, allows a quick and effective interruption of the communication between the subretinal space and the vitreous cavity. Detecting these retinal tears and applying this technique as soon as possible could achieve not only an earlier anatomical success but obtain good visual results in retinal tears with RRD secondary to ODC. Further studies will be necessary to provide more evidences.",

        "abstract": "The current study investigated the efficiency of poly ferric chloride (PFC) and poly titanium tetrachloride (PTC) in coagulation-flocculation process for treatment of paper and cardboard wastewater. The effect of pH (5-11), coagulant concentrations (100-1000 mg/L), mixing rate (10-60 rpm), mixing time (5-25 min), and settling time (5-30 min) were examined. The results showed that the removal efficiency for turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by PFC and PTC coagulants increased with pH rising up to 9 for the former and 7 for the latter coagulant. Furthermore, the removal efficiency for the afore-mentioned parameters increased along with a 30 rpm increase in the mixing rate, while the mixing time reached 20 min. It was also found that the best removal efficiencies for turbidity, TSS, and COD by PFC under optimal conditions (pH 9, coagulant dose 800 mg/L, and settling time of 25 min) were 97.11%, 99.1%, and 84.91%, respectively. In addition, the removal efficiencies for PTC (optimal conditions of pH 7, coagulant dose 600 mg/L, and settling time of 15 min) were found to be 98.29%, 99.29%, and 86.42%, respectively. Water recovery and the produced sludge volume by PFC were 80% and 200 cm(3), respectively, in the settling time of 25 min and for PTC were 81.5% and 185 cm(3), respectively, in the settling time of 15 min. Costs of the coagulation-flocculation process for treatment 1 m(3) of paper and cardboard wastewater using PTC and PFC were 0.42 $ and 0.32 $, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that compared to PFC, PTC with higher settling rate has a greater efficiency for treatment of paper and cardboard wastewater.",

        "abstract": "Current designs of powered prosthetic limbs are limited by the nearly exclusive use of DC motor technology. Soft actuators promise new design freedom to create prosthetic limbs which more closely mimic intact neuromuscular systems and improve the capabilities of prosthetic users. This work evaluates the performance of a hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) soft actuator for use in a prosthetic hand. We compare a linearly-contracting HASEL actuator, termed a Peano-HASEL, to an existing actuator (DC motor) when driving a prosthetic finger like those utilized in multi-functional prosthetic hands. A kinematic model of the prosthetic finger is developed and validated, and is used to customize a prosthetic finger that is tuned to complement the force-strain characteristics of the Peano-HASEL actuators. An analytical model is used to inform the design of an improved Peano-HASEL actuator with the goal of increasing the fingertip pinch force of the prosthetic finger. When compared to a weight-matched DC motor actuator, the Peano-HASEL and custom finger is 10.6 times faster, has 11.1 times higher bandwidth, and consumes 8.7 times less electrical energy to grasp. It reaches 91% of the maximum range of motion of the original finger. However, the DC motor actuator produces 10 times the fingertip force at a relevant grip position. In this body of work, we present ways to further increase the force output of the Peano-HASEL driven prosthetic finger system, and discuss the significance of the unique properties of Peano-HASELs when applied to the field of upper-limb prosthetic design. This approach toward clinically-relevant actuator performance paired with a substantially different form-factor compared to DC motors presents new opportunities to advance the field of prosthetic limb design.",

Patients referred to the NIH for new, recurrent, and/or metastatic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma were confirmed for EPAS1 gain-of-function mutation; imaging was evaluated for vascular malformations. We evaluated the Epas1A529V transgenic syndrome mouse model, corresponding to the mutation initially detected in the patients (EPAS1A530V), for vascular malformations via intravital 2-photon microscopy of meningeal vessels, terminal vascular perfusion with Microfil silicate polymer and subsequent intact ex vivo 14T MRI and micro-CT, and histologic sectioning and staining of the brain and identified pathologies. Further, we evaluated retinas from corresponding developmental time points (P7, P14, and P21) and the adult dura via immunofluorescent labeling of vessels and confocal imaging. We identified a spectrum of vascular malformations in all 9 syndromic patients and in all our tested mutant mice. Patient vessels had higher variant allele frequency than adjacent normal tissue. Veins of the murine retina and intracranial dura failed to regress normally at the expected developmental time points. These findings add vascular malformation as a new clinical feature of EPAS1 gain-of-function syndrome.",

The effective thickness of the space charge layer was calculated to be  approximately 60 nm at a bias potential of 1 V.

BACKGROUND: Glass elevator is defined as the rapid promotion of men to upper positions in certain professions in which women comprise the majority, such as nursing. METHODS: Data were collected from 134 nurse managers. Participants selected one of four resumes belonging to four virtual candidates for an open management position. They, then completed the Perception of Gender Scale. RESULTS: Nurse managers mostly selected men among the four candidates submitted to them for promotion to upper positions. None of the nurse managers' characteristics caused a statistically significant difference regarding the gender of the candidate they selected. No statistically significant difference was found between the perception of gender scores of those who selected female or male candidates. CONCLUSIONS: Men are two times more likely to be selected than women when selecting candidates for promotion with the same qualifications. This was not caused by the decision-makers' or nurse managers' personal and professional characteristics nor their perceptions on gender. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The psychological mechanisms that operate the 'glass elevator' in favour of men should be analysed in greater depth.",

This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in-depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid-19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid-19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21-27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady-state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2-mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark-blood T2-weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22-62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid-19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1-2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.

        "abstract": "Temporal theta slow-wave activity (TTA-SW) in premature infants is a specific neurobiomarker of the early neurodevelopment of perisylvian networks observed as early as 24 weeks of gestational age (wGA). It is present at the turning point between non-sensory driven spontaneous networks and cortical network functioning. Despite its clinical importance, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this spontaneous nested activity and its functional role have not yet been determined. The coupling between neural oscillations at different timescales is a key feature of ongoing neural activity, the characteristics of which are determined by the network structure and dynamics. The underlying mechanisms of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) are associated with several putative functions in adults. In order to show that this generic mechanism is already in place early in the course of development, we analyzed electroencephalography recordings from sleeping preterm newborns (24-27 wGA). Employing cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling analyses, we found that TTAs were orchestrated by the SWs defined by a precise temporal relationship. Notably, TTAs were synchronized to the SW trough, and were suppressed during the SW peak. Spontaneous endogenous TTA-SWs constitute one of the very early signatures of the developing temporal neural networks with key functions, such as language and communication. The presence of a fine-tuned relationship between the slow activity and the TTA in premature neonates emphasizes the complexity and relative maturity of the intimate mechanisms that shape the CFC, the disruption of which can have severe neurodevelopmental consequences.",

This work provided two AMP immobilized cellulose microspheres (MCC@AMP and MCC-g-AMP) as adsorbents for Cs removal by radiation grafting technique. MCC-g-AMP was prepared by radiation graft polymerization of GMA on microcrystalline cellulose microspheres (MCC) followed by reaction with AMP suspension, and MCC@AMP was synthesized by radiation hybrid grafting of AMP and GMA onto MCC through one step. The different structures and morphologies of two adsorbents were characterized by FTIR and SEM. The adsorption properties of two adsorbents against Cs were investigated and compared in batch and column experiments under different conditions. Both adsorbents were better obeyed pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model. MCC-g-AMP presented faster adsorption kinetic and more stable structure, whereas MCC@AMP presented more facile synthesis and higher adsorption capacity. MCC@AMP was pH independent in the range of pH 1-12 but MCC-g-AMP was sensitive to pH for Cs removal. The saturated column adsorption capacities of MCC@AMP and MCC-g-AMP were 5.4 g-Cs/L-ad and 0.75 g-Cs/L-ad in column adsorption experiments at SV 10 h(-1). Both adsorbents exhibited very high radiation stability and can maintain an adsorption capacity of >85% even after 1000 kGy gamma-irradiation. On the basis, two AMP-loaded adsorbents possessed promising application in removal of Cs from actual contaminated groundwater. These findings provided two efficient adsorbents for treatment of Cs in radioactive waste disposal.",

        "abstract": "The conserved three-dimensional structure of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has been varyingly observed in prokaryotes to humans that actively participate in the phosphorylation process of tyrosine residues in the protein, which results in the alteration of protein's function. Mutation and transcriptional or post-translational modifications lead to a deregulation of kinases, which ultimately fallout into the development of pathological conditions like cancer. The human genome encodes two kinds of tyrosine kinases: non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Among these kinases, VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling cascade is an important target to develop novel small-molecule inhibitors for the therapy of abnormal angiogenesis incorporated with cancer. Due to advances in the knowledge of the catalytic domain and 'DFG-motif' region, selective 'DFG-in' (type I) and 'DFG-out' (type II) VEGFR-2/KDR inhibitors were successfully developed, and some are in different phases of a clinical trial. 'DFG-out' (inactive) confirmation has significant advantages over 'DFG-in' (active) confirmation concerning the affinity of the ATP at the catalytic domain. Further, in the catalytic domain, between front and back cleft, smaller gatekeeper residue (Val916) present; therefore, selectivity against VEGFR-2 could be precisely achieved. In this review, small molecule type II/'DFG-out' inhibitors, their conformation, interaction at receptor binding pocket, and structural requirements to inhibit VEGFR-2 at the molecular level are discussed.HighlightsVEGFR-2 is a type of membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that regulates the process of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.Small molecule first-generation type I, 'DFG-in' and second-generation type II, 'DFG-out' VEGFR-2 inhibitors exhibit clinical benefits in the treatment of aberrant angiogenesis associated with cancer.Molecular docking of FDA approved and novel type II inhibitors were performed using X-ray crystal structures of VEGFR-2; binding site analysis was carried out.Structural requirements for the inhibition of VEGFR-2 were identified.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related syndrome characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after gestational 20 weeks. Oxidative stress, resulting from the imbalance between the production of oxidants and antioxidants in placentas, is recognized as a key pathology of PE. To date, the molecules that regulate antioxidants production remain unclear. CD151, a member of tetraspanins, is an important regulator of many physiological functions. However, the function of CD151 in oxidative stress and its association with pregnancy-related complications are currently unknown. In the present study, we have demonstrated that CD151 was a key regulator of antioxidants in placentas. Compared with the placentas of the controls, the placentas of PE patients exhibited decreased CD151 expression accompanying with decreased antioxidant gene expression (HO-1, NQO-1, GCLC and SOD-1). In vitro, overexpression of CD151 in trophoblast cells could enhance HO-1, NQO-1, GCLC and SOD-1 expression but downregulation of CD151 decreased those antioxidant genes expression, which indicates CD151 is the upstream of antioxidants. Importantly, the phenotype of PE (hypertension and proteinuria) was mimicked in the downregulating CD151 induced mouse model. Moreover, the beneficial effect of CD151 in trophoblast cells was hindered when ERK and Nrf2 signaling were blocked. Overall, our results revealed CD151 might be a new target for PE treatment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the following in patients who have undergone magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) and meet the proposed diagnostic criteria for gadolinium deposition disease (GDD): (1) the effectiveness of chelation therapy (CT) with intravenous Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in removing retained gadolinium (Gd) and factors affecting the amount removed; (2) the frequency of CT-induced Flare, that is, GDD diagnostic symptom worsening, and factors affecting Flare intensity; (3) whether, as reported in a separate cohort, GDD patients' serum cytokine levels differ significantly from those in healthy normal controls and change significantly in response to CT; and (4) whether urine Gd, Flare reaction, and serum cytokine findings in GDD patients are mimicked in non-ill patients described as having gadolinium storage condition (GSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one GDD subjects and 3 GSC subjects underwent CT. Patients provided pre-CT and post-CT 24-hour urine samples for Gd content determination along with pre-CT and 24-hour post-CT serum samples for cytokine analysis. Patients rated potential Flare 24 hours after CT. Pre-CT and post-CT 24-hour urine Gd analyses and Luminex serum cytokine assays were performed blind to patients' GDD and GSC status and all other data except age and sex. Serum cytokine levels in a healthy normal control group of age- and sex-matched subjects drawn from Stanford influenza vaccination studies were measured once, contemporaneously with those of GDD and GSC patients, using the same Luminex assay. RESULTS: Urine Gd amounts increased post-CT by 4 times or more after 87% of the 30 CT sessions. The most important factors appeared to be the time since the last GBCA dose and the cumulative dose received. Urine Gd amounts for GDD and GSC patients fell in the same ranges. All GDD patients, and no GSC patient, reported a Flare 24 hours post-CT. Linear regression found that Flare intensity was significantly predicted by a model including pre- and post-CT Gd amounts and the number of GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Post-CT, multiple cytokines showed strong positive relationships with GDD patients' Flare intensity in multivariable models. The pre-CT serum levels of 12 cytokines were significantly different in GDD patients compared with healthy flu vaccine controls. The small number of GSC patients precluded analogous statistical testing. Post-CT, GDD patients' serum levels of 20 cytokines were significantly decreased, and 2 cytokines significantly increased. These cytokines did not exhibit the same change pattern in the 3 GSC patients. The small number of GSC patients precluded statistical comparisons of GSC to GDD patients' results. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, 24-hour urine Gd content increased markedly and similarly in GDD and GSC patients after Ca-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid CT. Post-CT Flare reaction developed only in GDD patients. The current study is the second finding significantly different serum cytokine levels in GDD patients compared with healthy normal controls. These differences and the difference between GDD and GSC patients' Flare and cytokine responses to CT suggest some inflammatory, immunologic, or other physiological differences in patients with GDD. Further research into the treatment and physiological underpinnings of GDD is warranted.",

        "abstract": "General control non-repressible 5 (GCN5)-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) catalyse the acetylation of a diverse range of substrates, thereby orchestrating a variety of biological processes within prokaryotes and eukaryotes. GNAT enzymes can catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to substrates such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, amino acids, polyamines, peptides, vitamins, catecholamines, and large macromolecules including proteins. Although GNATs generally exhibit low to moderate sequence identity, they share a conserved catalytic fold and conserved structural motifs. In this current study we characterize the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure of a GNAT enzyme bound with acetyl-CoA from Elizabethkingia anophelis, an important multi-drug resistant bacterium. The tertiary structure is comprised of six alpha-helices and nine beta-strands, and is similar with other GNATs. We identify a new and uncharacterized GNAT dimer interface, which is conserved in at least two other unpublished GNAT structures. This suggests that GNAT enzymes can form at least five different types of dimers, in addition to a range of other oligomers including trimer, tetramer, hexamer, and dodecamer assemblies. The high-resolution structure presented in this study is suitable for future in-silico docking and structure-activity relationship studies.",

Problems of data collection and processing, poor information use, lack of identifying information required at specific levels, and inadequacy of resources are hindering the implementation of the program. OBJECTIVE: To assess the implementation status of Health Management Information System (HMIS) in hospitals of South West Shoa Zone, Oromia, Central Ethiopia. METHODS: The assessment was conducted in South West Shoa Zone hospitals using a cross-sectional study design. Using three dimensions, namely, availability of resources, compliance to guideline, and utilization of information were studied. All hospitals in the zone were included and 210 health workers were included in the study. Quantitative data were entered into Epi-data and analyzed using SPSS.v.23. Descriptive summery was done using the proportion and frequencies and qualitative results were analyzed thematically. The study was conducted from February 20, 2020, to March 20, 2020. RESULTS: All hospitals have at least one computer specifically assigned for HMIS, while none of the hospitals have an allocated budget for HMIS. Regarding service training, 82% of the respondents had received HMIS training. The overall Implementation status of HMIS was 58%, which showed as a judgment parameter of \"poor\" implementation. Particularly, availability (58%) and compliance (55%) dimensions are categorized as \"poor\" implementation, whereas the information utilization dimension is categorized as a judgment parameter of \"fair\" implementation. CONCLUSION: The overall implementation status of HMIS in the study area was poorly implemented according to the preset criteria with stakeholders. Therefore, allocation of budget specifically for HMIS, strengthening capacity building activities such as training and supportive supervision with written feedbacks are recommended for effective implementation of the Health Management Information System.",

The wave bioheat transfer equation in the tissue layer together with energy transport equation for blood flow layer has been used in the cylindrical polar coordinates. The analytical expression for blood velocity in the presence of magnetic field has been used from Gold's solution. The computational work has been performed by employing the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. A comparison has been made to validate our numerical results with the previous solution by setting some parameters. The temperature profiles have been plotted at different locations of the axial tissue length for various values of the Hartmann number, Prandtl number, Womersley number and Reynolds number. It is observed that the application of magnetic field increases heat transfer rate within tumor tissues which in turn attribute to an enhancement of temperature about 316 K or above for hyperthermic treatment in cancer therapy.",

Characteristics of cases and vectors, especially Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii, raise the hypothesis of a zoonosis with simians as reservoirs. The present review aims to report on investigations of the disease over a 23-year period. Two main sources have provided epidemiological data: the behavior of Anopheles vectors and the genetic and immunological aspects of Plasmodium spp. obtained from humans, Alouatta simians, and Anopheles spp. mosquitoes. Anopheles (K.) cruzii is the most captured species in the forest canopy and is the recognized vector. The similarity between P. vivax and Plasmodium simium and that between Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium brasilianum shared between simian and human hosts and the involvement of the same vector in the transmission to both hosts suggest interspecies transfer of the parasites. Finally, recent evidence points to the presence of Plasmodium falciparum in a silent cycle, detected only by molecular methods in asymptomatic individuals and An. (K.) cruzii. In the context of malaria elimination, it is paramount to assemble data about transmission in such non-endemic low-incidence areas.",

The meta-analysis identified 405 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), of which 40% were classified into various transporter classes, including accessory factors and primary active transporters as the major transport classes. A network analysis of the DETs revealed that adaptation to salinity is a highly regulated mechanism in which different functional modules play essential roles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a transcriptome meta-analysis of gills from crab RNA-Seq datasets under salinity. Additionally, this study is also the first to focus on the differential expression of diverse transporters and channels (transportome) in CMC. Our meta-analysis opens new avenues for a better understanding of the osmoregulation mechanism and the selection of potential transporters associated with salinity change.",

        "abstract": "Background: Studies with extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, isolated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) indicate benefits for the treatment of musculoskeletal pathologies as osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP). However, little is known about intercellular effects of EVs derived from pathologically altered cells that might influence the outcome by counteracting effects from \"healthy\" MSC derived EVs. We hypothesize, that EVs isolated from osteoblasts of patients with hip OA (coxarthrosis/CA), osteoporosis (OP), or a combination of both (CA/OP) might negatively affect metabolism and osteogenic differentiation of bone-marrow derived (B)MSCs. Methods: Osteoblasts, isolated from bone explants of CA, OP, and CA/OP patients, were compared regarding growth, viability, and osteogenic differentiation capacity. Structural features of bone explants were analyzed via muCT. EVs were isolated from supernatant of naive BMSCs and CA, OP, and CA/OP osteoblasts (osteogenic culture for 35 days). BMSC cultures were stimulated with EVs and subsequently, cell metabolism, osteogenic marker gene expression, and osteogenic differentiation were analyzed. Results: Trabecular bone structure was different between the three groups with lowest number and highest separation in the CA/OP group. Viability and Alizarin red staining increased over culture time in CA/OP osteoblasts whereas growth of osteoblasts was comparable. Alizarin red staining was by trend higher in CA compared to OP osteoblasts after 35 days and ALP activity was higher after 28 and 35 days. Stimulation of BMSC cultures with CA, OP, and CA/OP EVs did not affect proliferation but increased caspase 3/7-activity compared to unstimulated BMSCs. BMSC viability was reduced after stimulation with CA and CA/OP EVs compared to unstimulated BMSCs or stimulation with OP EVs. ALP gene expression and activity were reduced in BMSCs after stimulation with CA, OP, and CA/OP EVs. Stimulation of BMSCs with CA EVs reduced Alizarin Red staining by trend. Conclusion: Stimulation of BMSCs with EVs isolated from CA, OP, and CA/OP osteoblasts had mostly catabolic effects on cell metabolism and osteogenic differentiation irrespective of donor pathology and reflect the impact of tissue microenvironment on cell metabolism. These catabolic effects are important for understanding differences in effects of EVs on target tissues/cells when harnessing them as therapeutic drugs.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyse the effects of transglutaminase on the physicochemical, technological, rheological, and microstructural indicators of minced meat with the addition of plant raw materials. The formulations of minced meat from beef trimming, hemp protein, and flax flour were optimized in terms of biological value and optimal content of essential amino acids. The addition of plant components in amounts greater than 18% caused an increase in the content of protein, fat, and ash in the minced samples. The rheological properties of minced meat samples without enzyme treatment changed depending on the proportion of plant raw materials. When the content of the flax flour was increased, the minimum ultimate shear stress and viscosity were observed, while the maximum values for these indicators were achieved in samples containing about 15% hemp protein, as well as in samples without plant additives. When adding transglutaminase to the formulation, increases in the ultimate shear stress and viscosity were proven for all combined minced samples. The combined minces, containing flax flour, had a more plastic structure and the lowest modulus of elasticity, while minces including 14% hemp protein or more than 87% meat components were identical to the control samples in terms of deformation and elasticity. In enzyme-treated minces, the plasticity of the samples reduced while density and elasticity increased. Transglutaminase treatment contributed to the formation of optimal technological properties of combined minces. Microstructural analysis showed the intermolecular bonds between protein particles in combined minced samples with the addition of enzymes. The research results have demonstrated the effectiveness of using transglutaminase in the composition of combined minced meat for the formation of a homogeneous and dense system with the necessary technological and rheological properties.",

Although the prognosis of endometrial cancer is better than that of other gynecological cancers, the prognosis of advanced endometrial cancer is still poor and thus new therapeutic modalities, such as immune therapies, are urgently required. For the further development of new modalities, exploration of new biomarkers is important. The present study investigated the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) integrity as a ratio of the necrotic tumor cell-derived long cfDNA fragments to the total dead cell-derived short cfDNA fragments from genomic Alu elements in patients with advanced endometrial cancer during peptide vaccination treatment. The results demonstrated that: i) The plasma cfDNA integrity was decreased during the first cycle of vaccination in patients with endometrial cancer treated with the personalized peptide vaccination, and ii) the post-vaccination cfDNA integrity levels were correlated with good prognosis. Some of these findings have been confirmed in other cancers, and thus cfDNA integrity might be an important marker for future cancer vaccine therapies in general, and might also be applicable for other immune therapies.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers enable exquisite spatiotemporal control of gene expression in metazoans. Enrichment of monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is a major chromatin signature of transcriptional enhancers. Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (KDM1A, also known as LSD1), an H3K4me2/me1 demethylase, inactivates stem-cell enhancers during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, its role in undifferentiated mESCs remains obscure. Here, we show that KDM1A actively maintains the optimal enhancer status in both undifferentiated and lineage-committed cells. KDM1A occupies a majority of enhancers in undifferentiated mESCs. KDM1A levels at enhancers exhibit clear positive correlations with its substrate H3K4me2, H3K27ac, and transcription at enhancers. In Kdm1a-deficient mESCs, a large fraction of these enhancers gains additional H3K4 methylation, which is accompanied by increases in H3K27 acetylation and increased expression of both enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and target genes. In postmitotic neurons, loss of KDM1A leads to premature activation of neuronal activity-dependent enhancers and genes. Taken together, these results suggest that KDM1A is a versatile regulator of enhancers and acts as a rheostat to maintain optimal enhancer activity by counterbalancing H3K4 methylation at enhancers.",

No more than 50 cases have been published to date, including all histologic variants, and only three cases of bladder squamous cell carcinoma have been described. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a clinical case of a 31-year-old woman with bladder squamous cell carcinoma in the second trimester of pregnancy. After a C-section at 30 weeks, we performed radical cystectomy with extended bilateral lymphadenectomy, hysterectomy and right oophorectomy. The Studer neobladder technique was performed for urinary tract reconstruction. Definitive pathology showed invasive bladder squamous cell carcinoma, Grade 2, with microscopic infiltration of the perivesical fat, negative margins, and 3/28 lymph nodes with carcinoma (pT3aN2M0). The patient underwent 18 months of surveillance after radical cystectomy, without recurrence by PET-CT. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder cancer in pregnant women is extremely rare but must be considered in those with recurrent gross hematuria and/or recurrent urinary tract infection. To our knowledge, this case involves the longest recurrence-free survival of a pregnant woman with squamous cell bladder cancer published thus far.",

        "abstract": "The influenza virus causes severe respiratory illnesses and deaths worldwide every year. It spreads quickly in an overcrowded area like the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. Vaccination is the primary strategy for protection against influenza. Due to the occurrence of antigenic shift and drift of the influenza virus, a mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains of influenza may occur. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of mismatch between vaccine strains and circulating strains during Hajj, which brings together individuals from all over the globe. To this end, we develop deterministic mathematical models of influenza with different populations and strains from the northern and southern hemispheres. Our results show that the existence and duration of an influenza outbreak during Hajj depend on vaccine efficacy. In this concern, we discuss four scenarios: vaccine strains for both groups match/mismatch circulating strains, and vaccine strains match their target strains and mismatch the other strains. Further, there is a scenario where a novel pandemic strain arises. Our results show that as long as the influenza vaccines match their target strains, there will be no outbreak of strain H1N1 and only a small outbreak of strain H3N2. Mismatching for non-target strains causes about 10,000 new H3N2 cases, and mismatching for both strains causes about 2,000 more new H1N1 cases and 6,000 additional H3N2 cases during Hajj. Complete mismatch in a pandemic scenario may infect over 342,000 additional pilgrims (13.75%) and cause more cases in their home countries.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying NB pathogenesis are not fully known. Increasing evidence shows that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is important in multiple ways in NB progression. LncRNA could act as competitive endogenous RNA, serve as a scaffold for proteins, or participate in histone modification, thus affecting proliferation, migration, invasion, and differentiation of NB. Numerous lncRNAs polymorphisms are significantly associated with NB susceptibility. Differently expressed lncRNAs can be used to construct risk scores to evaluate patient outcomes. In conclusion, these lncRNAs have the potential to be diagnostic markers as well as promising therapeutic targets in the future.",

        "abstract": "In the physical description of photonic lattices, leaky-mode resonance and bound states in the continuum are central concepts. Understanding of their existence conditions and dependence on lattice parameters is of fundamental interest. Primary leaky-wave effects are associated with the second stop band at the photonic lattice Gamma point. The pertinent band gap is defined by the frequency difference between the leaky-mode band edge and the bound-state edge. This paper address the polarization properties of the band gaps resident in laterally periodic one-dimensional photonic lattices. We show that the band gaps pertinent to TM and TE leaky modes exhibit significantly differentiated evolution as the lattice parameters vary. This is because the TM band gap is governed by a surface effect due to the discontinuity of the dielectric constant at the interfaces of the photonic lattice as well as by a Bragg effect due to the periodic in-plane dielectric constant modulation. We find that when the lattice is thin (thick), the surface (Bragg) effect dominates the Bragg (surface) effect in the formation of the TM band. This leads to complex TM band dynamics with multiple band closures possible under parametric variation. In complete contrast, the TE band gap is governed only by the Bragg effect thus exhibiting simpler band dynamics. This research elucidates the important effect of polarization on resonant leaky-mode band dynamics whose explanation has heretofore not been available.",

Here, we analyse systematically the literature describing p63 and p73 protein-protein interactions to reveal distinct functions underlying the aforementioned distribution. We have found that p73 and p63 cooperate in the genome stability surveillance in proliferating cells; p73 specific interactors contribute to the transcriptional repression, anaphase promoting complex and spindle assembly checkpoint, whereas p63 specific interactors play roles in the regulation of mRNA processing and splicing in both proliferating and differentiated cells.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (MCAC) is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis when it presents metastases at diagnosis. Due to its very low incidence, there are no clear recommendations for the treatment of advanced disease. Olaparib (an oral PARP inhibitor) has been approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma harbouring germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Herein, we report the first case of a germline BRCA1 mutated unresectable MCAC which was effectively treated with olaparib. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old woman, without personal or family history of cancer, was diagnosed with ovarian and peritoneal metastases of MCAC. She underwent 12 cycles of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) obtaining a partial response and allowing radical surgery. One year later, local recurrence was documented, and other 12 cycles of GEMOX were administered obtaining a complete response. Seven years later, another local recurrence, not amenable to surgical resection, was diagnosed. She started FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil), obtaining a partial response after 8 cycles. Given the excellent response to platinum-based chemotherapy, BRCA testing was performed, and a BRCA1 germline mutation was detected. She was switched to maintenance olaparib due to chemotherapy-related toxicities and achieved an almost complete metabolic response, with a reduction in the diameter of the lesion, after three months of therapy. CONCLUSION: The current case suggests the beneficial effect of olaparib in BRCA mutated MCAC. However, further studies are required.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that cypermethrin (CYP), a broad spectrum pesticide has a teratogenic effect on rat offspring born to an exposed dam with no information on its effect on the development of the brain. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to study the postnatal development medulla oblongata of rat offspring exposed to CYP during the perinatal period and the possible neuroprotective role of melatonin. The offspring of treated female rats were organized into control, melatonin (1 mg/kg/day orally); CYP (12 mg/kg/day orally); and CYP/melatonin groups. The mothers received treatments from day 6 of gestation until day 21 after birth. At Postnatal days 7 and 21, the animals were sacrificed and their medulla oblongata was removed and subjected to histological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic studies. CYP induced neuronal degeneration by chromatolysis and pyknosis. Nuclear changes, cytoplasmic vacuolation, damage mitochondria, and breakdown of RER were also detected. Reduction of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), myelin basic protein (MBP), and oligodendrocyte transcription factor expressions and increment of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in the medulla oblongata of the developing rats were observed. On the other hand, melatonin led to an obvious improvement of the injured medulla oblongata tissues and ameliorating the damaging effects of CYP. In conclusion, melatonin has protected rats against CYP-induced histopathological and immunohistochemical changes. This may be due to the protection of MAP-2, conservation of MBP, an increment of oligodendrocytes, and alleviation of astrogliosis.",

Thus, directed drug development, toward personalised cancer treatment, is widely recognised as a necessary strategy in drug discovery research. However, broad generalisations on the modes of action of bioinorganic compounds are not conducive to tailored drug design, hence, fundamental mechanistic research is essential in realising personalised healthcare. In this work, anticancer properties of bis (1,10-phenanthroline) silver (I) acetate monohydrate (Ag-Phen), toward A549 lung cancer cells are presented. Biological assays were carried out to evaluate the effect of Ag-Phen on cell viability, reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial membrane potentials. In tandem with the biological assays, electrochemistry was employed to determine the real-time concentrations of intact Ag-Phen and dissociated Ag(+) in the extracellular medium using platinum microelectrodes, as a function of cellular exposure time. Observations from the assays conducted include, Ag-Phen induced cytotoxicity (IC(50) 4.5 muM at 72 h) and 2-fold ROS generation, and a 50% decrease in mitochondrial membrane potentials with respect to equivalent concentrations of Ag(+) and 1,10-phenanthroline. Bio-speciation studies, conducted electrochemically at platinum microelectrodes, revealed almost 50% of the Ag-Phen had dissociated after 2 h. Significant reductions in concentrations of dissociated Ag(+) (from 67.7 muM to 6.7 muM), and the Ag-Phen complex (from 50.2 muM to 11.7 muM) between 4 and 24 h from the extracellular medium, indicate cellular uptake of both. This novel method facilitates the real-time identification and quantification of electroactive species, both the intact Ag-Phen and Ag(+), in the presence of A549 cells.",

        "abstract": "VAMP7 is involved in autophagy and in exocytosis-mediated neurite growth, two yet unconnected cellular pathways. Here, we find that nutrient restriction and activation of autophagy stimulate axonal growth, while autophagy inhibition leads to loss of neuronal polarity. VAMP7 knockout (KO) neuronal cells show impaired neurite growth, whereas this process is increased in autophagy-null ATG5 KO cells. We find that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy-related LC3-interacting-region-containing proteins Atlastin 3 and Reticulon 3 (RTN3) are more abundant in autophagy-related protein ATG5 KO and less abundant in VAMP7 KO secretomes. Treatment of neuronal cells with ATG5 or VAMP7 KO conditioned medium does not recapitulate the effect of these KOs on neurite growth. A nanobody directed against VAMP7 inhibits axonal overgrowth induced by nutrient restriction. Furthermore, expression of the inhibitory Longin domain of VAMP7 impairs the subcellular localization of RTN3 in neurons. We propose that VAMP7-dependent secretion of RTN3 regulates neurite growth."

        "abstract": "The emergence and development of car-sharing has not only satisfied people's diverse travel needs, but also brought new solutions for improving urban traffic conditions and achieving low-carbon and green sustainable development. In recent years, car-sharing has had competition with other ways of getting around, as the acceptance of car-sharing has grown, notably taxis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore car-sharing travel costs advantages from the perspective of consumers and discover the competitive and complementary spaces between car-sharing and other modes. Therefore, taking Beijing as an example, this paper uses GPS trajectory data based on car-sharing orders to design a travel cost framework of car-sharing and taxis. We calculate and compare the travel cost difference between these two modes under different travel characteristics. The results indicate that car-sharing is a more economical way for consumers to travel for short or medium lengths of time, while people are more inclined to take taxis for distances of long duration. Compared with on workdays, at the weekend, the cost advantage of car-sharing is greater for long-distance trips. Moreover, the cost advantage of car-sharing increases gradually with the increase in travel distance. In addition, the travel costs of car-sharing and taxis are also affected by peak and off-peak traffic periods. Compared with off-peak periods, it is more cost-effective for travelers to take taxis during peak traffic periods for various travel distances. From the perspective of the travel cost, it is of great theoretical significance to discuss the substitution (market competition) and complementary relationship (market cooperation) between car-sharing and taxis in a detailed and systematic way. It provides methods and ideas for the comparative cost calculation of car-sharing and other travel modes. This paper also provides enlightenment and guidance for the development of car-sharing. Enterprises should implement differentiated pricing, designing different charging methods for different traffic periods, travel miles, and rental times, and set up additional stations in the surrounding areas of the city. Relevant government departments should also strictly manage the market access of car-sharing, and add or open car-sharing parking lots in centralized areas and for specific periods.",

Phylogenetic results of four nuclear loci including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and partial sequences of the actin, beta-tubulin, and translation elongation factor 1-alpha genes confirmed the isolates as Pleurostoma richardsiae. Pathogenicity trials conducted in the field involving 2- to 3-year-old branches of three widely planted oil olive cultivars (Arbequina, Arbosana, and Koroneiki) satisfied Koch's postulates and confirmed the pathogenic nature of this species to cause the decline of olive trees in California. All three cultivars were equally susceptible to Pl. richardsiae, indicating no detectable resistance to the pathogen. Additional isolations from symptomatic hosts including almond, peach, pistachio, and plum, also confirmed this species, suggesting that Pl. richardsiae is widespread in agricultural systems and should be considered an emerging pathogen of fruit and nut crops in California.",

METHODS: We analyzed multi-shell diffusion tensor images from 103 healthy young and older adults using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to examine relationships between white matter microstructure and RA rhythm stability. RA measures were computed using both cosinor and non-parametric methods derived from 7 days of actigraphy data. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were examined in this analysis. Because prior studies have suggested that the corpus callosum (CC) is sensitive to sleep physiology and RA rhythms, we also conducted a focused region of interest analysis on the CC. RESULTS: Greater rest-activity rhythm stability was associated with greater FA across both young and older adults, primarily in the CC and anterior corona radiata. This effect was not moderated by age group. While RA measures were associated with sleep metrics, RA rhythm measures uniquely accounted for the variance in white matter integrity. CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens existing evidence for a relationship between brain white matter structure and RA rhythm stability in the absence of health risk factors. While there are differences in RA stability between age groups, the relationship with brain white matter was present across both young and older adults. RA rhythms may be a useful biomarker of brain health across both periods of adult development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Essential tremor involves the cerebellum, yet quantitative analysis of dentate nucleus neurons has not been conducted. OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively compare neuronal density or neuronal number in the dentate nucleus of essential tremor versus age-matched controls. METHODS: Using a 7-mum thick Luxol fast blue hematoxylin and eosin-stained paraffin section, dentate nucleus neuronal density (neurons/mm(2) ) was determined in 25 essential tremor cases and 25 controls. We also applied a stereological approach in a subset of four essential tremor cases and four controls to estimate total dentate nucleus neuronal number. RESULTS: Dentate nucleus neuronal density did not differ between essential tremor cases and controls (P = 0.44). Total dentate nucleus neuronal number correlated with neuronal density (P = 0.007) and did not differ between essential tremor cases and controls (P = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal loss, observed in the Purkinje cell population in essential tremor, did not seem to similarly involve the dentate nucleus in essential tremor.

        "abstract": "With  approximately 36,000 described species, Agaricomycetes are among the most successful groups of Fungi. Agaricomycetes display great diversity in fruiting body forms and nutritional modes. Most have pileate-stipitate fruiting bodies (with a cap and stalk), but the group also contains crust-like resupinate fungi, polypores, coral fungi, and gasteroid forms (e.g., puffballs and stinkhorns). Some Agaricomycetes enter into ectomycorrhizal symbioses with plants, while others are decayers (saprotrophs) or pathogens. We constructed a megaphylogeny of 8,400 species and used it to test the following five hypotheses regarding the evolution of morphological and ecological traits in Agaricomycetes and their impact on diversification: 1) resupinate forms are plesiomorphic, 2) pileate-stipitate forms promote diversification, 3) the evolution of gasteroid forms is irreversible, 4) the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis promotes diversification, and 5) the evolution of ECM symbiosis is irreversible. The ancestor of Agaricomycetes was a saprotroph with a resupinate fruiting body. There have been 462 transitions in the examined morphologies, including 123 origins of gasteroid forms. Reversals of gasteroid forms are highly unlikely but cannot be rejected. Pileate-stipitate forms are correlated with elevated diversification rates, suggesting that this morphological trait is a key to the success of Agaricomycetes. ECM symbioses have evolved 36 times in Agaricomycetes, with several transformations to parasitism. Across the entire 8,400-species phylogeny, diversification rates of ectomycorrhizal lineages are no greater than those of saprotrophic lineages. However, some ECM lineages have elevated diversification rates compared to their non-ECM sister clades, suggesting that the evolution of symbioses may act as a key innovation at local phylogenetic scales.",

Our aim in this study is to show the utility of parameters such as neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), thrombocyte/lymphocyte ratio (TLR), and mean thrombocyte volume (MTV) as auxiliary laboratory methods in CL patients. About 107 patients who were admitted to our dermatological and venereal diseases outpatient clinic between January 2018 and January 2019 and were diagnosed with CL by microscopic examination and 74 healthy individuals were included in the study. There were no significant differences between the patient and control group in terms of neutrophil counts, leukocyte counts, platelet counts, and NLR values (P values: .271, .053, .263, and .459, respectively). When the TLR and MTV values of patients with CL and those of the healthy controls were compared, it was found that TLR and MTV values were statistically higher in patients with CL (P values of .010 and .044, respectively). Based on these data, NLR was not considered to be a suitable parameter for demonstrating inflammation in CL patients, but TLR and MTV were held to be an appropriate parameter for demonstrating inflammation in CL patients. In addition, we think that the increase in MTV and TLR, can be used as an auxiliary laboratory test in the diagnosis of CL disease.",

        "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, multifactorial and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, which can develop in a subset of individuals as a result of the exposure to severe stress or trauma. Such traumatic experiences have a major impact on molecular, biochemical and cellular systems, causing psychological and somatic alterations that affect the whole organism. Although the etiology of PTSD is still unclear, it seems to involve complex interaction between various biological genetic and environmental factors. Metabolomics, as one of the rapidly developing \"omics\" techniques, might be a useful tool for determining altered metabolic pathways and stress-related metabolites as new potential biomarkers of PTSD. The aim of our study was to identify metabolites whose altered levels allow us to differentiate between patients with PTSD and healthy control individuals. The study included two cohorts. The first, exploratory, group included 50 Croatian veterans with PTSD and 50 healthy control subjects, whereas a validation group consisted of 52 veterans with PTSD and 52 control subjects. The metabolomic analysis of plasma samples was conducted using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as well as gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The LC-MS analysis determined significantly different levels of two glycerophospholipids, PE(18:1/0:0) and PC(18:1/0:0), between control subjects and PTSD patients in both cohorts. The altered metabolites might play a role in multiple cellular processes, including inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, membrane breakdown, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, which could be associated with PTSD pathogenesis.",

Based on online survey data of 1,029 HIV care providers in Guangxi, China, we assessed their perspectives on the challenges for HIV service delivery and perceived impacts of such challenges on patient care during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to test the association between specific challenges and patient care outcomes controlling for socio-demographics of HIV care providers. The prominent impacts of COVID-19 on patient care outcomes included \"not being able to make follow-up visits on time\", \"not being able to get ARV refills timely\", and \"compromised ART adherence\". Patient care outcome was significantly associated with \"not being able to go to work due to quarantine and traffic restriction\", \"no overall arrangement\", \"no guideline for HIV service\", \"conflicts between HIV care and response to COVID-19\", and \"clinics were overwhelmed by COVID-19 care\". In response to dual epidemics of COVID-19 and HIV, policy makers may consider the potential impact of large-scale preventive strategies (e.g., lockdowns) on HIV care, assist healthcare providers to navigate shifting tasks and resetting priorities effectively, and develop clear guidelines and clinic-level arrangements to best serve both COVID-19 and HIV patients.",

        "abstract": "The interruption of vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease was certified in Chile in 1999. Our goal was to determine the effects of the interruption of vector transmission on the age and spatial distributions of the risk of Chagas disease. We analyzed cases of Chagas disease by age and sex between 1989 and 2017, from notified disease reports of the Ministry of Health. Bayesian risk maps were constructed using the Besag-York-Mollie model. The reported cases of Chagas disease had a mean age of 45.9 +/- 17.6 years. Small changes in the age distribution were found among different periods (chi(2)(15) = 602.4, p < 0.001). These were explained mainly by numbers lower than those expected in age groups 0-39 years in the 2011-2017 period. Part of the observed reduction in the proportion of individuals in the lower strata could be explained by the aging of the Chilean population. An increase of reported cases was detected after the interruption of vector-borne transmission (F(1,327) = 4.24, p < 0.04), with regional differences (F(14,1308) = 4.35, p < 0.001). The regions of the north-central area that have the highest burden of Chagas tended to decrease the relative risk, while the regions of the south tended to increase and small risk areas appear in zones where there are no insect vectors. There is still no clear evidence of a reduction in the reported cases in Chile. This could be explained mainly by an improvement in the detection of cases, but it cannot be ruled out that vector transmission still exists. The changes in distribution suggest potential impact from human internal migration and blood transfusion. This study provides strong evidence supporting the idea that entomological surveillance and long-term follow-up of Chagas disease need to be maintained after certification of interruption in endemic countries.",

CTS-g-PAMD was copolymerized with AM, DMC and chitosan (CTS) under UV-H(2)O(2) initiation. In addition, the effects of single factor experiments on the molecular weight (MW) CTS grafting efficiency (GE) of CTS-g-PAMD were determined and the optimal copolymerization conditions were achieved. The GE of CTS-g-PAMD reached 91.1% and the MW was 4.82 x 10(6) Da. As revealed from the characterized results of Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), (1)H/ NMR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the successful synthesis of CTS-g-PAMD was confirmed, which is considered to be conducive to explaining sludge dewatering performance. Under the optimal conditions (pH = 7.0, flocculant dosage = 35 mg/L), the best flocculating performance (FCMC: 73.7%; SRF: 4.7 x 10(12) m.kg(-1), turbidity: 9.4 NTU) and large and dense sludge flocs (floc size d(50) = 379.142 microm, floc fractal dimension D(f) = 1.58) were formed. The DMC and CTS chain segments exhibiting cationic properties significantly improved the positive charge density and enhanced the electrical patching effect of CTS-g-PAMD. The long molecular chain of CTS-g-PAMD exhibited superior extensibility, which enhanced bridging effect on adsorption. Moreover, the sludge floc after undergoing CTS-g-PAMD conditioning exhibited robust shear resistance and regeneration ability. After the sludge floc was crushed and broken, a large and dense sludge floc was formed, helping significantly reduce the sludge specific resistance (SRF), turbidity and cake moisture content (FCMC) and enhance the sludge dewatering effect. The novel CTS-g-PAMD flocculant shows promising practical applications and high market value.",

ORIF was performed in four of the cases and percutaneous screw fixation was performed in eight of the cases. The average follow-up period was 13 months. Complications such as wound infection, nerve injury, screw loosening, malunion or nonunion of fracture were absent. For clinical assessment, considerable mprovements were observed for the AOFAS and VAS scores at 4 and 12 months postoperatively for both techniques. There was no significant difference for AOFAS scores and VAS scores between the two techniques (p > 0.05). Both techniques showed good functional outcome and were performed for posterior talar process fracture following the fracture displacement guidelines. Percutaneous screw fixation treatment with computer-assisted three-dimensional evaluation shortened the operation time and reduced incidences of surgical complications.",

        "abstract": "Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is a popular vegetable that is grown in both tropical and subtropical regions all year long. The crop is cultivated on small family farms and is a good source of income for resource-limited farmers in Pakistan. In early May 2019, leaf spots on eggplant (cv. Bemisaal) were observed in an experimental field (31 degrees 26'14.0\"N 73 degrees 04'23.4\"E) at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Early symptoms were small, circular, brown, necrotic spots uniformly distributed on leaves. The spots gradually enlarged and coalesced into large, nearly circular or irregularly shaped spots that could be up to 3 cm in length. The center of the spots was light tan, surrounded by a dark brown ring, a chlorotic halo, and tended to split in the later developmental stages. Disease incidence was approximately 35% in the infected field. The causal agent of this disease was isolated consistently by plating surface sterilized (1% NaOCl) sections of symptomatic leaf tissue onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). After 6 days incubation at 25 degrees C with a 12-h photoperiod, fungal colonies had round margins and the cottony mycelia were dark olivaceous with a mean diameter of 7.5 cm. For conidial production, the fungus was grown on potato carrot agar (PCA) and V8 agar media under a 16-h/8-h light/ dark photoperiod at 25 degrees C. Conidiophores were septate, light to olive golden brown with a conidial scar, from which conidia were produced. Conidia were borne singly or in short chains and were obpyriform to obclavate, measured 29 +/- 4.8 x 13.25 +/- 2.78 mum (n=30) with zero to three longitudinal and two to six transversal septa. The morphological characters matched those of Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keisel (Simmons et al. 2007). DNA was extracted using the DNAzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific MA, USA). For molecular identification, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region between ITS1 and ITS2, actin gene (beta-Actin), translation elongation factor (TEF-1alpha) gene, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene of two representative isolates (JLUAF1 and JLUAF2) were amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), beta-Actin 512 F/783 R, EF1-728F/-986R (Carbone et al. 1999), and gpd1/gpd2 (Berbee et al. 1999), respectively. The sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MT228734.1 and MT228735.1 for ITS; MT260151.1 and MT260152.1 for beta-Actin, MT260163.1 and MT260164.1, for TEF-1a, and MT260157.1 and MT260158.1 for GAPDH). BLASTn analysis of these sequences showed 100% identity with the sequences of A. alternata for ITS rDNA, beta-Actin, TEF-1alpha, and GAPDH, respectively. Based on the morphological characters and DNA sequences, the leaf spot isolates of eggplant were identified as A. alternata. To confirm the pathogenicity on eggplant, six-week old healthy potted eggplants of cv. Bemisaal were sprayed at the true leaf stage with conidial suspensions of A. alternata (106 conidia/ml; obtained from 1-week-old cultures) amended with 0.1% (vol/vol) of Tween 20 until runoff (1.5 to 2 ml per plant) using an atomizer in the greenhouse. Three plants were inoculated with each of the two isolates (JLUAF1 and JLUAF2), whereas three control plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water amended with 0.1% Tween 20. The plants were incubated at 25 +/- 2 degrees C in a greenhouse, and the experiment was conducted twice. After 10 days of inoculation, each isolate induced leaf spots which were similar to typical spots observed in the field, whereas the control plants remained symptomless. The fungus was re-isolated from symptomatic tissues. Re-isolated fungal cultures were morphologically and molecularly identical to A. alternata, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. Previously, A. alternata has been reported to cause leaf spots on eggplant in India (Raina et al. 2018). To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf spot on eggplant in Pakistan. The disease could represent a threat for eggplant crops due to its increasing cultivation. It is important to develop disease management strategies for Alternaria alternata causing leaf spot of Eggplant in Pakistan.",

        "abstract": "During the previous influenza seasons, between 2010 and 2016, the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) provided variable efficacy against influenza in the U.S., causing the recommendation against the use of the LAIV. In striking contrast, pre-clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated superior efficacy of LAIV against mismatched influenza viruses, compared to inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). This disparity in reported vaccine efficacies between pre-clinical and clinical studies may in part be explained by limitations of the animal models of influenza. In particular, the absence of pre-existing immunity in animal models has recently emerged as a potential explanation for the discrepancies between preclinical findings and human studies. This commentary focuses on the potential impact of pre-existing immunity on LAIV induced immunogenicity with an emphasis on cross-protective immunity.",

Even after treatment completion, these challenges may cause continued disablement and diminished quality of life (QoL). Resilience may serve to minimize the disabling impact of HNCa and, in turn, maximize QoL. The purpose of this study was to formally assess resilience in HNCa survivors and explore its relationship with QoL. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Forty HNCa survivors completed three validated, self-report questionnaires pertaining to the collection of resilience and QoL data. Descriptive and correlational analyses were performed. RESULTS: Resilience was identified in HNCa survivors and a positive correlation was found between resilience and QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that resilience may buffer the influence of HNCa on QoL. Thus, screening for reduced levels of resilience may proactively facilitate identification of those who are most vulnerable to the psychosocial impact of HNCa. Interventions that foster resilience may ameliorate the challenges of HNCa and maximize QoL.",

In the midst of this unprecedented crisis, video conferencing platforms (e.g., Zoom, WebEx, MS Teams) and learning management systems (LMSs), like Moodle, Blackboard and Google Classroom, are being adopted and heavily used as online learning environments (OLEs). However, as such media solely provide the platform for e-interaction, effective methods that can be used to predict the learner's behavior in the OLEs, which should be available as supportive tools to educators and metacognitive triggers to learners. Here we show, for the first time, that Deep Learning techniques can be used to handle LMS users' interaction data and form a novel predictive model, namely DeepLMS, that can forecast the quality of interaction (QoI) with LMS. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, DeepLMS results in average testing Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [Formula: see text], and average correlation coefficient between ground truth and predicted QoI values [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text], when tested on QoI data from one database pre- and two ones during-Covid-19 pandemic. DeepLMS personalized QoI forecasting scaffolds user's online learning engagement and provides educators with an evaluation path, additionally to the content-related assessment, enriching the overall view on the learners' motivation and participation in the learning process.",

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using survey data. PARTICIPANTS: Women diagnosed with BC at ages 21-79 years, between 2012-2014, recruited from the New Jersey State Cancer Registry. METHODS: HRQoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) instrument. Descriptive statistics compared Hispanics and NHWs, and multivariate regression analyses identified predictors of HRQoL. RESULTS: HRQoL was significantly higher scores among NHW (85.7 +/- 18.5) than Hispanics (79.4 +/- 20.1) (p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, comorbidities (beta: -13.3, 95%CI: -20.6, -5.92), late-stage diagnosis (beta: -5.67, 95%CI: -10.7, -0.62), lower income (beta: -13.9, 95%CI: -19.8, -7.97) and younger age at diagnosis were associated with lower HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Socio-demographic and clinic characteristics were significant predictors of HRQoL among diverse BC survivors.

        "abstract": "In the golden age of pharmaceutical nanocarriers, we are witnessing a maturation stage of the original concepts and ideas. There is no doubt that nanoformulations are extremely valuable tools for drug delivery applications; the current challenge is how to optimize them to ensure that they are safe, effective and scalable, so that they can be manufactured at an industrial level and advance to clinical use. In this context, lipid nanoparticles have gained ground, since they are generally regarded as non-toxic, biocompatible and easy-to-produce formulations. Pharmaceutical applications of lipid nanocarriers are a burgeoning field for the transport and delivery of a diversity of therapeutic agents, from biotechnological products to small drug molecules. This review starts with a brief overview of the characteristics of solid lipid nanoparticles and discusses the relevancy of performing systematic preformulation studies. The main applications, as well as the advantages that this type of nanovehicles offers in certain therapeutic scenarios are discussed. Next, pharmacokinetic aspects are described, such as routes of administration, absorption after oral administration, distribution in the organism (including brain penetration) and elimination processes. Safety and toxicity issues are also addressed. Our work presents an original point of view, addressing the biopharmaceutical aspects of these nanovehicles by means of descriptive statistics of the state-of-the-art of solid lipid nanoparticles research. All the presented results, trends, graphs and discussions are based in a systematic (and reproducible) bibliographic search that considered only original papers in the subject, covering a 7 years range (2013-today), a period that accounts for more than 60% of the total number of publications in the topic in the main bibliographic databases and search engines. Focus was placed on the therapeutic fields of application, absorption and distribution processes and current efforts for the translation into the clinical practice of lipid-based nanoparticles. For this, the currently active clinical trials on lipid nanoparticles were reviewed, with a brief discussion on what achievements or milestones are still to be reached, as a way of understanding the reasons for the scarce number of solid lipid nanoparticles undergoing clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Background: Few studies have reported the transmission characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in low-density populations. This study has therefore analyzed the epidemiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Northwestern China, an area with low population density. Methods: From January 21 to March 11, 2020, data from patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in areas of Northwestern China with lower population densities were retrospectively analyzed. Certain variables were categorized as numbers and percentages, with the ratio between resident patients (no history of going out during the epidemic) and imported patients representing the contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19. Hospitalization time was also calculated. Results: A total of 617 COVID-19 patients were reported in Northwestern China, and the morbidity and mortality rates of 0.000005 and 0.011, respectively. Further analysis showed that the morbidity was inversely proportional to population density and distance from Wuhan City. This study enrolled 473 confirmed cases; among these patients, there were 248 residents and 225 imported cases with a ratio of 1:1. The youngest and oldest patients were 1 and 94 years of age, respectively, with a median age of 42 years. Fifteen (3.2%) patients were children or infants. Two patients were pregnant, and one patient gave birth to a healthy baby with negative results during her disease course. About 17.3% of patients (82 cases) were healthy carriers without any symptoms during their disease course. One male patient (0.2%) had recurrence of a positive test result 4 days after discharge. The median hospitalization time was 16.0 days, ranging from 2.0 to 43.0 days. Further analysis showed that age (P = 0.03) and severity status (P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with hospitalization time. Conclusions: The morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 patients in the regions with a low population density were lower than those of the national average in China. All populations were susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Asymptomatic patients with positive results should be taken seriously, and the hospitalization time of patients is associated with their age and severity status.",

This study aims to use the whole brain structural connectome (SC) to gain insights into the underlying disconnectivity which may be implicated in the clinical features of PSP-RS. METHODS: Sixteen patients of PSP-RS and 12 healthy controls were recruited. Disease severity was quantified using PSP rating scale (PSPRS), and mini-mental scale was applied to evaluate cognition. Thirty-two direction diffusion MRIs were acquired and used to compute the structural connectome of the whole brain using deterministic fiber tracking. Group analyses were performed at the edge-wise, nodal, and global levels. Age and gender were used as nuisance covariates for all the subsequent analyses, and FDR correction was applied. RESULTS: Network-based statistics revealed a 34-edge network with significantly abnormal edge-wise connectivity in the patient group. Of these, 25 edges were cortical connections, of which 68% were frontal connections. Abnormal deep gray matter connections were predominantly comprised of connections between structures of the basal ganglia. The characteristic path length of the SC was lower in PSP-RS, and nodal analysis revealed abnormal degree, strength, local efficiency, betweenness centrality, and participation coefficient in several nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Significant alterations in the structural connectivity of the whole brain connectome were observed in PSP-RS. The higher degree of abnormality observed in nodes belonging to the frontal lobe and basal ganglia substantiates the predominant frontal dysfunction and parkinsonism observed in PSP-RS. The findings of this study support the concept that PSP-RS may be a network-based disorder.",

The purpose of this case report is to bring attention to skin manifestations in the early stage of COVID-19 in order to support frontline physicians in their crucial activity of case identification. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is an Italian 32-year-old female nurse who had several close contacts with multiple patients with COVID-19 as part of her professional workload. On March 13, 2020, the patient developed an itchy, erythematous papular rash (sparing only her face, scalp, and abdomen), which lasted for 10 days. The rash was accompanied by a feeling of general fatigue that gradually worsened over the following days and has continued for 5 months (until the end of July 2020). During the first week of remote assessment carried out by her general practitioner, the patient gradually developed a dry cough, intermittent fever, and diarrhoea and then had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Her skin manifestations disappeared completely 48 days after the onset of the disease, followed by the disappearance of the dry cough. CONCLUSIONS: In light of recent studies, this case report suggests that skin manifestations, when taken into account with other situational factors (such as profession and patient history) should be taken into proper consideration by frontline physicians as possibly being caused by SARS-CoV-2. Early identification of COVID-19 is a key part of the strategy of case detection and case isolation. To enhance this activity, further research is needed to establish frequency, symptoms, signs, and pathogenesis of skin manifestations in patients with COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a distressing symptom that older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) seek to minimize through management. Research consistently points out the disparities that older African Americans face when managing chronic pain conditions, but a major gap in the literature is how pain care policy at the federal, state, and local level protects or exposes older African Americans to disadvantaged care. AIMS: The purpose of this original research is to examine policy issues and care enhancement opportunities that emerge from the narratives and personal stories of older African Americans living with chronic OA pain. DESIGN: A secondary qualitative data analysis. METHODS: African Americans (>/=50 years) with OA pain living in Louisiana were interviewed to gather global perspectives and specific information about how they manage OA pain. Narrative analytic techniques were applied to 18 individual, semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Three policy-related pain management issues and implications surfaced from the older African Americans' rich narratives: (1) \"Access to and navigation of the healthcare system,\" (2) \"Affordability of natural supplements, medications, and treatments,\" and (3) \"Expansion of pain palliative care and community programs.\" CONCLUSIONS: African American older adults face numerous challenges in managing pain well. Navigating the healthcare system is an abiding issue, and perceived injustice in care was a common thread throughout the narratives. On the positive side, older African Americans also proposed practice- and policy-related solutions to counter the pain treatment challenges. Nurses are natural advocates for patients, and should work to change healthcare policies that unfairly marginalize ethnic/racial older adults' long-term ability to manage chronic pain.",

Serum samples were collected from a total of 445 age-matched males; 126 with prostate cancer, 108 with bladder cancer, 91 with different types of cancers, and 120 healthy controls, and then analyzed by ELISA for detection of anti-Trichomonas IgG and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The results revealed that only 8.3% of controls were seropositive for trichomoniasis, compared with 19% of prostate cancer patients (P = 0.015). There were positive associations between the levels of PSA and tumor stage with T. vaginalis IgG optical density scores among the seropositive cases (P < 0.001 and < 0.05, respectively). However, no significant correlations were detected between seropositivity of T. vaginalis and other prognostic factors or overall survival in those patients. In conclusion, chronic T. vaginalis infection may be associated with prostate cancer, but it does not seem that this STI aggravates the cancer status.",

This is a synthetic (i.e., not systematic) review. DATA SYNTHESIS: C. difficile infection is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. Antibiotics are the most significant C. difficile infection risk factor, and among antibiotics, cephalosporins, clindamycin, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and piperacillin-tazobactam confer the highest risk. Age, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and end-stage renal disease are risk factors for C. difficile infection development and mortality. C. difficile infection diagnosis is based on testing appropriately selected patients with diarrhea or on clinical suspicion for patients with ileus. Patients with fulminant disease (C. difficile infection with hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon) should be treated with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole, as well as rectal vancomycin in case of ileus. Patients who do not respond to initial therapy should be considered for fecal microbiota transplant or surgery. Proper infection prevention practices decrease C. difficile infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Strong clinical evidence supports limiting antibiotics when possible to decrease C. difficile infection risk. For patients with fulminant C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin reduces mortality, and adjunctive therapies (including IV metronidazole) and interventions (including fecal microbiota transplant) may benefit select patients. Several important questions remain regarding fulminant C. difficile infection management, including which patients benefit from fecal microbiota transplant or surgery.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medication non-adherence is a major public health problem among diabetes mellitus patients. However, there is a lack of data regarding its magnitude and the factors contributing to Ethiopia's non-adherence, especially in the Tigrai region. This study was conducted to assess the magnitude of non-adherence and its contributing factors among diabetes mellitus patients in the Eastern Zone of Tigrai, Northern Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Adigrat and Wukro General Hospitals using a pre-tested, self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire developed from the relevant literature and a checklist developed to review patient medical cards for the period of the 15th of March to the 15th of July, 2019. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20. Association between the dependent and the independent variable was performed using logistic regression and a p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: From a total of 321 study participants, 63.9% of the patients were non-adherent to their medications. Two-month dose issued on each visit (AOR = 2.865, 95% CI 1.380-5.949), dose issued for more than three months (AOR = 4.314, 95% CI 1.526-12.195), monthly income below 500 birr (AOR = 5.048, 95% CI 2.094-12.168), monthly income between 500 and 2000 birr (AOR = 2.593, 95% CI 1.032-6.517), distance greater than 24 kilometers from hospital to home (AOR = 10.091, 95% CI 3.509-29.020), more than four prescribed medications per visit (AOR=7.192, 95% CI= 2.171-23.824), never receiving counseling (AOR=22.334, 95% CI= 9.270-53.810), and diabetes-related admission (AOR=0.248, 95% CI= 0.078-0.789) were significantly associated with patients' non-adherence to diabetes mellitus medications. CONCLUSION: The level of diabetic medication adherence was suboptimal, and our study highlights that better monthly earning, nearby health-care accessibility, fewer prescribed medication, and getting appropriate counseling about diabetes mellitus were predictive of adherence to medications. Hence, an urgent intervention targeting the development of guidelines that involve these determinates should be employed to improve health care.",

        "abstract": "Rice production and sustainability are challenged by its most dreadful pest, the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal, BPH). Therefore, the studies on rice-BPH interactions and their underlying mechanisms are of high interest. The rice ontogenetic defense, such as the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has mostly been investigated against the pathogens, with only a few reports existing against the insect infestations. Thus, revealing the involvement of rice miRNAs in response to BPH infestations will be beneficial in understanding these complex interactions. In this study, the small RNA profiling of the IR56 rice in response to separate BPH infestations of varied virulence levels identified the BPH-responsive miRNAs and revealed the differential transcript abundance of several miRNAs during a compatible and incompatible rice-BPH interaction. The miRNA sequence analysis identified 218 known and 28 novel miRNAs distributed in 54 miRNA families. Additionally, 138 and 140 numbers of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified during the compatible and incompatible interaction, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed the target gene candidates of DE miRNAs (including osa-miR2871a-3p, osa-miR172a, osa-miR166a-5p, osa-miR2120, and osa-miR1859) that might be involved in the IR56 rice defense responses against BPH infestation. Conversely, osa-miR530-5p, osa-miR812s, osa-miR2118g, osa-miR156l-5p, osa-miR435 and two of the novel miRNAs, including novel_16 and novel_52 might negatively modulate the IR56 rice defense. The expressional validation of the selected miRNAs and their targets further supported the IR56 rice defense regulatory network. Based on our results, we have proposed a conceptual model depicting the miRNA defense regulatory network in the IR56 rice against BPH infestation. The findings from the study add further insights into the molecular mechanisms of rice-BPH interactions and will be helpful for the future researches.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is recognized as being a significant cause of gastrointestinal illness due to its wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. Infection with Cryptosporidium spp. is especially common in young domestic ruminants (calves, lambs and goat kids) and has been associated with economic losses worldwide. In contrast to cattle, to date, detailed studies on Cryptosporidium infections in sheep from Europe are still limited; thus, their importance as reservoirs of Cryptosporidium species with implications on animal and public health still needs to be clarified. This study evaluates the prevalence and zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium spp. in sheep farms in Italy. A total of 915 individual faecal samples divided into three different animal categories were collected from 61 sheep farms. Each sample was examined by microscopy of faecal smears stained by modified Ziehl-Neelsen and by biomolecular techniques. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 10.1% of the animals examined and in 34.4% of the farms. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was significantly higher (chi(2) = 51.854; P < 0.001) in diarrhoeic samples than in pasty or normal faeces. Genotype analyses showed the presence of two Cryptosporidium species: C. parvum and C. ubiquitum. Subtyping analysis of C. parvum isolates revealed the presence of subtypes IIa15G2R1 and IIdA20G1 and of subtype XIIa for C. ubiquitum. These findings have public health implications since both Cryptosporidium species identified are considered zoonotic, and C. parvum is the second-most common Cryptosporidium species infecting humans. Our data reveal that lambs, especially those excreting diarrhoeic faeces, may be important reservoirs of Cryptosporidium. We also highlight the need to establish adequate control and monitoring programmes for the control of this infection in sheep farms primarily through coprological monitoring.",

The performance of ZnO UV PDs can be improved in two orientations: by reduction of the dark current and by increasing the photocurrent. In the study, we used two processes to prepare ZnO UV PDs: photochemical vapor deposition to fabricate silicon dioxide as an insulator layer and a radio frequency sputter system to prepare the ZnO film as an active layer. The results show that the silicon dioxide layer can reduce the dark current. Moreover, a large photo-dark current ratio of the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structured PD is 200 times than the metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) structured PD. When the silicon dioxide thickness is 98 nm, we can significantly enhance the rejection ratio. The silicon dioxide layer can reduce the noise effect and enhance the device detectivity. These results indicate that the insertion of a silicon dioxide layer into ZnO PDs is potentially useful for practical applications.",

Here, utilizing 3D cancer spheroid models coupled with CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis mediated by NRF2 hyperactivation. NRF2 hyperactivation was necessary for proliferation and survival in lung tumor spheroids. Antioxidant treatment rescued survival but not proliferation, suggesting the presence of distinct mechanisms. CRISPR screens revealed that spheroids are differentially dependent on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for proliferation and the lipid peroxidase GPX4 for protection from ferroptosis of inner, matrix-deprived cells. Ferroptosis inhibitors blocked death from NRF2 downregulation, demonstrating a critical role of NRF2 in protecting matrix-deprived cells from ferroptosis. Interestingly, proteomics analyses show global enrichment of selenoproteins, including GPX4, by NRF2 downregulation, and targeting NRF2 and GPX4 killed spheroids overall. These results illustrate the value of spheroid culture in revealing environmental or spatial differential dependencies on NRF2 and reveal exploitable vulnerabilities of NRF2-hyperactivated tumors.",

We sought to examine clinical and demographic factors associated with meeting glycaemic targets in type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 4594 individuals with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome of the study was assessing factors associated with meeting HbA(1c) targets. Secondary endpoints included factors associated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) use and persistent C-peptide secretion. RESULTS: Socioeconomic deprivation was strongly associated with a lower likelihood of achieving an HbA(1c) <58 mmol/mol (7.5%) (20% in the most deprived quintile vs. 40% in the least deprived, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, absence of smoking history (OR 3.06, p < 0.001), flash monitoring (OR 1.49, p < 0.001), CSII (1.43, p = 0.022) and longer diabetes duration (OR 1.02 per year, p = 0.004) were independently associated with achieving HbA(1c) <58 mmol/mol (7.5%), whereas increasing age (OR 0.99 per year, p = 0.004) and C-peptide <50 pM (OR 0.58, p < 0.001) were associated with a lower likelihood of meeting this target. Low C-peptide (<50 pM) was less likely in men (OR 0.55, p < 0.001) and never smokers (0.44, p < 0.001) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of deprivation, non-smoking, higher C-peptide, technology use, lower BMI and male gender were all associated with a higher likelihood of meeting HbA(1c) targets. Access to proven diabetes treatments is lower in the most deprived individuals. Urgent efforts are required to provide treatments which are effective across the socioeconomic gradient.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A \"concerning post\" is a display of a user's emotional crisis on a social media platform. A better understanding of concerning posts is relevant to suicide prevention, but little is known about social media users' attitudes and responses to concerning posts. Military veterans in the United States are disproportionately affected by suicide, often use social media, and may have exposure to individuals with elevated suicide risk via concerning posts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was (1) to obtain insight into whether and how US military veterans respond to members of their social network on social media (ie, \"friends\") who are experiencing substantial emotional distress, and (2) to identify potential interventions that could assist in users' response to concerning posts. METHODS: We recruited veterans through Facebook and conducted semistructured interviews with 30 participants between June and December 2017. We used a summary template for rapid analysis of each interview, followed by double-coding using a codebook based on topic domains from the interview guide. Members of the research team met regularly to discuss emerging patterns in the data, generate themes, and select representative quotes for inclusion in the manuscript. RESULTS: Veterans were reluctant to disclose emotional and health issues on Facebook, but they were open to reaching out to others' concerning posts. There was a complex calculus underlying whether and how veterans responded to a concerning post, which involved considering (1) physical proximity to the person posting, (2) relationship closeness, (3) existing responses to the post, and (4) ability to maintain contact with the person. Veterans desired additional training, backed by community-based veteran organizations, in how to respond to concerning posts from peers. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to incorporate features that will help veterans effectively respond to concerning posts from peers into suicide prevention training and to expand access for veterans to such training.",

        "abstract": "Eosinophils are key regulators of adipose tissue homeostasis, thus characterization of adipose tissue-related molecular factors capable of regulating eosinophil activity is of great interest. Leptin is known to directly activate eosinophils in vitro, but leptin ability of inducing in vivo eosinophilic inflammatory response remains elusive. Here, we show that leptin elicits eosinophil influx as well as its activation, characterized by increased lipid body biogenesis and LTC(4) synthesis. Such leptin-triggered eosinophilic inflammatory response was shown to be dependent on activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, since it was (i) inhibited by rapamycin pre-treatment and (ii) reduced in PI3K-deficient mice. Local infiltration of activated eosinophils within leptin-driven inflammatory site was preceded by increased levels of classical mast cell-derived molecules, including TNFalpha, CCL5 (RANTES), and PGD(2). Thus, mice were pre-treated with a mast cell degranulating agent compound 48/80 which was capable to impair leptin-induced PGD(2) release, as well as eosinophil recruitment and activation. In agreement with an indirect mast cell-driven phenomenon, eosinophil accumulation induced by leptin was abolished in TNFR-1 deficient and also in HQL-79-pretreated mice, but not in mice pretreated with neutralizing antibodies against CCL5, indicating that both typical mast cell-driven signals TNFalpha and PGD(2), but not CCL5, contribute to leptin-induced eosinophil influx. Distinctly, leptin-induced eosinophil lipid body (lipid droplet) assembly and LTC(4) synthesis appears to depend on both PGD(2) and CCL5, since both HQL-79 and anti-CCL5 treatments were able to inhibit these eosinophil activation markers. Altogether, our data show that leptin triggers eosinophilic inflammation in vivo via an indirect mechanism dependent on activation of resident mast cell secretory activity and mediation by TNFalpha, CCL5, and specially PGD(2).",

Diabetic patients with hypothyroidism also are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Screening for thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients will allow early treatment of hypothyroidism. The aim of this study was to assess the level of thyroid dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to identify the association of thyroid dysfunction with diabetic complications. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted at departments of Medicine & Endocrinology in JIPMER, Pondicherry, between June 2016 and May 2019. 331 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending the out-patient department without any prior history of thyroid disease, chronic liver disease or acute illness were recruited for the study. All subjects were screened for diabetic complications (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy & cardiovascular disease). Thyroid function test was done in all subjects using chemiluminescent immunoassay method. RESULTS: Hypothyroidism was seen in 13.9%, while hyperthyroidism was observed in 3.6% of the study subjects. Thyroid dysfunction was more common among females than males. No correlation was seen between thyroid dysfunction and diabetic complications in the study subjects. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is 17.5% in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thyroid dysfunction did not have any correlation with diabetic complications.",

        "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) is highly expressed in pancreatic islets, and its activation increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreas. Therefore, GPR40 is considered as a target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with T2DM and GPR40 is also expressed by hepatocytes and macrophages, it is important to understand the role of GPR40 in NAFLD. However, the role of GPR40 in NAFLD in animal models has not been well defined. In this study, we fed wild-type or GPR40 knockout C57BL/6 mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 wk and then assessed the effect of GPR40 deficiency on HFD-induced NAFLD. Assays on metabolic parameters showed that an HFD increased body weight, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and GPR40 deficiency did not mitigate the HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities. In contrast, we found that GPR40 deficiency was associated with increased body weight, insulin, insulin resistance, cholesterol, and ALT in control mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD). Surprisingly, histology and Oil Red O staining showed that GPR40 deficiency in LFD-fed mice was associated with steatosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that GPR40 deficiency also increased F4/80, a macrophage biomarker, in LFD-fed mice. Furthermore, results showed that GPR40 deficiency led to a robust upregulation of hepatic fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 expression. Finally, our in vitro studies showed that GPR40 knockdown by siRNA or a GPR40 antagonist increased palmitic acid-induced FAT/CD36 mRNA in hepatocytes. Taken together, this study indicates that GPR40 plays an important role in homeostasis of hepatic metabolism and inflammation and inhibits nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by possible modulation of FAT/CD36 expression.",

This study aimed to assess the clinical hemostatic efficacy and safety of two EBRT hypofractionated schedules. METHODS: From February 2008 to October 2017, 31 patients were referred to our department for palliative hemostatic bladder irradiation. EBRT consisted of two schedules: \"continuous\" treatment (CRT) was delivered following consecutive 3-10 weekdays (3-6Gy/fraction (fr), to a total dose of 18-30Gy) (n=14); the \"discontinuous\" schedule (DRT) consisted of 23Gy in 4fr (6.5Gy/fr on days 1 and 3, followed by 5Gy/fr on days 15 and 17; n=12). The primary endpoint was the rate of hemostatic control (HC) at the end of the radiation course. Other endpoints included mid-term HC, toxicities and overall survival. Comparative analyses were performed by exact Fisher test with a cut-off of 0.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: The rate of HC at the end of EBRT was 92% (n=24) with no differences between CRT and DRT (100% vs 86%; p=0.48). The median follow-up was 6 months, HC was achieved in 15/26 (58%) patients at the last follow-up, without meaningful differences between CRT and DRT (50% vs 67%; p=0.45). Three and two patients developed acute grade </=2 diarrhea in CRT and DRT groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that both hypofractionated \"continuous\" and \"discontinuous\" EBRT are well tolerated and represent acceptable schedules for patients with limited life expectancy. DRT schedule could be preferred for departments' organization to increase the slots for the treatment of other referred patients for radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As short-term mortality declines for critically ill patients, a growing number of survivors face long-term physical, cognitive and/or mental health impairments. After hospital discharge, many critical illness survivors require an in-depth plan to address their healthcare needs. Early after hospital discharge, numerous survivors experience inadequate care or a mismatch between their healthcare needs and what is provided. Many patients are readmitted to the hospital, have substantial healthcare resource use and experience long-lasting morbidity. The objective of this study is to investigate the gap in healthcare needs occurring immediately after hospital discharge and its association with hospital readmissions or death for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this multicentre prospective cohort study, we will enrol 200 survivors of ARF in the intensive care unit (ICU) who are discharged directly home from their acute care hospital stay. Unmet healthcare needs, the primary exposure of interest, will be evaluated as soon as possible within 1 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge, via a standardised telephone assessment. The primary outcome, death or hospital readmission, will be measured at 3 months after discharge. Secondary outcomes (eg, quality of life, cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder) will be measured as part of 3-month and 6-month telephone-based follow-up assessments. Descriptive statistics will be reported for the exposure and outcome variables along with a propensity score analysis, using inverse probability weighting for the primary exposure, to evaluate the relationship between the primary exposure and outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethics approval from Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the University of Utah IRB (for the Veterans Affairs site). These results will inform both clinical practice and future interventional trials in the field. We plan to disseminate the results in peer-reviewed journals, and via national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03738774). Registered before enrollment of the first patient.",

The present article seeks to update what is evidence of genetic studies in the literature for these diseases, from polymorphism analyses, expression of candidate genes in tissues and broad genomic association studies (GWAS). However, it is necessary to point out that there is great difficulty in replicating and using the findings, mainly due to the lack of statistical power, the high rate of false-positive results and the large number of variables involved.",

Rats were randomly divided into three groups, including the normal control rat group, STZ-induced diabetic cataract rat group (DM group), and STZ-induced diabetic cataract rat group treated with 200 mug/mL recombinant rat beta-NGF (DM + NGF group). Cataract formation was evaluated by portable slit lamp biomicroscopy following pupil dilation at 8 weeks. The expression levels of NGF, aldose reductase (AR), and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the lens epithelial cells (LECs) of the three groups were measured in the presence or absence of topical NGF. TUNEL-positive LECs were quantified to determine if hyperglycemia caused LEC apoptosis. At 8 weeks, the mean cataract score in the control group was significantly lower than that in DM and DM + NGF groups, and the score in the DM + NGF group was significantly lower than that in the DM group. At the equatorial zone and anterior central zone of lens, NGF and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase expression levels were significantly decreased in the DM group; however, they were partially restored in the DM + NGF group. At the equatorial zone and anterior central zone of lens, AR expression and TUNEL-positive apoptotic LECs were significantly increased in the DM group compared with the control group, however, they were significantly decreased in the DM + NGF group. In conclusion, topical NGF could delay the progression of diabetic cataracts by attenuating polyol pathway activation and increasing Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein levels.",

Oxygen and sulphur moieties are regarded as dopant species in C(x)N(y)QDs and sourced from cheap solid precursors viz. cysteine and maleic acid. Morphological studies of C(x)N(y)QDs have done by SEM and TEM techniques, while structural analysis has carried out using FTIR, XPS, EDS and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The strong tendency of dispersivity of this QD in water has revealed by its zeta potential value of -32.4 mV. Optical properties of the as-prepared QDs have optimized at different excitation wavelengths. The photoluminescence stability of the dispersion is tested in various pH solutions and under continuous UV irradiation (365 nm). After that, sensing property is observed in quenching of photoluminescence feature of as-prepared QDs by direct addition of various concentrations of H(2)Q. We obtained lower detection limit (LOD) of 50 nM (S/N = 3) in linear range from 12 to 57.5 muM. The reduction in photoluminescence of QDs may be attributed to electron transfer from QDs to oxidized H(2)Q via -S(-) and -COO(-) groups present at its surface. Further, as-prepared QDs matrix exhibited high selectivity for hydroquinone over a range of potential interfering agents. Thus, the present work shows cost-effective facile synthesis of highly stable O- and S-doped carbon nitride (C(x)N(y)) quantum dots as promising photoluminescent sensor for pollutant hydroquinone without help of any enzyme or polymer assisted system.",

It is unclear, however, which NK cell populations are capable of mounting antigen-specific recall responses and how such functions are regulated at the molecular level. Here, we identify and characterize a discrete population of CD49a(+)CD16(-) NK cells in the human liver that displays increased epigenetic potential to elicit memory responses and has the functional properties to exert antigen-specific immunity in the skin as an effector site. Integrated chromatin-based epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling revealed unique characteristics of hepatic CD49a(+)CD16(-) NK cells when compared with conventional CD49a(-)CD16(+) NK cells, thereby defining active genomic regions and molecules underpinning distinct NK cell reactivity. In contrast to conventional NK cells, our results suggest that adaptive CD49a(+)CD16(-) NK cells are able to bypass the KIR receptor-ligand system upon antigen-specific stimulation. Furthermore, these cells were highly migratory toward chemokine gradients expressed in epicutaneous patch test lesions as an effector site of adaptive immune responses in the skin. These results define pathways operative in human antigen-specific adaptive NK cells and provide a roadmap for harnessing this NK cell subset for specific therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine strategies.",

The impact of losing a nucleobase on the conformation and dynamics of B-DNA is well characterized. Yet AP sites seem to present an entirely different chemistry in nucleosomal DNA, with lifetimes reduced up to 100-fold, and the much increased formation of covalent DNA-protein cross-links leading to strand breaks, refractory to repair. We report microsecond range, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that capture the conformational dynamics of AP sites and their tetrahydrofuran analogs at two symmetrical positions within a nucleosome core particle, starting from a recent crystal structure. Different behaviours between the deoxyribo-based and tetrahydrofuran-type abasic sites are evidenced. The two solvent-exposed lesion sites present contrasted extrahelicities, revealing the crucial role of the position of a defect around the histone core. Our all-atom simulations also identify and quantify the frequency of several spontaneous, non-covalent interactions between AP and positively-charged residues from the histones H2A and H2B tails that prefigure DNA-protein cross-links. Such an in silico mapping of DNA-protein cross-links gives important insights for further experimental studies involving mutagenesis and truncation of histone tails to unravel mechanisms of DPCs formation.",

Especially, in the area of neural disorders such as epilepsy and traumatic brain injury, cooling has promising prospects. It is well documented in animal models, that the application of focal brain cooling can effectively terminate epileptic discharges. There is, however, limited data regarding human clinical trials. In this review article, we will discuss the main aspects of therapeutic hypothermia focusing on its use in treating epilepsy. The various experimental approaches and device concepts for focal brain cooling are presented and their potential for controlling and suppressing seizure activity are compared.",

The current study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the most frequent cognitive side effects after ECT. We also discuss the most common cognitive tests in ECT follow-up. We searched studies published from 2000 to 2017 in English and French language in Pubmed, EBM Reviews, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Standardized cognitive tests were separated into 11 cognitive domains. Comparisons between cognitive measures included pre-ECT baseline with post-ECT measures at 3 times: PO1, immediately post-ECT (within 24 hours after last ECT); PO2, short term (1-28 days); and PO3, long term (more than 1 month). A total of 91 studies were included, with an aggregated sample of 3762 individuals. We found no significant changes in global cognition with Mini-Mental State Examination at PO1. Hedges g revealed small to medium effect sizes at PO2, with individuals presenting a decrease in autobiographical memory, verbal fluency, and verbal memory. Verbal fluency problems showed an inverse correlation with age, with younger adults showing greater deficits. At PO3, there is an improvement on almost all cognitive domains, including verbal fluency and verbal memory. There is a lack of standardization in the choice of cognitive tests and optimal cognitive timing. The Mini-Mental State Examination is the most common screening test used in ECT, but its clinical utility is extremely limited to track post-ECT cognitive changes. Cognitive assessment for ECT purposes should include autobiographical memory, verbal fluency, and verbal memory.",

In this study, focused ultrasound treatment in combination with microbubbles (FUS-MB) improved Abeta drainage in early dementia model mice, 5XFAD. FUS-MB enhanced solute Abeta clearance from brain, but not plaques, to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space and then deep cervical lymph node (dCLN). dCLN ligation exaggerated memory impairment and progress of plaque formation and also the beneficial effects of FUS-MB upon Abeta removal through CSF-lymphatic routes. In this ligation model, FUS-MB improved memory despite accumulation of Abeta in CSF. In conclusion, FUS-MB enhances glymphatic-lymphatic clearance of Abeta mainly by increasing brain-to-CSF Abeta drainage. We suggest that FUS-MB can delay dementia progress in early period and benefits of FUS-MB depend on the effect of Abeta disposal through CSF-lymphatics.",

However, reported risks of some comorbidities in those with psoriasis and PsA are somewhat different according to the research design. Moreover, pathomechanisms underlying comorbidities of those with psoriasis and PsA remain poorly elucidated. The purpose of this review is to provide the most updated comprehensive view of the risk of systemic comorbidities in those with psoriasis and PsA. Molecular mechanisms associated with the development of various comorbidities in those with psoriasis and PsA are also reviewed based on recent laboratory and clinical investigations.

This affected ongoing clinical research, particularly among those most vulnerable to the pandemic, like dementia patients. Fundacio ACE is a research center and memory clinic based in Barcelona, Spain, one of the hardest-hit countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the ad-hoc strategic plan developed to cope with this crisis and to share its outcomes. METHODS: We describe participants' clinical and demographic features. Additionally, we explain our strategic plan aimed at minimizing the impact on clinical trial research activities, which included SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG serological tests to all participants and personnel. The outcomes of the plan are described in terms of observed safety events and drop-outs during the study period. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were participating in 16 active clinical trials in Fundacio ACE when the lockdown was established. During the confinement, we performed 1018 calls to the participants, which led to identify adverse events in 26 and COVID-19 symptoms in 6. A total of 83 patients (64%) could restart on-site visits as early as May 11, 2020. All SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic tests performed before on-site visits were negative and only three IgG serological tests were positive. Throughout the study period, we only observed one drop-out, due to an adverse event unrelated to COVID-19.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Care for older adults with cancer became more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine healthcare providers' clinical barriers, patient questions, and overall experiences related to care delivery for these patients during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer and Aging Research Group along with the Association of Community Cancer Centers developed a 20-question survey for healthcare providers of older adults with cancer. Eligible participants were recruited by email sent through professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and social media. This manuscript reports the qualitative data from the survey's three open-ended questions. Free text, open-ended survey items were analyzed by two independent coders for identification of common themes using NVivo software. Theme agreement was reached through consensus and count comparisons of participant responses were made. RESULTS: Healthcare system organizational challenges and meeting basic needs and support were commonly reported themes among respondents (n = 274). Barriers to care delivery included organizational challenges, patients' access to resources and support, concerns for patients' mental and physical health, and telehealth challenges. Respondents reported older adults were asking about their health and cancer care as well as access to basic needs and supports. Providers described worrying about patients' mental health, fear of personal safety, frustration in multi-level institutions, as well as experiencing positive leadership and communication. CONCLUSION: Providers are faced with balancing their concerns for personal and patient safety. These findings demand resources and support allocation for older adults with cancer and healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium alloys have exhibited a rapid rate of corrosion and thus early implant failure, so this study was designed to investigate the longer-term effects and in particular on wound closure. The aim of the study is to evaluate Mg-Ca-Zn Alloys as promising biodegradable implants in the field of maxillofacial surgery, which have so far never been evaluated for the changing conditions from a saliva to a serum-like environment after wound closure. Magnesium-0.6/calcium-0.8 wt.% zinc alloys were either immersed for 10 days in artificial saliva or 10 days in Hank's salt solution as control groups. The test group was transferred from artificial saliva to Hank's salt solution after 5 days in order to simulate wound closure. Corrosion rates were determined by immersion testing. Additional electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed. Prior artificial saliva exposure led to significantly decreased (p = 0.0272) corrosion rates after transfer to Hank's solution in comparison to sole Hank's solution exposure (0.1703 vs. 0.6675 mg/(cm(2).day)) and sole artificial saliva exposure (0.3180 mg/(cm(2).day)), which both exhibit a strong increase after 5 days. The results were in accordance with the scanning electron microscopy and EDX pictures. Prior saliva exposure could protect from increasing corrosion rates after wound closure. Thus Mg-Ca-Zn Alloys are promising future implant alloys in oral surgery, whereas other surgical fields without saliva exposure have to deal with accelerated corrosion rates after 5 days.",

        "abstract": "The response of soft actuators made of stimuli-responsive materials can be phenomenologically described by a stimulus-deformation curve, depicting the controllability and sensitivity of the actuator system. Manipulating such stimulus-deformation curve allows fabricating soft microrobots with reconfigurable actuation behavior, which is not easily achievable using conventional materials. Here, we report a light-driven actuator based on a liquid crystal polymer network containing diarylethene (DAE) photoswitches as cross-links, in which the stimulus-deformation curve under visible-light illumination is tuned with UV light. The tuning is brought about by the reversible electrocyclization of the DAE units. Because of the excellent thermal stability of the visible-absorbing closed-form DAEs, the absorbance of the actuator can be optically fixed to a desired value, which in turn dictates the efficiency of photothermally induced deformation. We employ the controllability in devising a logical AND gate with macroscopic output, i.e., an actuator that bends negligibly under UV or visible light irradiation, but with profound shape change when addressed to both simultaneously. The results provide design tools for reconfigurable microrobotics and polymer-based logic gating.",

AIMS: Through use of the Dermatologic Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a modified hair growth questionnaire, we aimed to evaluate the effect of dexpanthenol (DXP) as a new option for FPHL. METHODS: Women who received 500 mg intramuscular DXP weekly for FPHL were included in this study. They were evaluated in terms of DLQI and laboratory characteristics, before and after DXP treatment, and were examined with a modified hair growth questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall satisfaction with the appearance of the hair was described by the patients as 57.1% \" I am satisfied,\" 28.6% \"I am very satisfied,\" and 14.3% \"I am neutral (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied).\" There was a statistical difference between the mean DLQI scores before and after DXP treatment (P < .001). No statistical difference was found in the laboratory characteristics of the patients before and after DXP treatment (P > 0.05). No side effect was reported during DXP treatment. CONCLUSION: Dexpanthenol is a safe and novel drug that may increase the quality of life in patients with FPHL.",

        "abstract": "Persistent neural activity in cortical, hippocampal, and motor networks has been described as mediating working memory for transiently encountered stimuli(1,2). Internal emotional states, such as fear, also persist following exposure to an inciting stimulus(3), but it is unclear whether slow neural dynamics are involved in this process. Neurons in the dorsomedial and central subdivisions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHdm/c) that express the nuclear receptor protein NR5A1 (also known as SF1) are necessary for defensive responses to predators in mice(4-7). Optogenetic activation of these neurons, referred to here as VMHdm(SF1) neurons, elicits defensive behaviours that outlast stimulation(5,8), which suggests the induction of a persistent internal state of fear or anxiety. Here we show that in response to naturalistic threatening stimuli, VMHdm(SF1) neurons in mice exhibit activity that lasts for many tens of seconds. This persistent activity was correlated with, and required for, persistent defensive behaviour in an open-field assay, and depended on neurotransmitter release from VMHdm(SF1) neurons. Stimulation and calcium imaging in acute slices showed that there is local excitatory connectivity between VMHdm(SF1) neurons. Microendoscopic calcium imaging of VMHdm(SF1) neurons revealed that persistent activity at the population level reflects heterogeneous dynamics among individual cells. Unexpectedly, distinct but overlapping VMHdm(SF1) subpopulations were persistently activated by different modalities of threatening stimulus. Computational modelling suggests that neither recurrent excitation nor slow-acting neuromodulators alone can account for persistent activity that maintains stimulus identity. Our results show that stimulus-specific slow neural dynamics in the hypothalamus, on a time scale orders of magnitude longer than that of working memory in the cortex(9,10), contribute to a persistent emotional state.",

METHODS: A total of 334 dental implants placed in 111 partially edentulous patients (34 males, 77 females) and restored with fixed prostheses were included in this study. The patients were recalled 12-146 months after completion of the prosthodontic treatment. Clinical parameters included modified plaque index (mPI), modified bleeding index (mBI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and radiographic bone loss (BL). The effects of the following potential explanatory variables on these parameters were analyzed: the presence of keratinized mucosa, age, sex, oral hygiene status, history of periodontitis, cigarette smoking, implant site, and time elapsed since prosthesis delivery. Statistical analysis included multivariate ordinal logistic regression and generalized estimating equations. Significance wa s established when two-sided p-values were less than 0.05. RESULTS: The mPI, mBI, and PPD in the presence or absence of keratinized mucosa did not show statistically significant differences. However, the presence of keratinized mucosa was significantly related to BL (odds ratio 4.33, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that the presence of keratinized mucosa is useful for reducing bone resorption and can help to maintain peri-implant tissue health.",

        "abstract": "The potential adverse environmental and health-related impacts of antibiotics are becoming more and more concerning. China is globally the largest antibiotic producer and consumer, possibly resulting in the ubiquity and high detection levels of antibiotics in environmental compartments. Clear status on the concentration levels and spatial distribution of antibiotic contamination in China's environment is necessary to gain insight into the establishment of legal and regulatory frameworks. This study collects information from over 170 papers reporting the occurrence and distribution of antibiotics in China's environment. A total of 110 antibiotics were detected, and 28 priority antibiotics were ubiquitous in China in almost all compartments of the environment, excluding the atmosphere. Seven dominant antibiotics in all environment compartments were identified by cluster analysis, including tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, ofloxacin, enrofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Meanwhile, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine, and sulfamethazine were also frequently found in aqueous phases. Among the main basins where antibiotics were detected, the Haihe River Basin had higher median antibiotic concentrations in surface water compared to other basins, while the Huaihe River Basin had higher median concentrations in sediment. The median values of antibiotic concentrations in the sources were as follows: animal manure, 39 mug/kg (microgram per kilogram); WWTP (wastewater treatment plant) sludge, 39 mug/kg; animal wastewater, 156 ng/L (nanogram per liter); WWTP effluent: 15 ng/L. These concentrations are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the receptors (soil, 2.1 mug/kg; sediment, 4.7 mug/kg; surface water, 8.1 ng/L; groundwater, 2.9 ng/L), whether in solid or aqueous phases. Based on the number of detected antibiotics in various environmental compartments, animal farms and WWTPs are the main sources of antibiotics, and surface water and sediment are the main receptors of antibiotics. Hierarchical clustering identified the two main pathways of antibiotic transfer in various environmental compartments, which are from animal wastewater/WWTP effluent to surface water/sediment and from animal manure/WWTP sludge to soil/groundwater.",

Cellular signal transmission requires the dynamic formation of spatiotemporal controlled molecular interactions. One of the most important signaling circuits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the one controlled by cAMP-Protein Kinase A (PKA). In budding yeast, extracellular glucose and a plethora of signals related with growth and stress conditions regulate the intracellular cAMP levels that modulate PKA activity which in turn regulates a broad range of cellular processes. The cAMP-PKA signaling output requires a controlled specificity of the PKA responses.

        "abstract": "The risk of personal data exposure through unauthorized access has never been as imminent as today. To counter this, biometric authentication has been proposed: the use of distinctive physiological and behavioral characteristics as a form of identification and access control. One of the recent developments is electroencephalography (EEG)-based authentication. It builds on the subject-specific nature of brain responses which are difficult to recreate artificially. We propose an authentication system based on EEG signals recorded in response to a simple motor paradigm. Authentication is achieved with a novel two-stage decoder. In the first stage, EEG signal features are extracted using an inception- and a VGG-like deep learning neural network (NN) both of which we compare with principal component analysis (PCA). In the second stage, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for binary classification to authenticate the subject based on the extracted features. All decoders are trained on EEG motor-movement data recorded from 105 subjects. We achieved with the VGG-like NN-SVM decoder a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 2.55% with an overall accuracy of 88.29%, a FAR of 3.33% with an accuracy of 87.47%, and a FAR of 2.89% with an accuracy of 90.68% for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively. With the Inception-like NN-SVM decoder we achieved a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 4.08% with an overall accuracy of 87.29%, a FAR of 3.53% with an accuracy of 85.31%, and a FAR of 1.27% with an accuracy of 93.40% for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively. The PCA-SVM decoder achieved accuracies of 92.09%, 92.36%, and 95.64% with FARs of 2.19%, 2.17%, and 1.26% for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively.",

All the designed compounds selectively inhibited the MAO-B isoenzyme, exhibiting many of them IC(50) values ranging from sub-micromolar to nanomolar grade and lacking neuronal toxicity. The 7-bromo-3-(6-bromopyridazin-3-yl)coumarin (18c), the most potent compound of these series (IC(50) = 60 nM), was subjected to further in vivo studies in a reserpine-induced mouse PD model.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess ellipsoid zone (EZ) alterations in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. METHODS: Prospective, observational case series. Forty-three patients (43 eyes) underwent complete ophthalmological examination at baseline and at 24 months: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), biomicroscopy, fundus photography, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were performed. Acquisition protocol included 19-line raster scan. Alterations in EZ were marked on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and the area was manually calculated on a near-infrared reflectance image. Three patterns were identified: A (decrease >0.25 mm2), B (+/-0.25 mm2), and C (increase >0.25 mm2). Primary outcome was to describe different patterns of EZ alteration. Secondary outcomes included their correlation with BCVA and the description of a central optically preserved islet. RESULTS: At baseline, altered EZ was identified in 40 eyes. Worse BCVA significantly correlated with larger EZ alterations but not with lesion extension on fundus photograph. Only \"pattern-C\" eyes unveiled BCVA worsening at follow-up. Optically preserved islet was detected in 16 eyes (37%), disclosing significantly better vision; its disappearance at follow-up (n = 7; 44% of 16 eyes) correlated with a decrease in BCVA. CONCLUSION: The assessment of EZ status might represent a valuable functional marker in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy because stable alterations and the maintenance of a central optically preserved islet are associated with better visual acuity.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for the clinical trial community, both in the rapid establishment of COVID-19 clinical trials and many existing non-COVID-19 studies either being temporarily paused (whether that is a complete pause or pause in some activities) and/or adapting their processes. Trial managers have played a key role in decision-making, undertaking risk assessments and adapting trial processes, working closely with other members of the research team. This article presents some of the ways in which trial management processes have been altered and the key role that trial managers have played. It has been born out of discussions between trial managers in the UK who are members of the UK Trial Managers' Network (UKTMN), a national network of trial management professionals managing non-commercial trials.In these unprecedented times, clinical trials have faced many uncertainties and broad-ranging challenges encompassing a range of activities including prioritising patient safety amidst the pandemic, consenting and recruiting new participants into trials, data collection and management and intervention delivery. In many cases, recruitment has been paused whilst mitigations have been put in place to continue data collection. Innovative solutions have been implemented to ensure we continue, where possible, to deliver high-quality clinical trials. Technology has provided many solutions to these challenges, and trial managers have adapted to new ways of working whilst continuing to deliver their clinical trials. Trial management groups are now faced with new uncertainties around re-starting clinical trials, and it is unclear currently how this will go, though working together with sponsors, funders and site teams is clearly a priority.Clinical trial teams have worked together to ensure their trials have adapted quickly whilst ensuring participant safety is given utmost importance. There are clear examples where the trial community have come together to share experiences and expertise, and this should continue in the future to ensure the innovative practices developed become embedded in the design and conduct of clinical trials in the future.",

        "abstract": "The strictly anaerobic serum bottles were applied to investigate methane oxidation coupled to chlorate (ClO(3)(-)) reduction (MO-CR) without exogenous oxygen. 0.35 mM ClO(3)(-) was consumed within 20 days at the reduction rate of 17.50 muM/d, over three times than that of ClO(4)(-). Chlorite (ClO(2)(-)) was not detected throughout the experiment and the mass recovery of Cl(-) was over 89%. Isotope tracing results showed most of (13)CH(4) was oxided to CO(2), and the electrons recovery reached to 77.6%. Small amounts of (13)CH(4) was consumed for DOC production probably through aerobic methane oxidation process, with oxygen generated from disproportionation reaction. In pMMO (key enzyme in aerobic oxidation of methane) inhibition tests, ClO(3)(-) reduction rate was slowed to 7. 0 mumol/d by 2 mM C(2)H(2), real-time quantitative PCR also showed the transcript abundance of pMMO and Cld were significantly dropped at the later period of experiment, indicating that the O(2) disproportionated from ClO(2)(-) was utilized to active CH(4). NC10 bacteria Candidatus Methylomirabilis, related closely to oxygenic denitrifiers M. oxyfera, was detected in the system, and got enriched along with chlorate reduction. Several pieces of evidence supported that NC10 bacteria promoted CH(4) oxidation coupled to ClO(3)(-) reduction, these oxygenic denitrifiers may perform ClO(2)(-) disproportionation to produce O(2), and then oxidized methane intracellularly.",

However, little evidence exists relating the inflammatory potential of diet and BC in Latin American countries and how this may relate to rurality.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII((R))) and BC considering urbanization contexts in Cordoba, Argentina.A frequency-matched case-control study (317 BC cases, 526 controls) was conducted from 2008 through 2016. DII scores were computed based on dietary intake assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Multi-level logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the association between DII and BC, following adjustment for age, body mass index, age at menarche, number of children, smoking habits, socio-economic status and family history of BC as first-level covariates and urbanization level as the contextual variable.Increasing DII score showed significant positive associations with BC risk (OR(tertile3vs.tertile1) 1.34; 95%CI 1.05, 1.70). The association was stronger in overweight and obese women (OR(tertile3vs.tertile1) 1.98; 95%CI 1.86, 2.10). The DII effect on BC was higher with increased urbanization.A pro-inflammatory diet, reflected by higher DII scores, was positively associated with BC, especially in overweight women and with increased urbanization.",

METHOD: A total of 56 children aged between 4 and 12 years, diagnosed with PFAPA and undergoing tonsillectomy with/without adenoidectomy at a tertiary hospital were included in the study. The Questionnaire for Quality of Life Assessment for Children and Adolescents Parent Form (Kid-KINDL) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ) were used to evaluate quality of life and emotional/behavioural problems, respectively. The cases were assessed before and three months after surgery. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the children was 6.64 (3.03) years, and 58.9% (n = 33) were boys. The numbers of pre- and post-operative periodic fever episodes were 3.0 (1.7) and 0.6 (0.9) (p < 0.001), those for school absenteeism were 10.28 (5.53) and 2.85 (2.95) days (p < 0.001) and those for hospital presentations were 3.8 (2.5) and 1.1 (1.1) (p < 0.001), respectively, all of which were significantly lower in children with PFAPA at three months after the operation. The surgical procedures were effective in improving quality of life and emotional/behavioural problems, as evidenced by the significant differences between the pre- and post-treatment scores in outcome measures, including SDQ and Kid-KINDL (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the surgical approach exhibited positive effects in terms of improving quality of life and reducing emotional/behavioural problems and school absenteeism in children with PFAPA.",

GS deficiency, caused by pathogenic variants in the glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) gene, is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by systemic glutamine deficiency, persistent moderate hyperammonemia, and clinically devastating seizures and multi-organ failure shortly after birth. The four cases reported thus far were caused by homozygous GLUL missense variants. We report a case of GS deficiency caused by homozygous GLUL gene deletion, diagnosed prenatally and likely representing the most severe end of the spectrum. We expand the known phenotype of this rare condition with novel dysmorphic, radiographic and neuropathologic features identified on post-mortem examination. The biallelic deletion identified in this case also included the RNASEL gene and was associated with immune dysfunction in the fetus. This case demonstrates that total absence of the GLUL gene in humans is viable beyond the embryonic period, despite the early embryonic lethality found in GLUL animal models.",

Female C57BL/6J mice, aged 12\u202fmonths, fed a commercial chow were used in this study. The ISC function, ISC niche, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and intestinal immune function were assessed. Energy restriction reversed aging-induced intestinal shortening and made the crypts shallower. The intestinal epithelial cells isolated from the intestine showed a significant increase in the expression levels of stem cell-associated genes in small intestinal epithelial cells as detected by flow cytometry. Despite the increase in the number of stem cells and the expression levels of markers, no increase or decrease was found in the enteroid complexity of the small intestine and colonic enteroid formation in vitro. The colonic mucous layer was measured in mice of the energy restricted (ER)-treated group to investigate the epithelial barrier function in the colon. The results revealed that the barrier was more complete. The fluorescence intensity of tight junction markers claudin-2 and zonula occludens-1 increased and the mRNA expression profiles of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and interleukin-6 decreased in the colon of mice in the ER-treated group. The beneficial effects of ER on the colon in terms of the integrity of the mucosal barrier and alleviation of inflammation were confirmed, thus highlighting the importance of modulating the intestinal function in developing effective antiaging dietary interventions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord infarction due to interruption of the spinal vascular supply during anterior thoracolumbar surgery is a rare but devastating complication. Here, the authors sought to summarize the data on this complication in terms of its incidence, risk factors, and operative considerations. They also sought to summarize the relevant spinal vascular anatomy. METHODS: They performed a systematic literature review of the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to identify reports of spinal cord vascular injury related to anterior thoracolumbar spine procedures as well as operative adjuncts and considerations related to management of the segmental artery ligation during such anterior procedures. Titles and abstracts were screened, and studies meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed in full. RESULTS: Of 1200 articles identified on the initial screening, 16 met the inclusion criteria and consisted of 2 prospective cohort studies, 10 retrospective cohort studies, and 4 case reports. Four studies reported on the incidence of spinal cord ischemia with anterior thoracolumbar surgery, which ranged from 0% to 0.75%. Eight studies presented patient-level data for 13 cases of spinal cord ischemia after anterior thoracolumbar spine surgery. Proposed risk factors for vasculogenic spinal injury with anterior thoracolumbar surgery included hyperkyphosis, prior spinal deformity surgery, combined anterior-posterior procedures, left-sided approaches, operating on the concavity side of a scoliotic curve, and intra- or postoperative hypotension. In addition, eight studies analyzed operative considerations to reduce spinal cord ischemic complications in anterior thoracolumbar surgery, including intraoperative neuromonitoring and preoperative spinal angiography. CONCLUSIONS: While spinal cord infarction related to anterior thoracolumbar surgery is rare, it warrants proper consideration in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods. The spine surgeon must be aware of the relevant risk factors as well as the pre- and intraoperative adjuncts that can minimize these risks. Most importantly, an understanding of the relevant spinal vascular anatomy is critical to minimizing the risks associated with anterior thoracolumbar spine surgery.",

        "abstract": "Extracranial carotid artery stenosis (ECAS) due to the presence of atherosclerotic plaque is a well-known risk factor for stroke. Several structural imaging studies have investigated the effect of ECAS on the brain, focusing on structural damage (in particular cerebral small vessel disease) and on the rearrangement of the cerebral circulation. For example, it is known from the literature an association between carotid stenosis and cerebral small vessel disease, and it is also noted that a series of compensatory mechanisms are activated by the cerebrovascular system in order to overcome the cerebral hypoperfusion that is induced by the ECAS. Several neurocognitive studies have also investigated the association of ECAS with cognitive deficits. While the evidence tends to favor a direct association between ECAS and cognition, the actual relationship remains controversial. In the last decade, various resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc) magnetic resonance (MR) studies have tried to elucidate the \"in vivo\" mechanisms underlying the cognitive impairment observed in these patients. Although these studies have been performed on small cohorts of patients without standardized protocols, it is plausible that in the future, such studies will help find early stage markers of cognitive impairment. This could permit an extension of indications for revascularization for the treatment of cognitive impairment in selected patients. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the current knowledge on the effects of ECAS on brain and cognition by analyzing the main evidence from animal and clinical studies, with a special focus on rs-fc MR studies.",

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a challenge in the medical field due to its high malignancy and mortality rates particularly for HCC, which has developed multidrug resistance. Therefore, the identification of efficient chemotherapeutic drugs for multidrug resistant HCC has become an urgent issue. Natural products have always been of significance in drug discovery. In the present study, a cell-based method was used to screen a natural compound library, which consisted of 78 compounds, and the doxorubicin-resistant cancer cell line, HepG2/ADM, as screening tools. The findings of the present study led to the shortlisting of one of the compounds, digitoxin, which displayed an inhibitory effect on HepG2/ADM cells, with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 132.65+/-3.83, 52.29+/-6.26, and 9.13+/-3.67 nM for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Immunofluorescence, western blotting and cell cycle analyses revealed that digitoxin induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest via the serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR (ATR)-serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk2 (CHK2)-M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 (CDC25C) signaling pathway in HepG2/ADM cells, which may have resulted from a DNA double-stranded break. Digitoxin also induced mitochondrial apoptosis, which was characterized by changes in the interaction between Bcl-2 and Bax, the release of cytochrome c, as well as the activation of the caspase-3 and -9. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report that digitoxin displays an anti-HCC effect on HepG2/ADM cells through G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, which was mediated by the ATR-CHK2-CDC25C signaling pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis. Therefore, digitoxin could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with HCC.",

        "abstract": "Previous research suggests that mortality rates behave pro-cyclically with respect to economic growth, with suicides representing a notable exception that consistently increase in economic downturns. Over recent years, there is ample evidence in the literature that the working environment in the US has deteriorated significantly, suggesting that suicide rates may not necessarily behave in a counter-cyclical manner with business performance. Utilising recent suicide data, this study empirically tests the hypothesis that adverse working conditions over recent years may have resulted in a pro-cyclical relationship between business performance and suicide. Unlike previous studies, we use a stock market index, a leading macroeconomic indicator, to measure economic conditions from a business perspective. We employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) co-integration methodology to study the long-run relationship between monthly S&P500 stock market data and age and gender-specific suicide rates during the period January 1999 to July 2017. Our results highlight substantial differences in age groups responses to fluctuations in business performance. We find a clear positive association between business performance and suicide rates for the youngest males and females aged 15-34 years, indicating that there is a human cost associated with improved business performance. Additionally, we investigate the association between economic insecurity, a unique aspect of the recent deterioration in the working environment, using the Implied Volatility Index \"VIX\" and age and gender-specific suicide rates. Our findings do not support a population-wide adverse impact of economic insecurity on suicide incidences. The exception was males aged 15-24, and females aged 55-64 for whom we find a significant positive association. Teaching work-life management and problem-solving skills to manage everyday work stressors may be important strategies to mitigate the psychological cost of business successes.",

Despite several reports of GPP cases treated with intensive GMA, the efficacy of intensive GMA has not been verified in GPP. Herein, we present two GPP patients with a mutation in the IL36RN gene, who initially received regular GMA, and intensive GMA upon recurrence. There were no adverse effects during regular and intensive GMA for both patients. Because concomitant medication was only prednisolone (20 mg/day) during regular and intensive GMA, intensive GMA showed superiority to regular GMA in patient 1. Although concomitant medications were different between regular and intensive GMA in patient 2, these drugs had been used before the start of each GMA therapy. We cannot neglect the effects of concomitant drugs, but we observed a shorter time to remission in intensive GMA than that in regular GMA in both patients. More case studies will be necessary for evaluating the clinical efficacy of intensive GMA.",

        "abstract": "Students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit challenges with reading development. Evidence-based interventions and specialized approaches to reading instruction are currently being implemented across educational contexts for learners with ASD (Machalicek et al., 2008), yet there is limited understanding of how core ASD features may impact effective delivery of instruction and student participation. We begin to address this need by evaluating the reciprocity between instructional talk and student participation within a reading intervention utilizing a scripted language approach that was being piloted on students with ASD. Method This study used archival video-recorded observations from the beginning of a reading intervention to examine the interactions between 20 students (18 boys, two girls) with ASD (7-11 years old, M = 9.10, SD = 1.74) and their interventionists (n = 7). Lag sequential analysis was used to examine the frequency of student initiations and responses following the interventionists' use of responsive, open-ended, closed-ended, and directive language. Results Findings describe the types of and illustrate the variability in interactions between students and their interventionists, as well as highlight language categories that are linked to student participation. Conclusions These data provide a snapshot of the nature and quality of interactions between students with ASD and their interventionists. Findings suggest that delivery of instruction, including the language that interventionists use, may be an important area of focus when evaluating the effectiveness of reading-based practices across educational settings for learners with ASD, even within the confines of highly structured interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Household food insecurity has been associated with pregnancy complications and poorer birth outcomes in the United States and with maternal mental disorders in the United Kingdom, but there has been little investigation of the effects of food insecurity during this life stage in Canada. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the relationship between the food insecurity status of women during pregnancy and maternal and birth outcomes and health in infancy in Canada. METHODS: We drew on data from 1998 women in Ontario, Canada, whose food insecurity was assessed using the Household Food Security Survey Module on the Canadian Community Health Survey, cycles 2005 to 2011-2012. These records were linked to multiple health administrative databases to identify indications of adverse health outcomes during pregnancy, at birth, and during children's first year of life. We included women who gave birth between 9 months prior and 6 months after their interview date, and for whom infant outcome data were available. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to compare outcomes by maternal food security status, expressed as adjusted relative risks (aRR) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: While pregnant, 5.6% of women were marginally food insecure and 10.0% were moderately or severely food insecure. Food insecurity was unrelated to pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes, but 26.8% of women with moderate or severe food insecurity had treatment for postpartum mental disorders in the 6-month postpartum period, compared to 13.9% of food-secure women (aRR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.40-2.46). Children born to food-insecure mothers were at elevated risk of being treated in an emergency department in the first year of life (aRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal food insecurity during pregnancy in Ontario, Canada, is associated with postpartum mental disorders and a greater likelihood of infants being treated in an emergency department.",

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study between 1 March and 30 April 2020 to assess the importance of vitamin D deficiency in older patients with COVID-19. The cohort consisted of patients aged >/=65 years presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (n=105). All patients were tested for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels during acute illness. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed via viral reverse transcriptase PCR swab or supporting radiological evidence. COVID-19-positive arm (n=70) was sub-divided into vitamin D-deficient (</=30 nmol/L) (n=39) and -replete groups (n=35). Subgroups were assessed for disease severity using biochemical, radiological and clinical markers. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were laboratory features of cytokine storm, thoracic imaging changes and requirement of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). RESULTS: COVID-19-positive arm demonstrated lower median serum 25(OH)D level of 27 nmol/L (IQR=20-47 nmol/L) compared with COVID-19-negative arm, with median level of 52 nmol/L (IQR=31.5-71.5 nmol/L) (p value=0.0008). Among patients with vitamin D deficiency, there was higher peak D-dimer level (1914.00 mugFEU/L vs 1268.00 mugFEU/L) (p=0.034) and higher incidence of NIV support and high dependency unit admission (30.77% vs 9.68%) (p=0.042). No increased mortality was observed between groups. CONCLUSION: Older adults with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 may demonstrate worse morbidity outcomes. Vitamin D status may be a useful prognosticator.",

        "abstract": "Volatile losses of hydrophobic organic contaminants from a confined disposal facility (CDF) containing dredged contaminated sediments is of substantial concern to surrounding communities. A partitioning passive sampling approach using polyoxymethylene (POM) was applied to measure long-term average (weeks to months) air concentrations resulting from evaporation at a CDF. Measurements at 10 locations surrounding the CDF using the POM air samplers indicated that the highest concentrations of SigmaPCBs approximately 13 ng/m(3) and SigmaPAHs  approximately 65 ng/m(3) were measured during an active dredge material placement period when the average temperature was 23  degrees C. The measurements were dominated by the more volatile, lower molecular weight compounds of each type. Partitioning to the POM during the post dredge material placement period with average temperature of 5  degrees C was corrected for temperature and the measured  summation operatorPCBs and  summation operatorPAHs were  approximately 3 ng/m(3) and 45 ng/m(3) respectively. The partitioning passive sampling measurements agreed well with the available weekly 24-h high-volume air samples (HVAS) averaged over the POM equilibration time for lower congener number PCBs (15, 18, 20/28 and 31) and naphthalene but were as much as 10 times lower than HVAS for high molecular weight PAHs. The difference was likely the result of the greater association of these PAHs with particulates and sources other than evaporation from the CDF. The POM air sampler achieved the goal of providing a long-term average air concentration without having to collect, analyze and average multiple HVAS samples although the technique is largely limited to the lower molecular weight PAHs and PCBs and different equilibration times for different compounds complicate its use and analysis.",

Intensive efforts have demonstrated light-triggered production of different solar fuels, such as H(2) , CO, CH(4) and NH(3) , while research on oxidative half-reactions has built up from O(2) generation to organic synthesis, waste degradation and photo-reforming. Nevertheless, while extensive utilization of the radiant chemical potential to promote a manifold of endergonic processes is the common thread of such research, exploration of the chemical space is fragmented by the lack of a common language across different scientific disciplines.

Compartments and compartmental boundaries were discovered by lineage studies in the model organism Drosophila. Since then, many compartment boundaries have been identified in developing tissues, from insects to vertebrates. These are important for animal development, because boundaries localize signalling centres that control tissue morphogenesis. Compartment boundaries are boundaries of lineage restriction, where specific mechanisms keep boundaries straight and cells segregated. Here, we review the mechanisms of cell sorting at boundaries found in early Drosophila embryos. The parasegmental boundaries, separating anterior from posterior compartments in the embryo, keep cells segregated by increasing actomyosin contractility at boundary cell-cell interfaces. Differential actomyosin contractility in turn promotes fold formation and orients cell division. Earlier in development, actomyosin differentials are also important for cell sorting during axis extension. Specific cell surface asymmetries and signalling pathways are required to initiate and maintain these actomyosin differentials.",

To investigate the influence of vibration-assisted drilling (VAD) methods on the temperature increase during bone drilling and the causes for temperature increase, drilling experiments were performed on fresh bovine femur samples. The morphology and granularity distribution of the generated bone chips were innovatively used to directly compare the machining processes and thermal conditions of conventional drilling (CD), low-frequency vibration-assisted drilling (LFVAD), and ultrasonic vibration-assisted drilling (UVAD). The experimental results indicated that LFVAD produced the lowest temperature increase of 31.4 degrees C, whereas UVAD produced the highest temperature increase of 44.1 degrees C with the same drilling parameters. Additionally, the morphologies and granularity distributions of the bone chips significantly differed among these methods. We concluded that the smaller temperature increase in LFVAD was mainly attributed to the improved thermal conditions resulting from the periodic cutting/separation motion and the reliable geometric chip-breaking mechanism. In contrast, the unfavourable thermal conditions of UVAD were caused by the higher applied frequency, which created a significantly larger amount of friction heat. This was the main cause for the highest observed temperature increase, resulting in bone crushing processes that generated additional heat.",

In recent years, it has been applied in the treatment of lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. METHODS: The screening of bioactive compounds, acquisition of drug targets, network construction, and experimental validation in vivo were combined to explored the mechanism of FTF in the treatment of lung carcinoma with regards to systems pharmacology. RESULTS: The network Lung Cancer Pathway consisted of 114 nodes (44 compounds and 70 potential targets) and 361 edges, as well as modules that included inflammatory response, angiogenesis, negative regulation of the apoptotic process, and positive regulation of cell proliferation and migration. It was examined by conducting experiments that involved the administration of ethanol-based extracts of FTF in Lewis lung carcinoma mice. The extracts exerted excellent anti-lung cancer effects in vivo by significantly inhibiting tumor proliferation, thereby extending the survival period of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, FTF induced the downregulation of PIK3CG, Bcl-2, eNOS, VEGF, p-STAT3, and STAT3 genes in tumor-bearing mice. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study verify the therapeutic effects and mechanism of FTF on lung cancer and provide a theoretical basis to support the comprehensive utilization of FTF resources.",

In the present study, we want to discover an old drug as an inhibitor of 6PGD for suppressing tumor growth. METHODS: We determined the expression of 6PGD in cancer tissues using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) profiles and explored the importance of 6PGD expression in cancer progression by using Kaplan-Meier Plotter. We identified Ebselen as a 6PGD inhibitor by using 6PGD in vitro enzyme activity assay. Cell viability, cell proliferation, tumor growth and cell metabolism assay were used to explore the role of 6PGD and its inhibitor in cancer cells. RESULTS: We found that the expression of 6PGD was upregulated in different cancer tissues and it can promote tumorigenesis. Here, we analyzed our 6PGD inhibitor screening data again and found an old drug Ebselen, which blocks cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by inhibiting 6PGD enzyme activity, while knocking down 6PGD would partially abolish the inhibition of Ebselen on cell proliferation and cell metabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the conventional drug Ebselen could serve as a novel inhibitor of 6PGD for suppressing cancer growth by inhibiting 6PGD enzyme activity.",

In this context, several years ago, we developed a hybrid molecular mechanics (MM)/coarse-grained (CG) approach to predict ligand poses in low-resolution hGPCR models. The approach was based on the GROMOS96 43A1 and PRODRG united-atom force fields for the MM part. Here, we present a new MM/CG implementation using, instead, the Amber 14SB and GAFF all-atom potentials for proteins and ligands, respectively. The new implementation outperforms the previous one, as shown by a variety of applications on models of hGPCR/ligand complexes at different resolutions, and it is also more user-friendly. Thus, it emerges as a useful tool to predict poses in low-resolution models and provides insights into ligand binding similarly to all-atom molecular dynamics, albeit at a lower computational cost.",

Belem is the smallest and most deforested area of endemism in the biome.

The aim of this research was to analyze connectivity among the Belem's remaining forest fragments and to classify them according to their importance for population dispersal. We used morphological spatial pattern analysis to characterize landscape structure and the integral index of connectivity to defi ne the importance of forest fragments. From a structural perspective, 55.28% of the forested area was classifi ed as core, 16.88% as edge. From a functional perspective, few fragments were classifi ed as highly important. In general, larger fragments were more important for connectivity. The protected areas seem to not have considered the forest connectivity in their planning, although the designation of priority areas has valued this variable. This study provides an important theoretical outline for considering connectivity in the planning phase and represents a contribution to more detailed research on how to maintain biodiversity in the Belem Area of Endemism.",

To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of the orf1ab polyprotein from the NCBI virus database from affected patients across various states of the United States from December 2019 to 25 April 2020.

Additionally, the effect of surgical therapy on survival after vertebral compression fractures remains controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the preoperative factors that affected the long-term survival of patients who underwent spinal surgery for an insufficient union following osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVF) and to determine postoperative mortality. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 105 consecutive patients who underwent spinal surgery for OVF. Mortality was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test. The preoperative backgrounds of patients were analyzed to determine which risk factors led to death among the OVF cases. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival based on preoperative albumin levels of </=3.5 g/dL (hypoalbuminemia) versus > 3.5 mg/dL. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 4.1 +/- 0.8 years. Two years after surgery, percentage of patients who had died was 15%. The VAS scores and modified Frankel classification were significantly improved one year after surgery. The ratio of male-to-female was significantly higher for patients with OVF who died than for those who were still alive. No significant difference in mortality was observed among surgical procedures for OVF. The univariate analysis showed that male gender, serum albumin < 3.5 g/dl, creatinine clearance< 60 mg/dl, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists classificat0ion >/=3 were significant risk factors for postoperative mortality. Multivariate analysis revealed that only serum albumin </=3.5 g/dL was a significant risk factor for long-term postoperative mortality of patients with OVF. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative hypoalbuminemia was associated with postoperative mortality following surgery for OVF. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of preventable death among children under-five in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Ethiopia, diarrhea is the major contributor to deaths for children under the age of 5 years. In order to develop prevention strategies for the alleviation of childhood diarrhea, it is necessary to identify the important predisposing factors. These predisposing factors have been observed to vary by location across Eastern Ethiopia. Moreover, the evidence on prevalence and determinants of diarrhea among children under 5 years of age in Dire Dawa and its suburbs is very limited and those available have been erratic. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and predisposing factors of diarrhea among children under the age of 5 years in rural Dire Dawa, East Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in rural Dire Dawa City Administration in May 2018. Multistage sampling technique was employed to recruit 1180 under-five children from the rural population of Dire Dawa City Administration. Data on socio-demographic, environmental, and child hygiene-related factors were collected by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for childhood diarrhea. RESULTS: The 2-week prevalence of diarrhea among the under-five children was 23% (95% CI 20.8-25.7%). Maternal diarrhea (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.10-4.47), handwashing after contact with child feces (AOR = 6.27, 95% CI 2.01-19.55), use of a dipper to draw water from containers (AOR = 2.88, 95% CI 1.41-5.89), and presence of a refuse disposal facility (AOR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.09-5.60) were the significant predisposing factors of diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Our study identified a high burden of childhood diarrheal disease in rural Dire Dawa City Administration in Eastern Ethiopia. The identified risk factors were maternal diarrhea, handwashing after contact with child feces, use of a dipper to draw water from containers, and presence of refuse disposal facility. To minimize the risk of diarrhea, health education programs focusing on good hygiene practice and sanitation as well as early treatment are recommended.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trauma patients admitted to critical care are at high risk of mortality because of their injuries. Our aim was to develop a machine learning-based model to predict mortality using Fahad-Liaqat-Ahmad Intensive Machine (FLAIM) framework. We hypothesized machine learning could be applied to critically ill patients and would outperform currently used mortality scores. METHODS: The current Deep-FLAIM model evaluates the statistically significant risk factors and then supply these risk factors to deep neural network to predict mortality in trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We analyzed adult patients (>/=18 years) admitted to the trauma ICU in the publicly available database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III version 1.4. The first phase selection of risk factor was done using Cox-regression univariate and multivariate analyses. In the second phase, we applied deep neural network and other traditional machine learning models like Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Model, and k-nearest neighbor models. RESULTS: We identified a total of 3,041 trauma patients admitted to the trauma surgery ICU. We observed that several clinical and laboratory-based variables were statistically significant for both univariate and multivariate analyses while others were not. With most significant being serum anion gap (hazard ratio [HR], 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.94-3.11), sodium (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.61-2.77), and chloride (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.64) abnormalities on laboratories, while clinical variables included the diagnosis of sepsis (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.23-3.37), Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.32-3.76). And Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria (HR. 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.26). After we used these clinically significant variables and applied various machine learning models to the data, we found out that our proposed DNN outperformed all the other methods with test set accuracy of 92.25%, sensitivity of 79.13%, and specificity of 94.16%; positive predictive value, 66.42%; negative predictive value, 96.87%; and area under the curve of the receiver-operator curve of 0.91 (1.45-1.29). CONCLUSION: Our novel Deep-FLAIM model outperformed all other machine learning models. The model is easy to implement, user friendly and with high accuracy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic study, level II.",

We aimed to estimate incidence, clearance, and persistence of anal HR-HPV in HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM and TGW, and to assess factors for HR-HPV persistence. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: MSM and TGW aged at least 18 years, were enrolled from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, then followed up 6-monthly for 12 months. Anal swabs were collected at every visit for HR-HPV genotypes to define anal HR-HPV incidence, clearance, and persistence. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with HR-HPV persistence. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-five MSM and TGW were included in this study, of whom 72.3% were HIV-positive. The incidence of anal HR-HPV persistence was higher in HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM participants (28.4/1000 vs. 13.9/1000 person-months). HIV-positive participants had HR-HPV lower clearance rate than HIV-negative participants (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.7). The overall persistence of HR-HPV was 39.9% in HIV-positive and 22.8% HIV-negative participants. HPV-16 was the most persistent HR-HPV in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants. HIV infection (aOR 2.87; 95% CI 1.47-5.61), living in Kuala Lumpur (aOR 4.99; 95% CI 2.22-11.19) and Bali (aOR 3.39; 95% CI 1.07-10.75), being employed/freelance (aOR 3.99; 95% CI 1.48-10.77), and not being circumcised (aOR 2.29; 95% CI 1.07-4.88) were independently associated with anal HR-HPV persistence. CONCLUSION: HIV-positive MSM and TGW had higher risk of persistent anal HR-HPV infection. Prevention program should be made available and prioritized for HIV-positive MSM and TGW where resources are limited.",

However, few studies focused on the effect of granulation method of these two fertilizers on N supply to soil. To validate this effect, we mixed the CF ((15)N-(NH(4))(2)SO(4)) into cow manure powders with maize straw powder at rate of 2% or 8% (dry weight), respectively, in two forms, homogeneous granulation (HG) and spatial heterogeneous granulation (SG), and applied them to soil to investigate their difference in N transformations during an 80-day incubation. Results showed that there were more NH(4)(+), NO(3)(-) and microbial biomass N (MBN) in the SG granules and the surrounding soil, while more dissolved organic N (DON) in the HG granules and the corresponding soil after day 30. At day 80, compared to HG, SG released less CF-N into the surrounding soil, but primed more organic N into mineral N. Structural equation model (SEM) revealed that DON was the main form of N transported from fertilizer granules to the surrounding soil, and then drove the changes of soil microbial activity, which determined the amount and dynamic of mineral N in the surrounding soil. These results indicated that, in heterogeneous granulation, the spatial separation between OF and CF slow down, but more importantly enhanced up, the microbial transformation of CF in the granules. This demonstrated that the spatial heterogeneous granulation of OF and CF could change the pattern of N release from fertilizer to soil and offer a potential way to optimize N fertilizer management strategies in the future.",

        "abstract": "The zebrafish Danio rerio is a valuable and common model for scientists in the fields of genetics and developmental biology. Since zebrafish are also amenable to genetic manipulation, modelling of human diseases or behavioral experiments have moved into the focus of zebrafish research. Consequently, gene expression data beyond embryonic and larval stages become more important, yet there is a dramatic knowledge gap of gene expression beyond day four of development. Like in other model organisms, the visualization of spatial and temporal gene expression by whole mount in situ hybridization (ISH) becomes increasingly difficult when zebrafish embryos develop further and hence the growing tissues become dense and less permeable. Here we introduce a modified method for whole mount ISH, which overcomes these penetration and detection problem. The method is an all in one solution that enables the detection and visualization of gene expression patterns up to the late larval stage in a 3D manner without the need for tissue sectioning and offers a valuable extension for whole mount ISH by immunohistochemistry in the zebrafish field.",

METHODS: Narrative summary of case study describing the how, when, and why of implementing MCDA. RESULTS: Faced with a fixed budget, a pipeline of expensive but potentially valuable drugs, and potential delays to drug decision making, the Ministry of Health (i.e., decision makers) and its independent expert advisory committee (IAB) sought alternative values-based decision processes. MCDA was considered highly compatible with current processes, but the ability as a stand-alone intervention to address issues of opportunity cost was unclear. The IAB nevertheless collaboratively voted to implement an externally developed MCDA with support from decision makers. After several months of engagement and piloting, implementation was rapid and leveraged strong pre-existing formal and informal communication networks. The IAB as a whole rates new submissions which serves as an input into the deliberative process. CONCLUSIONS: MCDA can be a highly adaptable approach that can be implemented into a functioning drug reimbursement setting when facilitated by (i) a truly limited budget; (ii) a shared vision for change by end-users and decision makers; (iii) using pre-existing deliberative processes; and (iv) viewing the approach as a decision framework rather than the decision (when appropriate). Given the current limitations of MCDA, implementing an academically imperfect tool first and evaluating later reflects a practical solution to real-time fiscal constraints and impending delays to drug approvals that may be faced by decision makers.",

In this study, we examine the mediating role of alexithymia, impulsivity, and general psychological distress in the relationship between insecure attachment dimensions and technology addiction. Data were collected from 539 adolescents and young adults, mostly women (N = 378; 70.1 percent), aged 19.76 +/- 1.99 years. Participants completed self-report measures of attachment insecurity, psychological risk factors (i.e., impulsivity, psychological distress, and alexithymia), and technology addiction (i.e., problematic Internet use, smartphone, and Internet addiction). The gender-related (i.e., multi-group) mediation model was tested through a path analysis with both observed and latent variables. Attachment anxiety had no direct effect on technology addiction, whereas attachment avoidance had a small negative direct effect, but only among women. Insecure attachment dimensions were significantly associated with psychological risk factors, whereas the latter had a significant, direct association with technology addiction. Psychological risk factors significantly mediated the association between insecure attachment dimensions and technology addiction. Finally, the tested model was gender-invariant. Findings suggest that insecure attachment dimensions have an indirect effect on the development of technology addiction mediated almost entirely by higher levels of psychological risk factors. Such findings might have relevant implications to inform any treatment plan for young adults who are overinvolved with technology activities and so to deliver patient-tailored interventions.",

A major cause of EBI has been attributed that hematoma components invade into the brain parenchyma, resulting in neuronal cell death.

We describe here the clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) patterns in asymptomatic young patients who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study where 25 male in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Demographics, clinical data and CT images of these patients were reviewed by 2 senior radiologists. RESULTS: In total there were 25 patients (all males; mean age [+/-SD], 21.64+/-2.40 years; range, 18-27 years). Patients with abnormal chest CT showed a relatively low normal absolute lymphocytes count (median: 2.2 x 109/L) and absolute monocyte count (median: 0.5 x 109/L). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 5 (20%) of the patients. The procalcitonin level was normal while elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet and C-reactive protein were common. Baseline chest CT showed abnormalities in 6 patients. The distribution of the lesions were; upper lobe 3 (12%) lower lobe 3 (12%) with peripheral distribution 4 (16%). Of the 25 patients included, 4 (16%) had ground glass opacification (GGO), 1 (4%) had a small peripheral subpleural nodule, and 1 (4%) had a dense solitary granuloma. Four patients had typical CT features of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that the CT imaging showed peripheral GGO in our patients. They remained clinically stable with no deterioration of their respiratory symptoms suggesting stability in lung involvement. We postulate that rapid changes in CT imaging may not be present in young, asymptomatic, non-smoking COVID-19 patients. Thus the use of CT thoraxfor early diagnosis may be reserved for patients in the older agegroups, and not in younger patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the posterior longitudinal ligament is one of the tissue candidates who can contribute to low back pain (LBP). METHODS: This is a retrospective study. A series of 72 patients who underwent single-level percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy performed for lumbar disc herniation with LBP from June 2014 to June 2016 were examined. There are 42 males and 30 females. The ages of patients were 40 to 57 years, and the mean age was 49.8 years. The symptomatic disc level was at L(4-5) in 43 patients and L(5) S(1) in 29 patients. Thirty-two patients (19 patients in L(4-5) disc level, 13 patients in L(5) S(1) disc level) had LBP (which was limited to the lower back and buttock area) before the operation. All of the operative approaches were performed under local anesthesia. A posterior body diagram (15 cm x 10 cm) was made for this study to record the pain distribution. The centered foci of low back pain were subjectively recorded before, during, and after the operation. The transforaminal endoscopic spine system technology was used in this study. Radiological examinations (X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) were performed prior to and after surgery. The Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were taken before and after the surgery to observe the degree of pain. The VSA and ODI score before and after operation were expressed as mean +/- SD, and compared by t-test for statistical analysis. RESULTS: When inciting the posterior longitudinal ligament during the operation, all 72 patients had provoked low back pain. Forty-three patients with symptomatic discs at L(4-5) had pain foci in the lower back and upper gluteal region under the L(4) spinous process. Twenty-nine patients with symptomatic discs at L(5) S(1) had pain foci in the gluteal region under the S(1) spinous process. The pain localizations of L(4-5) and L(5) S(1) were different. After the surgery, the provoked low back pain disappeared, and had not returned in any of the patients at the 6-month follow-up. After the operation, one patient suffered from lower limb pain that he did not have before the operation, and the lower limb pain abated a few days later. Three patients had cerebrospinal fluid leakage and were treated with higher pressure applied on the incision and bed rest for 10 days. During the 6-months follow-up period, the mean VAS decreased from 5.97 +/- 1.10 to 2.13 +/- 0.78. The mean ODI score decreased from 23.14 +/- 3.28 to 7.92 +/- 1.85. CONCLUSIONS: The intervertebral posterior longitudinal ligament may be one of the tissues from which low back pain originates.",

        "abstract": "MCL1 is an important antiapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family that is distinguishable from other family members based on its relatively short half-life. Emerging studies have revealed the crucial role of MCL1 in the chemoresistance of cancer cells. The antiapoptotic function of MCL1 makes it a popular therapeutic target, although specific inhibitors have begun to emerge only recently. Notably, emerging studies have reported that several E3 ligases and deubiquitinases modulate MCL1 stability, providing an alternate means of targeting MCL1 activity. In addition, the emergence and development of proteolysis-targeting chimeras, the function of which is based on ubiquitination-mediated degradation, has shown great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies investigating the ubiquitination and deubiquitination of MCL1, summarize the latest evidence regarding the development of therapeutic strategies targeting MCL1 in cancer treatment, and discuss the promising future of targeting MCL1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system in clinical practice.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online survey for new members of the Japanese Society for Radiation Oncology (JASTRO). RESULTS: The response rate was 43.3%. Data of the 79 respondents who wanted to obtain a board-certification of JASTRO were analysed. We divided the respondents into two groups: Group A, those who entered a single radiation oncology department, and Group B, those who joined a radiology department in which the radiation oncology department and diagnostic radiology department were integrated. The most common period when respondents were most attracted to radiation oncology was \"5th year of university\" in Group A and \"2nd year of junior residency\" and \"senior residency\" in Group B. Furthermore, 79.5% of Group A and 40% of Group B chose periods before graduation from a university with a significant difference. The most common period when respondents made up their minds to become radiation oncologists was \"2nd year of junior residency\" in both groups. Internal medicine was the most common department to consider if they did not join the radiation oncology or radiology department. CONCLUSION: To increase the radiation oncologists, it is crucial to enhance clinical training in the fifth year of university for Group A and to continue an active approach to maintain interest in radiation oncology until the end of junior residency. In Group B facilities, it is desirable to provide undergraduates more opportunities to come in contact with radiation oncology.",

It was located approximately 100 km south-east of Zagreb on the banks of the Sava River. Although the purpose of, and number of deaths in, the camp have been debated, it appears that a significant number of Serbs, Roma and Jews died and/or were executed at this site between 1941 and 1945. The site demonstrates that not all detention camps at this time were controlled by the German government and that cultural/religious groups other than the Jews were detainees. Balkan mass graves may therefore derive from different conflicts at different times, and so establishing accurate conclusions from excavations often requires a verifiable and plausible context and an understanding of burial processes."

There is a lack of data about COVID-19 in older adults. The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of older adult patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective study of older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from February 1 st to March 31 st, 2020 was conducted in the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongjing Hospital in Wuhan, China. According to the degree of severity of COVID-19 during hospitalization, 312 older patients were divided into non-severe and severe cases. RESULTS: the mean age of the patients was 69.2 +/- 7.3 years, and 47.4 % of patients had exposure history. 77.2 % of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (57.1 %), followed by diabetes (38.8 %) and cardiovascular disease (29.8 %). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe COVID-19 associated with age(OR 1.59, 95 %CI 1.13-2.08), SOFA score(OR 5.89, 95 %CI 3.48-7.96), APACHE\u2161 score(OR 3.13, 95 %CI 1.85-5.62), platelet count\uff1c125 x 10(9)/L(OR 2.36, 95 %CI 1.03-4.14), d-dimer (OR 4.37, 95 %CI 2.58-7.16), creatinine\uff1e133 mumol/L(OR 1.85, 95 %CI 1.12-3.04), interleukin-6(OR 4.32, 95 %CI 2.07-7.13), and lung consolidation(OR 1.94, 95 %CI 1.45-4.27) on admission. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (35.6 %), followed by acute cardiac injury (33.0 %) and coagulation disorders (30.8 %). 91.7 % of patients were prescribed antiviral therapy, followed by immune globulin (52.9 %) and systemic glucocorticoids (43.6 %). 21.8 % of patients received invasive ventilation, 1.92 % for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The overall mortality was 6.73 %, and mortality of severe patients was 17.1 %, which was higher than non-severe patients (0.962 %). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with COVID-19 had much more co-morbidity, complications and mortality. More attention should be paid to older patients with COVID-19.",

DESIGN: Single-center, prospective cohort study of women undergoing TOR from July 2017 to January 2018. SETTING: This study was conducted in an academic public hospital. PATIENT(S): Women with </=15 follicles for retrieval were eligible. Women with body mass index > 35, difficult vaginal approach, endometrioma > 5 cm, or pelvic inflammatory disease were excluded. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Our primary endpoint was patient satisfaction. Secondary endpoints were women's willingness to recommend or undergo the procedure again without anesthesia, anxiety levels before the procedure, expected level of pain, actual pain levels during the procedure, and gynecologist's level of difficulty or technical compromise. RESULT(S): During the study period, 500 TORs were performed, of which 402 (80%) were screened for study eligibility. Overall, data were analyzed for 50 eligible women who had their first in vitro fertilization cycle (participating in the study) without anesthesia. High rates of satisfaction were reported, and 90% would recommend the procedure without anesthesia to their friends. Physicians graded the difficulty of the procedure as very easy in 35 procedures; in only two procedures was difficulty reported. CONCLUSION(S): TOR without anesthesia is feasible, with a relatively high satisfaction rate from both patients and gynecologists, suggesting that it should be considered in selected women.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Increased postprandial lipemia (PPL) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) is an endogenous inhibitor of the LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) pathway. We previously showed that PCSK9 inhibition in mice reduces PPL. However, the relative contribution of intracellular intestinal PCSK9 or liver-derived circulating PCSK9 to this effect is still unclear. Approach and Results: To address this issue, we generated the first intestine-specific Pcsk9-deficient (i-Pcsk9(-/-)) mouse model. PPL was measured in i-Pcsk9(-/-) as well as in wild-type and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice following treatment with a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (alirocumab). Blocking the circulating form of PCSK9 with alirocumab significantly reduced PPL, while overexpressing human PCSK9 in the liver of full Pcsk9(-/-) mice had the opposite effect. Alirocumab regulated PPL in a LDLR-dependent manner as this effect was abolished in Ldlr(-/-) mice. In contrast, i-Pcsk9(-/-) mice did not exhibit alterations in plasma lipid parameters nor in PPL. Finally, PPL was highly exacerbated by streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus in Pcsk9(+/+) but not in Pcsk9(-/-) mice, an effect that was mimicked by the use of alirocumab in streptozotocin-treated Pcsk9(+/+) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrate that PPL is significantly altered by full but not intestinal PCSK9 deficiency. Treatment with a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody mimics the effect of PCSK9 deficiency on PPL suggesting that circulating PCSK9 rather than intestinal PCSK9 is a critical regulator of PPL. These data validate the clinical relevance of PCSK9 inhibitors to reduce PPL, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Particular attention was focused both on determining the impact of the amount and the molecular weight of the crosslinker used for the synthesis as well as on the introduced additive on the properties of hydrogels. It was proven that modified hydrogels exhibited higher swelling ability. Introduced additive affected the tensile strength of hydrogels-modified materials showed 23% higher elongation. The greater amount of the crosslinker used in the synthesis, the more compact the structure, leading to the lower elasticity and lower sorption of hydrogels was reported. Above 95%, murine fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h incubation with hydrogels. It indicates that tested materials did not exhibit cytotoxicity toward these lines. Additionally, materials with Aloe vera juice were characterized by lower surface roughness.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite the prevalence of mental illness among young adults in South Africa, few studies have examined its correlation with social capital using nationally representative data. Sources of social capital are different for youth, which is why understanding the correlation between family and neighbourhood social capital and mental health outcomes is important for designing optimal interventions. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between social capital and youth mental health. We also sought to understand whether family social capital was more protective for the mental health of youth compared to neighbourhood social capital. METHODS: Using the National Income Dynamics Survey data for South Africa, we examine these associations among 2307 youth aged 15-24 across the four waves. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine these associations. RESULTS: Our findings emphasize the substantial burden of mental illness among youth in South Africa (26% in wave 4). Although results for parental presence were not significant, family social capital measured by household income significantly decreased the odds of incident depression only for those belonging to the third quintile (aOR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54-1.01). High perception of crime in the neighbourhood was associated with significantly higher odds of incident depression (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.67). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the independent effect of neighbourhood characteristics on youth mental health and did not support family social capital as being protective for developing depression. This implies that youth program planners must focus on community context in improving youth developmental outcomes such as mental health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy in the form of either dialysis or transplantation is the only option for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Blood-borne infections such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are of special concern in these patients because of their high incidence. Although there are sufficient data from the developed world, there is scarcity of data from developing countries such as India. METHODS: All newly diagnosed ESRD patients initiated on hemodialysis after attending the Department of Nephrology, PGIMER, Chandigarh between January 2015 and October 2015 were included in the study. All the subjects were initially screened for HCV and HBV serology status and subsequent HCV and HBV status on follow-up at the end of 6 months and evaluated by standardized precoded questionnaires and biochemical examinations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to identify the risk factors for seroconversion. RESULTS: A total of 196 patients were recruited for the study after confirming seronegative status. At the end of 6 months, 61 patients lost to follow-up. Anti-HCV antibody had shown moderate association to HCV RNA testing at the end of 6 months by kappa test. Out of 135, 16.3% seroconverted to HCV RNA positive and 0.7% patient became hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Isolation of dialysis machine and nursing staff was associated with lower seroconversion. CONCLUSION: In a real-life scenario, HCV seroconversion is observed in 15% of the patients initiated on hemodialysis. Isolation of both dialysis machine and personnel was associated with lower seroconversion.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human are widely exposed to multiple metals, some of which have suspected reproductive toxicity, but no human studies have investigated the developmental effects of prenatal metal exposure. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the associations between prenatal multiple metal exposure and reproductive development in boys at 2-3 years using multi-pollutant approach. METHODS: This prospective study used data of 564 mother-child pairs recruited from the Guangxi Birth Cohort Study. Twenty serum metal concentrations were measured. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized regression was used to identify independent associations between prenatal multiple metal exposure and testicular volume (TV), and anogenital distance (AGD). Adjusted estimates were then obtained using multiple linear regression analysis, and the regression tree method was used to explore the interactions. RESULTS: Boys in the highest quartile of prenatal lead exposure had a 0.064 mL (95% CI: -0.124, -0.004) smaller ln-transformed TV, 0.060 cm (95% CI: -0.110, -0.011) shorter ln-transformed anopenile distance (AGDap), and 0.115 cm (95% CI: -0.190, -0.039) shorter ln-transformed anoscrotal distance (AGDas) than boys in the lowest quartile (all Ptrend < 0.05). Chromium was inversely with ln-transformed AGDap (beta = -0.078, 95% CI: -0.127, -0.030) and ln-transformed AGDas (beta = -0.113, 95% CI: -0.188, -0.038), while stibium was positivity associated with ln-transformed AGDap (beta = 0.091, 95% CI: 0.046, 0.136) and strontium was positivity associated with ln-transformed AGDas (beta = 0.120, 95% CI: 0.051, 0.189) (all Ptrend < 0.05). And the critical window of vulnerability may be the late pregnancy (the second and third trimester). Moreover, we detected interaction effects between lead, chromium and stibium on AGDap; lead, chromium and strontium on AGDas. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that prenatal exposure to lead, chromium, stibium and strontium may affect TV and/or AGD in infant boys. Potential mechanisms for the complex metal interactive effects during vulnerable periods are worthy of further investigation.",

However, despite this close physical and biochemical relationship, the effects of mitochondrial dynamics on skeletal muscle contractility are poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1), an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission, on the structure and function of both mitochondria and myofibrils in skeletal muscle tissues engineered on micromolded gelatin hydrogels. Treatment with mdivi-1 did not alter myotube morphology, but did increase the mitochondrial turbidity and oxidative capacity, consistent with reduced mitochondrial fission. Mdivi-1 also significantly increased basal, twitch, and tetanus stresses, as measured using the Muscular Thin Film (MTF) assay. Finally, mdivi-1 increased sarcomere length, potentially due to mdivi-1-induced changes in mitochondrial volume and compression of myofibrils. Together, these results suggest that mdivi-1 increases contractile stress generation, which may be caused by an increase in maximal respiration and/or sarcomere length due to increased volume of individual mitochondria. These data reinforce that mitochondria have both biochemical and biomechanical roles in skeletal muscle and that mitochondrial dynamics can be manipulated to alter muscle contractility.",

        "abstract": "Non-human primate (NHP)-derived adenoviruses have formed a valuable alternative for the use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development and gene therapy strategies by virtue of the low seroprevalence of neutralizing immunity in the human population. The more recent use of several human adenoviruses as oncolytic agents has exhibited excellent safety profiles and firm evidence of clinical efficacy. This proffers the question whether NHP-derived adenoviruses could also be employed for viral oncolysis in human patients. While vaccine vectors are conventionally made as replication-defective vectors, in oncolytic applications replication-competent viruses are used. The data on NHP-derived adenoviral vectors obtained from vaccination studies can only partially support the suitability of NHP-derived adenoviruses for use in oncolytic virus therapy. In addition, the use of NHP-derived adenoviruses in humans might be received warily given the recent zoonotic infections with influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In this review, we discuss the similarities and differences between human- and NHP-derived adenoviruses in view of their use as oncolytic agents. These include their genome organization, receptor use, replication and cell lysis, modulation of the host's immune responses, as well as their pathogenicity in humans. Together, the data should facilitate a rational and data-supported decision on the suitability of NHP-derived adenoviruses for prospective use in oncolytic virus therapy.",

Based on the procedures in the Reyes et al.

Subsequently, we gradually faded therapists' instructions for 2 participants until they independently used the arousal suppression exercise.

Decreased sexual arousal continued even under conditions of faded therapist instructions for 2 participants. The relative merits of using self-report measures are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have been synthesized from a wide array of materials. The therapeutic success of these platforms hinges upon their ability to favorably interact with the biological environment (both systemically and locally) and recognize the diseased target tissue. The immune system, composed of a highly coordinated organization of cells trained to recognize foreign bodies, represents a key mediator of these interactions. Although components of this system may act as a barrier to nanoparticle (NP) delivery, the immune system can also be exploited to target and trigger signaling cues that facilitate the therapeutic response stemming from systemic administration of NPs. The nano-bio interface represents the key facilitator of this communication exchange, where the surface properties of NPs govern their in vivo fate. Cell membrane-based biomimetic nanoparticles have emerged as one approach to achieve targeted drug delivery by actively engaging and communicating with the biological milieu. In this review, we will highlight the relationship between these biomimetic nanoparticles and the immune system, emphasizing the role of tuning the nano-bio interface in the immunomodulation of diseases. We will also discuss the therapeutic applications of this approach with biomimetic nanoparticles, focusing on specific diseases ranging from cancer to infectious diseases. Lastly, we will provide a critical evaluation on the current state of this field of cell membrane-based biomimetic nanoparticles and its future directions in immune-based therapy.",

Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in late January of 2020 in our hospital. Cases 1 and 3 were diagnosed as mild and common type of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and survived from the viral infection. They acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during their staying in hospital under radiotherapy and surgery of the tumors. Cases 2 and 4 suffered from severe type of COVID-19, and Case 2 was dead owning to the advanced age, uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases. The immunosuppressive state induced by liver transplantation and anti-rejection therapy might contribute to the severity of COVID-19 in Case 4, who suffered from hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, Case 4 was recovered from COVID-19 after a combination therapy against virus, bacteria and fungi, and also respiratory support. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3(+) T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 might be influenced by immune system state and underlying diseases in cancer patients. And the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.",

Indeed, a variety of distinct cognitive mechanisms are engaged, in various combinations, in the diverse interactions called 'rituals' - and each of these mechanisms deserves study, in terms of its evolutionary underpinnings and cultural consequences. We identify four such mechanisms that each appear in some 'rituals', namely (i) the normative scripting of actions; (ii) the use of interactions to signal coalitional identity, affiliation, cohesiveness; (iii) magical claims based on intuitive expectations of contagion; and (iv) ritualized behaviour based on a specific handling of the flow of behaviour. We describe the cognitive and evolutionary background to each of these potential components of 'rituals', and their effects on cultural transmission.

METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model in which a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed advanced BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer was assigned to receive either olaparib maintenance therapy or active surveillance (Italian standard of care) after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy to compare cost-effectiveness and net monetary benefit of the 2 strategies. Data on clinical outcomes were obtained from related clinical trial literature and extrapolated using parametric survival analyses. Data on costs were derived from Italian official sources and relevant real-world studies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) were computed and compared against an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of euro16,372 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. We used deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) to assess how uncertainty affects results; we also performed scenario analyses to compare results under different pricing settings. FINDINGS: In the base-case scenario, during a 50-year time horizon, the total costs for patients treated with olaparib therapy and active surveillance were euro124,359 and euro97,043, respectively, and QALYs gained were 7.29 and 4.88, respectively, with an ICER of euro9,515 per life-year gained, an ICUR of euro11,345 per QALY gained, and an INMB of euro12,104. In scenario analyses, considering maximum selling prices for all other drugs, ICUR decreased to euro11,311 per QALY and euro7,498 per QALY when a 10% and 20% discount, respectively, was applied to the olaparib official price, and the INMB increased to euro12,186 and euro21,366, respectively. DSA found that the model results were most sensitive to the proportion of patients with relapsing disease in response to platinum-based chemotherapy, time receiving olaparib first-line maintenance treatment, and subsequent treatments price. According to PSAresults, olaparib was associated with a probability of being cost-effective at a euro16,372 per QALY WTP threshold ranging from 70% to 100% in the scenarios examined. IMPLICATIONS: Our analysis indicates that olaparib maintenance therapy may deliver a significant health benefit with a contained upfront cost during a 50-year time horizon, from the Italian NHS perspective, providing value in a setting with curative intent.",

We found that the foliar application of 30 mg L(-1) of GO could significantly reduce signs of Cd(2+) toxicity in lettuce. We observed increased net photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, transpiration rates, chlorophyll content, primary maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, actual quantum yield, photosynthetic electron transport rates, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase concentrations, and biomass in Cd(2+)-stressed lettuce treated with GO. In addition, the foliar application of 30 mg L(-1) of GO reduced the accumulation of the reactive oxygen species O.\u0304(2) and H(2)O(2), malondialdehyde content, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The decreased antioxidant enzyme activity could have been due to the decrease in reactive oxygen species.

However, it is unknown whether the assessment of the topographical distribution of Abeta pathology can provide additional information to identify, among global Abeta positive individuals, those destined for dementia. METHODS: We studied 260 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who were Abeta-PET positive with [(18)F]florbetapir. Using [(18)F]florbetapir, we assessed the percentage of voxels sowing Abeta abnormality as well as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values across brain regions. Regressions tested the predictive effect of Abeta on progression to dementia over 2 years. RESULTS: Neither global nor regional [(18)F]florbetapir SUVR concentrations predicted progression to dementia. In contrast, the spatial extent of Abeta pathology in regions comprising the default mode network was highly associated with the development of dementia over 2 years. DISCUSSION: These results highlight that the regional distribution of Abeta abnormality may provide important complementary information at an individual level regarding the likelihood of Abeta positive MCI to progress to dementia.",

A framework representing the determinants of healthy eating can be grouped into four categories i.e., the individual determinants, the economic environment, the social environment and the physical environment. This framework allowed for addressing food insecurity and social economic ecosystem of Canadians. Lastly, we investigate the role in which biotechnology plays in improving food security and addresses the significant impact biotechnology has contributed toward on agriculture and the food market. Overall, this review using such sources as Web of Science, Pub Med and Scopus provides significant contribution toward understanding the social economic environment and eating behavior of people living in Canada.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the injury rates of individuals engaged in CrossFit training and examine the risk of injury associated with competition. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. METHODS: Descriptive statistics, including injury incidence and rates, were examined for individuals reporting participation in a CrossFit sanctioned competition between 2013 and 2017. To examine the odds of being injured, we considered logistic regression models, where the primary independent measure was participation length-individual measures of interest included age, sex, body mass index, CrossFit affiliation and competition status. RESULTS: 3049 individuals completed the survey (60% completion rate). All competitors, regardless of competition level, had similar incidence of injury (chi(2)=1.1, p=0.571). For those who reported competing, our calculated injury rate was 0.21-0.54 injuries per 1000 training hours, while for those not competing, the injury rate was calculated as 0.39-1.30 injuries per 1000 training hours. Logistic regression demonstrated short length of participation in CrossFit training as the main factor associated with the odds of being injured (OR=1.82; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.92). Additionally, training at an official CrossFit affiliate appeared to have a protective effect from injury (OR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.10). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of the low risk of injury related to these events. Moreover, these findings support the notion that musculoskeletal injuries may be the result of poor progression plans, which may be minimised by participating in an official CrossFit affiliate.",

This process requires interactions between lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) on Tfh cells and ICAMs on B cells. The mechanisms underlying defective antibody responses to TD antigens in DOCK8 deficiency are incompletely understood. We show that mice selectively lacking DOCK8 in T cells had impaired IgG antibody responses to TD antigens, decreased GC size, and reduced numbers of GC B cells. However, they developed normal numbers of Tfh cells with intact capacity for driving B cell differentiation into a GC phenotype in vitro. Notably, migration of DOCK8-deficient T cells into GCs was defective. Following T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 ligation, DOCK8-deficient T cells had impaired LFA-1 activation and reduced binding to ICAM-1. Our results therefore indicate that DOCK8 is important for LFA-1-dependent positioning of Tfh cells in GCs, and thereby the generation of GC B cells and IgG antibody responses to TD antigen.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: While over 200 million opioid prescriptions are written annually for chronic pain in the USA, little has been written on the impact of opioids on bariatric surgery, specifically on the effects of prescription opioid use on weight loss post laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We completed a matched-cohort, retrospective review in 1176 consecutive patients undergoing primary bariatric surgery at a single institution. Patients were grouped into chronic prescription opioid users (POU), defined as ongoing opioid use for > 3 months at the time of surgery, and opioid-naive controls (CON), defined as no opioid use prior to surgery. About 130 POU and 130 CON patients were then matched according to preoperative comorbid conditions and demographics. RESULTS: Percent total weight loss was similar at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years in POU and CON-9.6 +/- 5.8 vs 8.9 +/- 4.5 (p = 0.057), 18.4 +/- 7.2 vs 18.5 +/- 7.2% (p = 0.901), 28.0 +/- 9.4 vs 27.9 +/- 12.9% (p = 0.894), 30.3 +/- 13.0 vs 32.8 +/- 9.0% (p = 0.387), and 31.4 +/- 12.7 vs 36.9 +/- 21.3% (p = 0.369), respectively. The 30-day readmission, reoperation, venothrombotic event rate, bleeding rate, and infection rate were similar in POU compared to CON patients. CONCLUSIONS: Complications and weight loss outcomes are similar for prescription opioid users compared to opioid-naive controls following bariatric surgery. Chronic prescription opioid use is not a contraindication to bariatric surgery.",

How they travel across grain boundaries (GBs) under external stress is crucial to understand the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials. Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate with single-particle resolution how the atomic structure of GBs affects the dynamics of interstitial defects driven across monolayer colloidal polycrystals. Owing to the complex inherent GB structure, we observe a rich dynamical behavior of defects near GBs. Below a critical driving force defects cannot cross GBs, resulting in their accumulation near these locations. Under certain conditions, defects are reflected at GBs, leading to their enrichment at specific regions within polycrystals. The channeling of defects within samples of specifically-designed GB structures opens up the possibility to design novel materials that are able to confine the spread of damage to certain regions.",

In addition to these, the carrier exhibited excellent gene binding capability and formed spherical shaped complexes. The carrier showed very high in vitro transfection efficiency in TNBC cell (MDA-MB-231) compared to lipofectamine 2000 (LF2k) which could be justified by its high buffering capacity.

Non-proliferative ROP (NP-ROP), also known as Early Stage ROP, is characterized by deficient retinal angiogenesis. Proliferative ROP (P-ROP), also known as Late Stage ROP, is characterized by pathologic angiogenesis. The use of neonatal haemoglobin A1C as a biomarker for ROP has not yet been evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We modified the Haemoglobin A1C assay for use with neonatal dried blood spots (DBS) and then assessed A1C levels via Elisa immunoassay on DBS from 43 preterm infants (with gestational ages 26-28 weeks). We measured A1C on DBS collected at <1 week and 4 weeks of chronological age. RESULTS: Compared to matched counterparts without ROP, there is significantly lower HbA1c in infants who develop NP-ROP, this occurs at Week 4 (p=0.004), but is not seen at Week 1; there is significantly higher HbA1c in infants with P-ROP, this occurs both at Week 1 (p<0.05) and Week 4 (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The A1C test, modified for use with DBS, is a feasible biomarker for ROP; low A1C is a potential biomarker for non-proliferative ROP and high A1C is for proliferative ROP.",

Suspended particles can cream or sediment depending on density differences between drug and propellant and shaking the pMDI is an essential step to ensure a uniform drug dose release. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of the delay (0, 10, 30, 60 seconds) in pMDI actuation after shaking and the effect of no-shaking during the canister life on the emitted dose (ED) for commercial solution and suspension pMDIs was investigated. RESULTS: The ED for solutions was unaffected by no-shaking or by the progressive increasing delay in actuation after shaking (between 77% and 97%). For all the suspension products, shaking was demonstrated to be critical to assure the close to nominal drug delivery. In detail, the actuation delay after shaking led to an increase up to 380% or a drop to 32% of ED in relation to the label claim with high variability. CONCLUSION: The drug delivered can vary widely for no-shaking and over different shake-fire delays with suspension pMDIs while solution formulations appear to remain stable.",

Herein, we modified a copper (Cu) foil current collector surface with an indium nitride (InN) thin film, which regulated the Li plating/stripping process through in situ lithiation. That is, InN transformed into a lithium nitride (Li(3)N)/Li-In alloy phase (Li(x)In(y))-mixed protection layer during the first Li plating process. Li(3)N is an efficient Li(+) conductor and is stable to Li, whereas Li(x)In(y) possesses fast Li(+) diffusion kinetics. The synergistic effect of these two species simultaneously caused the mixed protective layer to display fast Li(+) diffusion, inhibited the rapid growth of Li dendrites, and induced bottom Li deposition under the protective layer. Li parallelCu cells exhibited higher Coulombic efficiency and a more stable lithium plating/stripping process than a control cell without an InN layer. Moreover, when an InN thin film was transplanted onto the surface of a Li metal sheet using the same method, the resulting Li parallelLi symmetrical cell delivered extraordinary performance. This in situ formation of a multifunctional modified layer by a facile preparation process could be an effective way to inhibit dendrite growth and accelerate the application of LMBs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The improvement in the/reaction time is important, as it is an indicator of cognitive function. Therefore, there is a need, especially for adolescents in the form of techniques or courses that can improve the reaction time. Yoga was found to cause a better improvement in the health of the individuals. The present study intended to show the effects of Bhramari pranayama (Bhr.P) on reaction time in the healthy adolescents. METHODS: Of the 730 potential subjects screened, 520 apparently healthy adolescents randomly assigned to either the Bhr.P group (n-260) or control group (n-260). Bhr.P group practiced the bhramari pranayama for 3 days in a week for 6 months. The Auditory Reaction Time (ART) and the Visual Reaction Time (VRT) were assessed before and after Bhr.P pranayama practice. RESULTS: Bhr.P group shows significant shortening of response time in both VRT (from 267.13 +/- 52.65 to 249.87 +/- 39.41 ms) and ART (from 237.42 +/- 48.12 to 227.91 +/- 34.60 ms) after 6 months of Bhr.P practice. In control group subjects, no such significant changes were found (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Shortening of RT implies an improvement in the information processing and reflexes. This beneficial effect of Bhr.P on reaction time can be used for improving cognitive function in the adolescents for their academic performances.",

METHODS: A myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury rat model was established, and the rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: Control group, I/R model group, Gal 1 mg/kg group, Gal 2 mg/kg group and Gal 4 mg/kg group. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), and left ventricular short-axis shortening rate (FS) were detected by doppler ultrasound. Hematoxylin eosin staining was used to detect the pathological damage of myocardial tissue. The expression of Caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Protein expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), cleaved Caspase-12, growth arrest and DNA damageinducible protein 34 (GADD34), immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), Collagen \u2160, AMPKalpha1, Nrf2, and HO-1 were measured by western blot, and AMPK inhibitor Compound C was added for verification. RESULTS: Compared with the I/R model group, the grade of pathological damage of myocardial tissue in each group of Gal was improved, and cleaved Caspase-3 positive expression rate and Caspase-3 mRNA level were significantly reduced ( P<0.05) as well. The results showed that LVWT, FS and LVEF in Gal 2 mg/kg and Gal 4 mg/kg groups were significantly increased ( P<0.05), LVEDV and LVESV were significantly reduced ( P<0.05) compared with I/R model group. CHOP, cleaved Caspase-12, alpha-SMA, Collagen \u2160, AMPKalpha1, Nrf2, HO-1 protein levels were significantly reduced ( P<0.05), and GADD34 and BiP protein levels were significantly increased ( P<0.05) in Gal 2 mg/kg and Gal 4 mg/kg groups.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preservation rhinoplasty (PR) is revolutionizing rhinoplasty surgery, based on new anatomical studies, advanced tip suture techniques, and refinement of surgical techniques. Septal surgery is a fundamental preparatory stage during PR, especially for the dorsal preservation let/push-down procedure. To increase the predictability of the septoplasty aesthetic effects on the nasal dorsum and further extend the principles of PR to septal surgery, we applied the endoscopic technology to the \"quick\" septoplasty technique we had already developed in the past decades. METHODS: One hundred sixty-six patients (41 males, 125 females; mean age, 39.7 years; age range, 18-61 years) were submitted to endoscopic \"quick\" septoplasty for septal deviation during PR procedure. Preoperative evaluation of the nasal dorsum included external examinations of the size, shape, and orientation of the dorsum. Anterior active rhinomanometry was performed in all patients to determine nasal flow resistance preoperatively and 6 months after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative patients' scores on the Nasal Obstruction Septoplasty Effectiveness questionnaire were compared to assess the improvement of nasal symptoms after surgery. The duration of the septoplasty procedure was measured for all the patients. Standard nasal photographic assessment was performed before and 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Postoperatively, 98.8% of our patients displayed an improvement of their nasal breathing function. No complication in terms of septal perforation, nasal infection, or bleeding was noticed. No case of turbinoseptal synechiae or cerebrospinal fluid leak was recorded. The dorsum preservation rhinoplasty procedure was successfully completed in all patients. The mean septoplasty operative time, excluding local anesthesia injection and other surgical procedures associated with septal surgery such as turbinoplasty and rhinoplasty, was 11.41 +/- 6.23 minutes (range, 9-31 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that a short surgical time is needed to perform the proposed endoscopic septoplasty procedure. Such a short operative time allows the physician to both correct septal deviations quickly and correct/reduce the cartilaginous hump, thus representing a fundamental element of PR. In addition, the minimal tissue dissection reduces intraoperative nasal edema, favoring intraoperative aesthetic evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Human speech production requires the ability to couple motor actions with their auditory consequences. Nonhuman primates might not have speech because they lack this ability. To address this question, we trained macaques to perform an auditory-motor task producing sound sequences via hand presses on a newly designed device (\"monkey piano\"). Catch trials were interspersed to ascertain the monkeys were listening to the sounds they produced. Functional MRI was then used to map brain activity while the animals listened attentively to the sound sequences they had learned to produce and to two control sequences, which were either completely unfamiliar or familiar through passive exposure only. All sounds activated auditory midbrain and cortex, but listening to the sequences that were learned by self-production additionally activated the putamen and the hand and arm regions of motor cortex. These results indicate that, in principle, monkeys are capable of forming internal models linking sound perception and production in motor regions of the brain, so this ability is not special to speech in humans. However, the coupling of sounds and actions in nonhuman primates (and the availability of an internal model supporting it) seems not to extend to the upper vocal tract, that is, the supralaryngeal articulators, which are key for the production of speech sounds in humans. The origin of speech may have required the evolution of a \"command apparatus\" similar to the control of the hand, which was crucial for the evolution of tool use.",

        "abstract": "Social cognition is dependent on the ability to extract information from human stimuli. Of those, patterns of biological motion (BM) and in particular walking patterns of other humans, are prime examples. Although most often tested in isolation, BM outside the laboratory is often associated with multisensory cues (i.e. we often hear and see someone walking) and there is evidence that vision-based judgments of BM stimuli are systematically influenced by motor signals. Furthermore, cross-modal visuo-tactile mechanisms have been shown to influence perception of bodily stimuli. Based on these observations, we here investigated if somatosensory inputs would affect visual BM perception. In two experiments, we asked healthy participants to perform a speed discrimination task on two point light walkers (PLW) presented one after the other. In the first experiment, we quantified somatosensory-visual interactions by presenting PLW together with tactile stimuli either on the participants' forearms or feet soles. In the second experiment, we assessed the specificity of these interactions by presenting tactile stimuli either synchronously or asynchronously with upright or inverted PLW. Our results confirm that somatosensory input in the form of tactile foot stimulation influences visual BM perception. When presented with a seen walker's footsteps, additional tactile cues enhanced sensitivity on a speed discrimination task, but only if the tactile stimuli were presented on the relevant body-part (under the feet) and when the tactile stimuli were presented synchronously with the seen footsteps of the PLW, whether upright or inverted. Based on these findings we discuss potential mechanisms of somatosensory-visual interactions in BM perception.",

However, whether Dex could alleviate smoke-induced lung injury remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the protective effects of Dex against smoke-induced lung injury. Bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells were treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 24 h to simulate cigarette smoke-induced lung injury. Results showed that CSE reduced cell viability and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, thus activating NF-kappaB and COX2 expression. CSE also increased ROS generation, whereas lessened MnSOD and catalase generation. Besides, the ratio of apoptotic cells was enhanced upon CSE stimuli, together with disturbance of apoptotic-related proteins including Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3. However, Dex reduced the damage of CSE to cell viability. The increased activities of TNFalpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 induced by CSE were partially attenuated by Dex. Dex also recovered the levels of NF-kappaB and COX2, as well as mnSOD, catalase and ROS. Furthermore, the increase of cell apoptosis together with imbalance of apoptotic proteins induced by CSE was rescued by Dex. Our results demonstrated that Dex alleviated CSE-induced lung injury through inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Organophosphorus pesticides exert their toxic effects mainly by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is related to emotional disorders, such as depression. Atropine-oximes therapy is commonly used; however, the efficacy of oximes in the reactivation of AChE has been inconsistent. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of (3Z)-5-Chloro-3-(hydroxyimino)indolin-2-one (Cl-HIN), a compound that combines the isatin and oxime functional groups, in rats exposed to malathion. The effect of Cl-HIN on the AChE activity and the BDNF-Trkbeta pathway in the prefrontal cortex of malathion-exposed rats were tested. METHODS: Wistar male rats were co-treated with Cl-HIN [50 mg/kg (p.o.) (3 mL/kg)] and/or malathion [250 mg/kg (i.p.) (5 mL/kg)] and performed behavioral tests twelve hours after these exposures. RESULTS: The Cl-HIN reversed the increased immobility time in the forced swimming test and the decreased grooming time in the splash test induced by malathion, but any significant difference was observed in locomotion analysis. These results demonstrate the antidepressant-like effect of Cl-HIN. The cortical AChE activity was reactivated by Cl-HIN in rats exposed to malathion. Malathion induced an increase in Trkbeta and a decrease in BDNF levels in the prefrontal cortex of rats, which were avoided by Cl-HIN. CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that Cl-HIN is an AChE reactivator with antidepressant-like properties, which is related to the improvement of BDNF-Trkbeta signaling after acute exposure to malathion in rats. Thus, the results allow suggesting the potential use of Cl-HIN as an oxime-based therapy against the neurotoxic effects of malathion.",

They are a heterogeneous population that cannot be defined only by age but should rather be stratified based on their frailty. The elderly have distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, are frequently polymorbid, and are therefore treated with multiple drugs. They may experience adverse reactions that are difficult to recognize, since some of them present non-specific symptoms easily mistaken for geriatric conditions. Paradoxically, the elderly are underrepresented in clinical trials, especially the frail individuals whose pharmacological response and expected treatment outcome can be different from those of non-frail patients. This means that the benefit-risk balance of drugs used in frail elderly patients is frequently unknown. We present some proposals to overcome the barriers preventing the enrollment of frail elderly patients in clinical trials, and strategies for monitoring their therapy to minimize the risk of adverse reactions. Automated alerts for drug and drug-disease interactions could help appropriate prescribing but should flag only clinically relevant interactions. Pharmaceutical forms should be designed to allow easy dose adjustment and, together with packaging and labeling, should account for the physical and cognitive limitations of frail elderly patients. Aggregate pharmacovigilance reports should summarize the safety profile in the elderly, but rather than presenting the results by age they should focus on patients' frailty, perhaps using the number of comorbidities as a proxy when information on frailty is not available.",

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study from 1990 to 1993 in Santiago de Chile, Chile among women aged 40-59 (at baseline). Diagnosed illnesses were retrieved from national health records in 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and laboratory evaluation was conducted. RESULTS: 1066 women were followed-up for a mean of 27.8 years, after which 49.7% presented multimorbidity. These women, as compared with those without multimorbidity, were more likely at baseline to have had obesity (20.4% vs. 8.6%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001); be post-menopause (47.2% vs. 40.5%; p\u202f<\u202f0.03); have jobs that did not require a qualification (74.2% vs. 56.0%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001); arterial hypertension (19.8% vs 14.4%, p\u202f<\u202f0.018); lower HDL-cholesterol (51.3 +/- 12.9 vs. 53.6+/-12.7 mg/dL, p\u202f<\u202f0.005); and higher triglyceride levels (136.0 +/- 65.0 vs. 127.0 +/- 74.0 mg/dL, p\u202f=\u202f0.028). Hypertension was associated in 22.0% of women with diabetes, in 20.9% with osteoarthritis and 14.0% with depression. Osteoarthritis was also associated with diabetes mellitus (8.3%) and depression (7.8%). Diabetes mellitus, in addition to hypertension and osteoarthritis, was associated with depression (6.4%). In a logistic regression model, we observed that obesity in middle-aged women was the strongest risk factor for multimorbidity in the elderly (OR: 2.48; 95% CI, 1.71-3.61), followed by having a job that did not require a qualification (OR: 2.18; 95% CI, 1.67-2.83) and having a low HDL-cholesterol level (OR: 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.68). CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity was highly prevalent in this older female population. Obesity in middle-aged women was the strongest risk factor for multimorbidity at older age. These results are relevant for Chile and other countries with similar population profiles.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: There are limited data regarding postoperative complications and autoimmune reactions caused by surgery in early-stage cervical cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic radical resection (LRR). This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of LRR of cervical cancer patients and its effect on cytokines. METHODS: 168 patients with cervical cancer were enrolled. The patients were divided into open group and laparoscopic group according to the random number table method, with 84 cases in each group. The surgical-related indexes and the incidence of complications of the two groups were observed, and the IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-1/2/4/6/8/10/12 levels in peripheral blood were compared before and after surgery in both groups. RESULTS: The operation time of the patients in the laparoscopic group was significantly shorter than that in the open group (119.56 +/- 45.26 vs. 206.36 +/- 54.39, P < 0.01). The intraoperative blood loss in the laparoscopic group was significantly less than that in the open group (155.29 +/- 57.58 vs. 529.58 +/- 162.4, P < 0.01). The postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) score was also significantly lower than that in the open group (3.65 +/- 0.88 vs. 6.32 +/- 1.12, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups. The degree of inflammatory cytokines changes caused by LRR was less than that of open radical surgery (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LRR surgery has less stress on patients with early cervical cancer than open surgery within 5 days after surgery, which has certain reference value for early cervical cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "An ultra-performance liquid chromatography(UPLC) method integrating characteristic chromatogram and eight terpenoids determination has been established for comparing the differences of Alismatis Rhizoma(Zexie) from different product areas. Thirty-seven batches of crude drugs and thirty batches of prepared slices of Alismatis Rhizoma were analyzed. The obtained data were analyzed by similarity evaluation, principal components analysis(PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis(PLS-DA). There were three main characteristic peaks in the characteristic chromatograms, and alisol B 23-acetate(S) was selected as the reference. Compared with the S peak, the relative retention times of the other two characteristic peaks were 0.55(alisol) and 0.77(alisol B), respectively. Peak areas and the ratio of alisol B to alisol B 23-acetate could be used to distinguish Alismatis Rhizoma from different geographical origins. The samples were divided into three groups by PCA and PLS-DA based on the content determination results, and they were \"Jian Zexie\"(Fujian and Jiangxi provinces), \"Chuan Zexie\"(Sichuan and Hubei provinces), and \"Guang Zexie\"(Guangxi province). The contents of chemical components in samples from different producing areas were notably different. For example, the contents of alisol A and alisol A 24-acetate were significantly higher in \"Guang Zexie\" compared with \"Jian Zexie\" and \"Chuan Zexie\"(P<0.000 1). The contents of alisol B and alisol C were significantly higher in \"Chuan Zexie\" compared with \"Jian Zexie\"(P<0.000 1). Combining the characteristic chromatograms and quantitative analysis of eight terpenoids, this study showed that the relative contents of components and their ratios were notable different in samples from different regions, but types and numbers of chemical compositions were basically similar. The results of this study illustrated the regional differences of Alismatis Rhizoma and their components characteristics, and provided references for authentication and quality control of Alismatis Rhizoma.",

Diagnosis of dermatophytosis is easy, however, poses diagnostic challenge in partial treatment, steroid abuse. Dermoscopy is noninvasive tool for diagnosis of many infestations and infections. Dermoscopy in dermatophytosis is not well documented. We evaluated dermatoscopic patterns to correlate with histopathological changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study was conducted in tertiary hospital after obtaining ethical clearance and informed consent. DermLite 3 dermoscope was used to examine the lesions. Polarized and nonpolarized modes were used and ultrasound gel was utilized. Potassium hydroxide mount and skin biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis. RESULTS: About 30 patients with 16 males and 14 females were present. Median duration was 3.5 months and median age was 30 years. The most common site was waist and crural area affecting 20 (66.66%). Dermoscopy revealed brown to black dots, globules, and white scales in all patients (100.0%). Lesions of shorter duration (26.66%) demonstrated red dots, dotted vessels, reddish-brown dots, and globules, and brown to black dots and globules were noted in lesions of longer duration (73.33%). Hair changes were noted in five (16.66%) patients. CONCLUSION: Dermoscopy showed particular patterns in dermatophytosis. Patterns were consistent irrespective of age, sex, and site of involvement. Presence of reddish-brown and black globules with white scales was found to be the most characteristic dermoscopic feature.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The potential benefits of mobile health (mHealth) initiatives to manage the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been explored. The Government of India, State governments, and healthcare organizations have developed various mobile apps for the containment of COVID-19. This study was aimed to systematically review COVID-19 related mobile apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives. METHODS: Google Play and the Apple app stores were searched using the terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', and 'epidemic' in the first week of April 2020. A list of COVID-19-specific functions was compiled based on the review of the selected apps, the literature on epidemic surveillance, and national and international media reports. The World Health Organization guideline on Digital Health Interventions was used to classify the app functions under the categories of the general public, health workers, health system managers, and data services. RESULTS: The search yielded 346 potential COVID-19 apps, of which 50 met the inclusion criteria. Dissemination of untargeted COVID-19-related information on preventative strategies and monitoring the movements of quarantined individuals was the function of 27 (54%) and 19 (32%) apps, respectively. Eight (16%) apps had a contact tracing and hotspot identification function. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the current emphasis on the development of self-testing, quarantine monitoring, and contact tracing apps. India's response to COVID-19 can be strengthened by developing comprehensive mHealth solutions for frontline healthcare workers, rapid response teams and public health authorities. Among this unprecedented global health emergency, the Governments must ensure the necessary but least intrusive measures for disease surveillance.",

At a synchronized estrus, follicular dynamics were determined using transrectal ultrasonography. Plasma estradiol concentrations were also monitored. In total 27 ewes were observed in estrus being 9/11 LP (82%) and 18/20 HP (90%). On the day of estrus (day 0), the mean number of large follicles was higher (p < .05) in HP (1.78 +/- 0.19) than in LP (1.0 +/- 0.28) ewes. Prior to estrus, more (p < .05) medium follicles were visible for HP compared to LP ewes. Plasma estradiol concentrations were higher in HP compared to LP ewes (18.91 +/- 0.41 vs. 14.51 +/- 0.65 pg/ml; p < .05) and similarly was ovulation number (2.3 +/- 0.15 vs. 1.28 +/- 0. 14; p < .05). Higher ovulation rates and litter size in Bonga sheep are evidenced by the previous presence of more large follicles and the existence of co-dominance effects as most likely medium follicles are selected to ovulate.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Up to 50% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) show no disease-causing variants in genetic studies. TRIM63 has been suggested as a candidate gene for the development of cardiomyopathies, although evidence for a causative role in HCM is limited. We sought to investigate the relationship between rare variants in TRIM63 and the development of HCM. METHODS: TRIM63 was sequenced by next generation sequencing in 4867 index cases with a clinical diagnosis of HCM and in 3628 probands with other cardiomyopathies. Additionally, 3136 index cases with familial cardiovascular diseases other than cardiomyopathy (mainly channelopathies and aortic diseases) were used as controls. RESULTS: Sixteen index cases with rare homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in TRIM63 (15 HCM and one restrictive cardiomyopathy) were included. No homozygous or compound heterozygous were identified in the control population. Familial evaluation showed that only homozygous and compound heterozygous had signs of disease, whereas all heterozygous family members were healthy. The mean age at diagnosis was 35 years (range 15-69). Fifty per cent of patients had concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and 45% were asymptomatic at the moment of the first examination. Significant degrees of late gadolinium enhancement were detected in 80% of affected individuals, and 20% of patients had left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Fifty per cent had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Twenty per cent of patients suffered an adverse cerebrovascular event (20%). CONCLUSION: TRIM63 appears to be an uncommon cause of HCM inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner and associated with concentric LVH and a high rate of LV dysfunction.",

The application of ABGS included cervical cage for use in the anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), while for the posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) sheep model allograft devitalized bone particles (ALLO) were applied with and without use of instrumentation. In the ALIF model, ABGS (rhBMP6/ABC/cage) implants fused significantly when placed in between the L4-L5 vertebrae as compared to control (ABC/cage) which appears to have a fibrocartilaginous gap, as examined by histology and micro CT analysis at 16 weeks following surgery. In the PLF model, ABGS implants with or without ALLO showed a complete fusion when placed ectopically in the gutter bilaterally between two decorticated L4-L5 transverse processes at a success rate of 88% without instrumentation and at 80% with instrumentation; however the bone volume was 50% lower in the instrumentation group than without, as examined by histology, radiographs, micro CT analyses and biomechanical testing at 27 weeks following surgery. The newly formed bone was uniform within ABGS implants resulting in a biomechanically competent and histologically qualified fusion with an optimum dose in the range of 100 mug rhBMP6 per mL ABC, while in the implants that contained ALLO, the mineralized bone particles were substituted by the newly formed remodeling bone via creeping substitution. These findings demonstrate for the first time that ABGS (rhBMP6/ABC) without and with ALLO particles induced a robust bone formation with a successful fusion in sheep models of ALIF and PLF, and that autologous blood coagulum (ABC) can serve as a preferred physiological native carrier to induce new bone at low doses of rhBMP6 and to achieve a successful spinal fusion.",

Incorporating patient values during COS development increases the patient centeredness of evidence available across decision-making contexts. However, the approach to meaningful patient engagement in the COS process is evolving and poses both unique challenges and opportunities. We describe an approach to patient-centered COS development and discuss challenges and adaptations to improve engagement across COS projects. We provide examples from our experience in patient engagement for COS development using three completed COS projects. This approach includes patient engagement in terms of partnering with patient organizations, orientation and training, and the consensus process. Including COS in clinical development programs and HEOR will ensure that relevant, consistent outcomes are available for healthcare decision making and should result in faster access to high-value and novel therapies for patients. Patient-centered COS development increases the likelihood that further HEOR studies and decisions made using the COS are relevant to patients.",

Numerous factors affecting concussion reporting have been explored; however, the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in reporting has not been established. We examined the influence of SES and academic achievement (high-school grade point average [HS-GPA] and American College Testing [ACT] composite scores) on athletes' concussion-reporting intentions and behaviors. A cross-sectional study was employed among 191 athletes (94 female; age 19.3 +/- 1.2 years). Athletes reported SES metrics (parental education and occupation, household income, HS-GPA, and ACT composite score) prior to their athletic season and completed a survey assessing symptom- and concussion-reporting intentions. Symptom- and concussion-reporting behaviors were assessed among athletes who experienced a concussion within the past year. SES was determined using the Hollingshead Four-Factor Index grouping athletes into SES strata. Athletes were grouped into low/high categories for academic achievement and household income variables. The 191 athletes were included for symptom- and concussion-reporting intentions analyses, while 46 and 41 were included for symptom- and concussion-reporting behavior, respectively. Nonparametric statistics with false discovery rate adjusted p values were employed. We found symptom- and concussion-reporting intentions, and symptom- and concussion-reporting behaviors were not significantly different based on SES strata (all p values >/=.64), household income (all p values >/=.64), HS-GPA (all p values >/=.24), or ACT scores (all p values >/=.25). Overall, SES and academic achievement may not play a role in understanding concussion reporting among middle- to high-SES collegiate athletes. Implementing policies targeting certain SES and academic levels might be an ineffective health care strategy for increasing reporting.",

Generation of the oxygen-deficient vanadium oxide, [V(6)O(6)(OC(2)H(5))(12)](1-), was confirmed via independent synthesis. Spectroscopic analysis using infrared and electronic absorption spectroscopies affords resolution of the electronic structure of the oxygen-deficient cluster (oxidation state distribution = [V(III)V(IV)(5)]). This work has direct implications toward the elucidation of possible mechanisms of acid-assisted vacancy formation in bulk transition metal oxides, in particular electron-proton codoping that has recently been described for vanadium oxide (VO(2)). Ultimately, these molecular models deepen our understanding of proton-dependent redox chemistry of transition metal oxide surfaces.",

In this work, antiferroelectric Pb(0.88)Ca(0.12)ZrO(3) (PCZ) thin films were prepared via chemical solution deposition and annealed using rapid thermal annealing. The microstructures of PCZ thin films were controlled via annealing temperature, and the effects of microstructures on electric properties and energy storage performance were systematically studied. Our results indicate that PCZ thin films annealed at 550  degrees C crystallized into a nanocrystalline structure of the pyrochlore phase, while also displaying the highest recoverable energy density and efficiency (91.3 J/cm(3) and 85.3%). We attribute the ultrahigh energy storage properties mainly to dramatic improvements in the electric breakdown strength caused by the dense nanocrystalline structure. The findings reported herein help to elucidate the relationship between energy storage performance and thin-film microstructure, thereby providing an effective way for improving the energy storage performance of antiferroelectric thin films.",

Studies of the association between concurrent objective measures of sleep, physical activity, and metabolic risk factors among adolescents are limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the association between metabolic risk factors and objectively measured school day physical activity and sleep duration, quality, onset, and variability in adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured one school week of free-living sleep and physical activity with wrist actigraphy in 252 adolescents (146 girls), aged 15.8+/-0.3 years. Metabolic risk factors included body mass index, waist circumference, total body and trunk fat percentage, resting blood pressure, and fasting glucose and insulin levels. Multiple linear regression adjusted for sex, parental education, and day length was used to assess associations between metabolic risk factors and sleep and activity parameters. RESULTS: On average, participants went to bed at 00:22+/-0.88 hours and slept 6.2+/-0.7 hours/night, with 0.83+/-0.36 hours of awakenings/night. However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration was considerable (mean +/- interquartile range) 0.75+/-0.55 hours) and bedtime (0.64+/-0.53 hours) respectively. Neither average sleep duration nor mean bedtime was associated with any metabolic risk factors. However, greater night-to-night variability in sleep duration and bedtime was associated with higher total body and trunk fat percentage, and less physical activity was associated with higher trunk fat percentage and insulin levels. CONCLUSION: Greater nightly variation in sleep duration and in bedtime and less physical activity were associated with a less favorable metabolic profile in adolescents. These findings support the idea that, along with an adequate amount of physical activity, a regular sleep schedule is important for the metabolic health of adolescents.",

Methods In this phase 1b study, patients with N/KRAS WT, MET-positive mCRC who had progressed following anti-EGFR mAb treatment received escalating oral doses of capmatinib (150, 300, and 400 mg) twice daily plus weekly intravenous cetuximab (at the approved dose). The primary objective was to establish a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of capmatinib in combination with cetuximab. Safety, preliminary activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics were also explored. Results Thirteen patients were enrolled. No patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity at investigated doses; the RDE was established as capmatinib 400 mg twice daily plus cetuximab. All patients experienced adverse events (AEs) suspected to be related to the study treatment. Five patients (38.5%) reported study-drug-related AEs of grade 3/4 in severity. No patients achieved a complete or partial response according to RECIST v1.1; however, tumor shrinkage of 29-44% was observed in 4 patients. Conclusions Capmatinib plus cetuximab was well tolerated. Preliminary signs of activity were observed. Further investigation is warranted to obtain efficacy data and refine predictive biomarkers of response. Clinical trial registration NCT02205398.",

In this review, the most recent advances in UASB reactor applications are critically summarized and discussed, with outline on the most critical aspects for further possible future developments. Beside traditional anaerobic treatment of soluble and biodegradable substrates, research is actually focusing on the treatment of refractory and slowly degradable matrices, thanks to an improved understanding of microbial community composition and reactor hydrodynamics, together with utilization of powerful modeling tools. Innovative approaches include the use of UASB reactor for nitrogen removal, as well as for hydrogen and volatile fatty acid production. Co-digestion of complementary substrates available in the same territory is being extensively studied to increase biogas yield and provide smooth continuous operations in a circular economy perspective. Particular importance is being given to decentralized treatment, able to provide electricity and heat to local users with possible integration with other renewable energies. Proper pre-treatment application increases biogas yield, while a successive post-treatment is needed to meet required effluent standards, also from a toxicological perspective. An increased full-scale application of UASB technology is desirable to achieve circular economy and sustainability scopes, with efficient biogas exploitation, fulfilling renewable energy targets and green-house gases emission reduction, in particular in tropical countries, where limited reactor heating is required.",

Projections of annual precipitation show a general decrease in almost the whole region except over the central area where positive changes are detected due to a significant increase in winter. For consecutive wet days, an annual decrease is also projected over the country attributable to a significant decrease mainly observed in spring and to a lesser extent in winter. On the other hand, consecutive dry days are projected to be higher overall as a result of significant increases in spring, summer and autumn. Positive changes are also projected for the maximum daily precipitation during winter and autumn.",

        "abstract": "As a result of increasing melanoma incidence and challenges with clinical and histopathologic evaluation of pigmented lesions, noninvasive techniques to assist in the assessment of skin lesions are highly sought after. This review discusses the methods, benefits, and limitations of adhesive patch biopsy, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), multispectral imaging, high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) in the detection of skin cancer. Adhesive patch biopsy provides improved sensitivity and specificity for the detection of melanoma without a trade-off of higher sensitivity for lower specificity seen in other diagnostic tools to aid in skin cancer detection, including EIS and multispectral imaging. EIS and multispectral imaging provide objective information based on computer-assisted diagnosis to assist in the decision to biopsy and/or excise an atypical melanocytic lesion. HFUS may be useful for the determination of skin tumor depth and identification of surgical borders, although further studies are necessary to determine its accuracy in the detection of skin cancer. OCT and RCM provide enhanced resolution of skin tissue and have been applied for improved accuracy in skin cancer diagnosis, as well as monitoring the response of nonsurgical treatments of skin cancers and the determination of tumor margins and recurrences. These novel approaches to skin cancer assessment offer opportunities to dermatologists, but are dependent on the individual dermatologist's comfort, knowledge, and desire to invest in training and implementation of noninvasive techniques. These noninvasive modalities may have a role in the complementary assessment of skin cancers, although histopathologic diagnosis remains the gold standard for the evaluation of skin cancer.",

Epigenetics has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of human biology, impacting virtually all areas of cellular physiology. Inhibition of an epigenetic enzyme is a potential treatment of cSCC. AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview of the development of inhibitors targeting the lysine demethylase, LSD1 (KDM1A), the first histone demethylase discovered. We summarize current treatment modalities for cSCC and provide a rationale for why epigenome-targeting therapies, and particularly LSD1 inhibitors, may be a novel and effective approach for treating pre-malignant and malignant cSCCs. A search was conducted in PubMed utilizing the combination of 'LSD1' with keywords such as 'epidermis,' 'squamous cell carcinoma,' or 'skin.' Relevant papers from 2000 to 2020 were reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Given the ability of LSD1 inhibitors to promote epidermal differentiation and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, LSD1 inhibitors may offer a highly effective therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of these ubiquitous cancers.",

Aerobic exercise training (AT) improves endothelial function. However, the effects of resistance training (RT) and combined training (CT) on endothelial function remain controversial in individuals with SAH. We determined the effects of AT, RT, and CT on endothelial function and systolic (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension. Forty-two participants (54 +/- 11 y, resting SBP/DBP 137 +/- 9/86 +/- 6 mmHg) were randomly allocated into AT (n = 14, 40 min of cycling, 50-75% heart rate reserve), RT (n = 14, 6 resistance exercises, 4 x 12 repetitions, 60% maximum strength) and CT (n = 14, 2 x 12 repetitions of RT + 20 min of AT). All participants performed a 40-minute exercise session twice a week for 8 weeks. Endothelial function was evaluated by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Blood pressure was evaluated through ambulatory monitoring for 24 hours. After 8 weeks of exercise training, blood pressure was reduced in all 3 groups: -5.1 mmHg in SBP (95%CI -10.1, 0.0; p = 0.003) in AT; -4.0 mmHg in SBP (95%CI -7.8, -0.5; p = 0.027) in RT; and -3.2 mmHg in DBP (95%CI -7.9, 1.5; p = 0.001) in CT. All 3 exercise training modalities produced similar improvements in FMD: + 3.2% (95%CI 1.7, 4.6) (p < 0.001) in AT; + 4.0% (95%CI 2.1, 5.7) (p < 0.001) in RT; and +6.8% (95%CI 2.6, 11.1) (p = 0.006) in CT. In conclusion, different exercise training modalities were similarly effective in improving endothelial function but impacts on ambulatory blood pressure appear to be variable in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension.",

Large-scale genome-wide association studies have identified few SNPs associated with LV mass. We hypothesized that a polygenic discovery approach using LV mass measurements made in a clinical population would identify risk factors and diseases associated with adverse LV remodeling. We developed a polygenic single nucleotide polymorphism-based predictor of LV mass in 7,601 individuals with LV mass measurements made during routine clinical care. We tested for associations between this predictor and 894 clinical diagnoses measured in 58,838 unrelated genotyped individuals. There were 29 clinical phenotypes associated with the LV mass genetic predictor at FDR q < 0.05. Genetically predicted higher LV mass was associated with modifiable cardiac risk factors, diagnoses related to organ dysfunction and conditions associated with abnormal cardiac structure including heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Secondary analyses using polygenic predictors confirmed a significant association between higher LV mass and body mass index and, in men, associations with coronary atherosclerosis and systolic blood pressure. In summary, these analyses show that LV mass-associated genetic variability associates with diagnoses of cardiac diseases and with modifiable risk factors which contribute to these diseases.",

        "abstract": "The design and development of robust and porous supported catalysts with high activity and selectivity is extremely significant but very challenging for eco-friendly synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. We report here the design and synthesis of highly stable chiral Zr(IV)-based MOFs with different topologies to support Ir complexes and demonstrate their network structures-dependent asymmetric catalytic performance. Guided by the modulated synthesis and isoreticular expansion strategy, five chiral Zr-MOFs with a flu or ith topology are constructed from enantiopure 1,1'-biphenol-derived tetracarboxylate linkers and Zr(6), Zr(9), or Zr(12) clusters. The obtained MOFs all show high chemical stability in boiling water, strongly acidic, and weakly basic aqueous solutions. The two flu MOFs featuring the dihydroxyl groups of biphenol in open and large cages, after sequential postsynthetic modification with P(NMe(2))(3) and [Ir(COD)Cl](2), can be highly efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation of alpha-dehydroamino acid esters with up to 98% ee, whereas the three ith MOFs featuring the dihydroxyl groups in small cages cannot be installed with P(NMe(2))(3) to support the Ir complex. Incorporation of Ir-phosphorus catalysts into Zr-MOFs leads to great enhancement of their chemical stability, durability, and even stereoselectivity. This work therefore not only advances Zr-MOFs as stable supports for labile metal catalysts for heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis but also provides a new insight into how highly active chiral centers can result due to the framework topology.",

The classic example is a carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene (C(*+)PF(*-)) radical pair that has been shown to provide a \"proof-of-principle\" for the operation of a chemical compass [K. Maeda et al., Nature 453, 387 (2008)]. Previous simulations of this radical pair have employed semiclassical approximations, which are routinely applicable to its 47 coupled electronic and nuclear spins. However, calculating the exact quantum mechanical spin dynamics presents a significant challenge and has not been possible until now. Here, we use a recently developed method to perform numerically converged simulations of the C(*+)PF(*-) quantum mechanical spin dynamics, including all coupled spins. A comparison of these quantum mechanical simulations with various semiclassical approximations reveals that, while it is not perfect, the best semiclassical approximation does capture essentially all of the relevant physics in this problem.",

This study presents a subanalysis of real-world 1-year follow-up data from the ESC-EHRA EORP Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Ablation Long-Term registry to analyze the usage of adenosine during PVI treatment in terms of rhythm outcome and safety. METHODS: The registry consists of 104 participating centers in 27 countries within the European Society of Cardiology. The registry data was split into an adenosine group (AG) and no-adenosine group (NAG). Procedure characteristics and patient outcome were compared. RESULTS: Adenosine was administered in 10.8% of the 3591 PVI patients included in the registry. Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy included the majority of adenosine cases (48.8%). Adenosine was applied more often in combination with open irrigation radiofrequency (RF) energy (74.7%) and less often in combination with nonirrigated RF energy (1.6%). After 1 year, a higher percentage of the AG was free from AF compared with the NAG (68.9% vs 59.1%, p < 0.001). Adenosine was associated with better rhythm outcome in RF ablation procedures, but not in cryo-ablation procedures (freedom from AF: RF: AG: 70.9%, NAG: 58.1%, p < 0.001, cryo: AG: 63.9%, NAG: 63.8%, p = 0.991). CONCLUSIONS: The use of adenosine was associated with a better rhythm outcome after 1 year follow-up and seems more useful in patients treated with RF energy compared with patients treated with cryo energy. Given the improved rhythm outcome at 1-year follow-up, it seems reasonable to encourage the use of adenosine during RF AF ablation.",

Relatively little is known about the risk factors for the development of problematic ecstasy use. Such information would be valuable for targeted intervention, prevention, and education AIMS: The current study aimed to fill this gap by investigating several hypothesised risk factors for problematic use and the relationships between them. METHODS: Self-reported impulsivity, psychological distress, sex, and coping motives for ecstasy use were investigated as predictors of problematic ecstasy use in a cross-sectional online survey. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 483 individuals (60.5% male, 38.3% female, 1.2% other) aged 18-62\u202fyears, reporting ecstasy use on an average of 59.7 occasions (SD\u202f=\u202f167.8). Both higher self-reported impulsivity and psychological distress predicted problem ecstasy use, and both these relationships were partially mediated by coping motives. When these variables were examined in a combined mediation model accounting for their covariance, psychological distress still predicted problematic use partially via an effect on coping motives, while impulsivity showed only a direct effect on problem use. No sex differences in problem ecstasy use were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Increased trait impulsivity and psychological distress appear to confer greater risk of problematic ecstasy use. Targeting these factors, as well as coping motives for ecstasy use, may be useful in efforts to prevent and reduce problematic ecstasy use among those who use the drug.",

In this study, the effects of melatonin on the interaction between CaN and NFAT signaling during oxidative stress-induced cell death were investigated. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the non-radical reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Cells were treated with 200 muM H(2)O(2) for the indicated time. Some H(2)O(2)-treated cells were pretreated with melatonin for 1 h. Control cells were treated with the same concentration of ethanol used to dilute melatonin. H(2)O(2)-induced cell death promoted increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the nuclear translocation of NFAT, which were related to increased levels the active, cleaved form of CaN (32.5 kDa). In addition, pretreatment of H(2)O(2)-treated cells with melatonin decreased cell death, ROS production, the levels of the active-cleaved form of CaN and the nuclear translocation of NFAT. Based on these findings, melatonin may exert its neuroprotective effects on oxidative damage-induced cell death by inhibiting CaN-activated the nuclear translocation of NFAT.",

Sampling for species collection was carried out from April 2017 to September 2018 at different distances from the forest center, i.e., (0-500 m), forest mid-interior (501-1000 m), and forest edge (1001-3000 m). A total of 975 adults were collected frequently belonging to the families Ascalaphidae, Coniopterygidae, and Hemerobiidae from the forest edges while Chrysopidae and Myrmeleontidae were most common along the mid-interior regions of the forest. Majority of adutls caught from the mid-interior region comprised of female adults while the males of most species were abundant along the forest edges. Although the forest center shows the largest value for the Dominance species-diversity index and the smallest value for the Shannon index, forest edge was found highest for the Simpson index. The abundance of Neuroptera decreased with wind speed but increased with the temperature in the edge regions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that some environmental and habitat variables, e.g. wind speed, temperature, and distance to the forest center, mid-interior and edge, accounted for species distribution patterns in Neuroptera. In the forest center, a linear correlation between wind speed, temperature and specimen abundance was recorded, while these factors were found negatively correlated with specimens abundance in the mid-interior regions of the forest.",

To identify genes capable of conveying Sorafenib resistance, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR transcriptional activation library (SAM) in human Huh7 cells. We identified that a group of sgRNAs were significantly enriched in Sorafenib resistant Huh7 cells, which indicated that these sgRNAs up-regulated their target genes and induced resistance. We finally identified LRP8 as a key gene that can drive HCC cell to acquire sorafenib resistance. All three sgRNAs targeting LRP8 were identified in Sorafenib resistant Huh7 cells with high copy. We also showed that sorafenib-acquired resistant Huh7 cells have much higher LRP8 expression level than parental Huh7 cells. We proved that overexpression of LRP8 in HCC cell lines activated beta-catenin and significantly promoted its resistance to Sorafenib. We further showed that overexpression of LRP8 reduced the apoptosis level of HCC cell lines. To summary, genome-scale CRISPR activation screening identifies a role of LRP8 in Sorafenib resistance in Hepatocellular carcinoma.",

We show that, under non-stress conditions, G3BP adopts a compact auto-inhibited state stabilized by electrostatic intramolecular interactions between the intrinsically disordered acidic tracts and the positively charged arginine-rich region. Upon release from polysomes, unfolded mRNAs outcompete G3BP auto-inhibitory interactions, engendering a conformational transition that facilitates clustering of G3BP through protein-RNA interactions. Subsequent physical crosslinking of G3BP clusters drives RNA molecules into networked RNA/protein condensates. We show that G3BP condensates impede RNA entanglement and recruit additional client proteins that promote SG maturation or induce a liquid-to-solid transition that may underlie disease. We propose that condensation coupled to conformational rearrangements and heterotypic multivalent interactions may be a general principle underlying RNP granule assembly.",

Here we report the synthesis of a zinc-layered hydroxide salt (LHS) and its use as a novel nanocontainer for this purpose, storing the corrosion inhibitor molybdate in the interlayer region of the LHS. Layered zinc hydroxide molybdate (ZHM) was obtained by anion-exchange reactions using layered zinc hydroxide acetate (ZHA) as a precursor, obtained by alkaline coprecipitation. The release behavior of molybdate from the ZHM nanocontainers in aqueous NaCl solution (0.05 mol/L) was evaluated using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The molybdate release from the ZHM nanocontainers was realized by the anion-exchange mechanism, where chloride anions replaced intercalated molybdate anions. The release was fast in the first minutes of exposure, followed by a controlled release afterward, reaching about 35% of cumulative amount of released molybdate after 30 days of exposure. The anticorrosion effect provided by the ZHM nanocontainers for carbon steel was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The steel substrate was coated with an epoxy resin loaded with ZHM nanocontainers (5 wt %) and immersed in an NaCl solution (0.05 mol/L) to evaluate the active mechanisms of inhibition and the anticorrosion properties of the loaded coating in comparison with a neat coating (blank). The coating loaded with ZHM nanocontainers presented the best corrosion protection performance, exhibiting an increase of R(C) (coating resistance) with the immersion time and superior R(P) (polarization resistance) for all the measured periods, compared to the blank. This effect is a consequence of the double mechanism of protection provided by the ZHM nanocontainers: (i) stimulus-response release of molybdate and its active inhibition in the scratched region by the formation of an insoluble protective film, simultaneously with (ii) removal of the corrosive chloride species from the medium.",

Secondary objective was to investigate the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies on T-ICH incidence. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study extracted data from electronic patient records. The cohort consisted of patients presenting after a fall and/or head injury and presented to one of five ED between 1st March 2010 and 31st July 2017. Inclusion criteria were age >/= 65 years old and a minor head trauma defined as an impact to the head without fulfilling criteria for traumatic brain injury. RESULTS: From the 1,000 electronic medical records evaluated, 311 cases were included. The mean age was 80.1 (SD 7.9) years. One hundred and eighty-nine (189) patients (60.8%) were on an anticoagulant (n = 69), antiplatelet (n = 130) or both (n = 16). Twenty patients (6.4%) developed a clinically significant T-ICH. Anticoagulation and/or antiplatelets therapies were not associated with an increased risk of clinically significant T-ICH in this cohort (Odds ratio (OR) 2.7, 95% CI 0.9-8.3). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of older adults presenting to the ED following minor head trauma, the incidence of clinically significant T-ICH was 6.4%.",

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a high degree of immune infiltrate in the tumour microenvironment, which may influence the fate of TNBC cells. We reveal that loss of the tumour suppressive transcription factor Elf5 in TNBC cells activates intrinsic interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signalling, promoting tumour progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, we find that loss of the Elf5-regulated ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 ensures stabilization of its putative protein substrate IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) at the protein level in TNBC. Elf5(low) tumours show enhanced IFN-gamma signalling accompanied by an increase of immunosuppressive neutrophils within the tumour microenvironment and increased programmed death ligand 1 expression. Inactivation of either programmed death ligand 1 or IFNGR1 elicited a robust anti-tumour and/or anti-metastatic effect. A positive correlation between ELF5 and FBXW7 expression and a negative correlation between ELF5, FBXW7 and IFNGR1 expression in the tumours of patients with TNBC strongly suggest that this signalling axis could be exploited for patient stratification and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for Elf5(low) patients with TNBC.",

DESIGN: Qualitative semistructured key informant interviews using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as a theoretical framework. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A community pharmacy in the metropolitan Piedmont region of North Carolina from February 2019 to May 2019. Prescriber and patient interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and independently coded by 2 investigators. A qualitative analysis was completed, with a selection of supporting quotations for each theme. OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative analysis of prescriber and patient perceptions of depression screening provided in community pharmacies, strategies for patient engagement, and coordination of care for depression screenings. RESULTS: Twelve patients and 4 prescribers participated in the study. The patient perceptions were categorized into 3 key themes: (1) private and confidential screenings; (2) disparate views regarding the potential interventions that pharmacists could offer; and (3) mental health stigma concerns. The prescriber perceptions were categorized into 3 key themes: (1) support for expanded access to depression screenings provided in community pharmacies; (2) necessity of referral algorithms for transitions of care; and (3) communication of full screening results for positive and negative screens. A mutual theme was identified among patients and prescribers: the view that mental health care provided at a community pharmacy was influenced by an established relationship with a community pharmacist. CONCLUSION: This study describes patient and provider perceptions of depression screening within the community pharmacy setting. Prescribers were supportive of community pharmacists' ability to close the gaps in access to care for patients with mental health conditions, whereas patients had mixed feelings that may have been influenced by concerns of privacy, confidentiality, and stigma. This deeper understanding of prescriber and patient perceptions of how community pharmacies could expand access to depression screening may provide a roadmap for offering these interventions in community pharmacies.",

        "abstract": "Defensive responses to transgressions can have a negative impact on decision-making within government and organizations, on relationships, and even an individual's well-being. Transgressors who are defensive are less likely to acknowledge or appreciate the extent of harm caused, and their responsibility in having contributed to it or in helping to repair it. It is therefore important to understand what situational factors increase or reduce defensiveness and, thus, offer solutions for those trying to foster responsibility-taking by individuals in relationships, organizations, and society. This paper presents two studies exploring what underpins defensive responses in the context of transgressions. In Study 1 (N = 202), participants recalled an interpersonal transgression, and in Study 2 (N = 143), omnivorous participants watched a guilt-eliciting documentary about meat production practices. Both studies demonstrate that defensiveness increases in response to social/moral threat. Further, Study 2 demonstrates that this defensiveness can be reduced by addressing the underlying threat to social/moral identity via value affirmation, encouraging moral engagement, and repair.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Previous studies have primarily focused on depression among older adults. Given that middle age links young adulthood to older adulthood and encompasses a variety of changes in roles and status, which influence depression, it is important to understand the changes of depression during this period. Methods: This study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. The final sample consisted of 834 individuals, and four points in time were used: 34, 36, 40, and 50 years of age. The Latent Growth Model (LGM) was used to estimate the trajectories of depression. Results: The trajectories of depression present a non-linear change, referring to V-shaped curve. The conditional model shows that there are significant individual differences on initial status. Males were negatively associated with the latent initial level of depression. Individuals who showed higher self-esteem and cognitive ability were negatively associated with the latent initial level of depression. In addition, health insurance was negatively associated with the latent initial levels of depression. Both employment and net worth predicted lower intercepts of depression. Discussion: As the 40s is a bridge between the lowest levels of depression and a gradual increase of depression, service providers should be aware of changes of depression among middle-aged adults and spend more time and resources to encourage those individuals to prepare for changes in depression. Prevention programs for depression and providing more opportunities for employment and education to save money should be more focused on young adults.",

There was a 2.8-fold increased risk of death for patients whose meningioma harbored an STK11 mutation, after controlling for lesion grade and occurrence status. The median overall survival for patients with STK11-mutated meningiomas was 4.4 years compared with 16.8 years. CONCLUSION: These data identify recurrent STK11 mutations in a subset of meningiomas.

        "abstract": "The Sansha Yongle Blue Hole is the world's deepest (301 m) underwater cave and has a sharp redox gradient, with oligotrophic, anoxic, and sulfidic bottom seawater. In order to discover the microbial communities and their special biogeochemical pathways in the blue hole, we analyzed the 16S ribosomal RNA amplicons and metagenomes of microbials from seawater depths with prominent physical, chemical, and biological features. Redundancy analysis showed that dissolved oxygen was the most important factor affecting the microbial assemblages of the blue hole and surrounding open sea waters, and significantly explained 44.7% of the total variation, followed by silicate, temperature, sulfide, ammonium, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, salinity, particulate organic carbon, and chlorophyll a. We identified a bloom of Alteromonas (34.9%) at the primary nitrite maximum occurring in close proximity to the chlorophyll a peak in the blue hole. Genomic potential for nitrate reduction of Alteromonas might contribute to this maximum under oxygen decrease. Genes that would allow for aerobic ammonium oxidation, complete denitrification, and sulfur-oxidization were enriched at nitrate/nitrite-sulfide transition zone (90 and 100 m) of the blue hole, but not anammox pathways. Moreover, gamma-Proteobacterial clade SUP05, epsilon-Proteobacterial genera Sulfurimonas and Arcobacter, and Chlorobi harbored genes for sulfur-driven denitrification process that mediated nitrogen loss and sulfide removal. In the anoxic bottom seawater (100-300 m), high levels of sulfate reducers and dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene (dsrA) potentially created a sulfidic zone of ~200 m thickness. Our findings suggest that in the oligotrophic Sansha Yongle Blue Hole, O(2) deficiency promotes nitrogen- and sulfur-cycling processes mediated by metabolically versatile microbials.",

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and only comparative studies published between 2000 and 2019 were included. Twenty-six nonrandomised comparative studies were included, recruiting a total of 167 80 patients. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment revealed high or uncertain RoB across all studies, with the vast majority being retrospective, observational studies with poorly matched controls and short follow-up. Limited data showed TA to be safe, but its long-term oncological effectiveness compared with PN remains uncertain. A quality assessment of pre-existing SRs (n=11) on the topic, using AMSTAR, revealed that all SRs had low confidence rating, with all but two SRs being rated critically low. In conclusion, the current data are inadequate to make any strong and clear conclusions regarding the clinical effectiveness of TA for treating T1N0M0 renal masses compared with PN. Therefore, TA may be cautiously considered an alternative to PN for T1N0M0 renal masses, but patients must be counselled carefully regarding the prevailing uncertainties. We recommend specific steps to improve the evidence base based on robust primary and secondary studies. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we looked at the literature to determine the effectiveness of thermoablation (TA) in the treatment of small kidney tumours compared with surgical removal. We found that TA could cautiously be offered as an option due to many remaining uncertainties regarding its effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) severely threatens human health, and the dysfunction of insulin-secreting beta cells in islets is related to the reduced PDX-1 expression. It has been reported that long non-coding RNA MALAT1 regulates beta cell function, while the potential mechanism is unclear. METHODS: Islets were isolated from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and wild type (WT) mice. Mouse islets and beta cell line (Min6) were stimulated by IL-1beta. The expression of MALAT1 was determined using real-time PCR, while the PDX-1 protein expression was determined using western blotting. ChIP-qPCR was carried out to determine the histone acetylation of the PDX-1 promoter. RESULTS: In NOD islets and IL-1beta-stimulated Min6 cells, the expression of MALAT1 was increased, while the mRNA and protein levels of PDX-1 were decreased at an age/time-dependent manner. Overexpressing MALAT1 suppressed the H3 histone acetylation of the PDX-1 promoter, inhibiting both mRNA and protein expressions of PDX-1. Knocking down MALAT1 restored the decrease of the histone acetylation of the PDX-1 promoter, as well as the PDX-1 expression, which was reduced by IL-1beta stimulation. Under high glucose stimulation, the overexpression of PDX-1 alone restored the insulin secretion which was inhibited by the simultaneous overexpression of MALAT1 and PDX-1. Under high glucose and IL-1beta stimulation, the simultaneous knockdown of MALAT1 and PDX-1 reduced the enhancement of the insulin secretion which was raised by knocking down MALAT1 alone. CONCLUSION: MALAT1 induces the dysfunction of beta cells via reducing the H3 histone acetylation of the PDX-1 promoter and subsequently inhibiting the expression of PDX-1, thus suppressing the insulin secretion.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Accurate HCV incidence estimates are critical for monitoring progress towards HCV elimination goals, including an 80% reduction in HCV incidence by 2030. Moreover, incidence estimates can help guide prevention and treatment programming, particularly in the context of the US opioid epidemic. METHODS: An inexpensive, Genedia-based HCV IgG antibody avidity assay was evaluated as a platform to estimate cross-sectional, population-level primary HCV incidence using 1,840 HCV antibody and RNA-positive samples from 875 individuals enrolled in 5 cohort studies in the US and India. Using samples collected <2 years following HCV seroconversion, the mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) was calculated by fitting a maximum likelihood binomial regression model to the probability of appearing recent. Among samples collected >/=2 years post-HCV seroconversion, an individual-level false recent ratio (FRR) was calculated by estimating the probability of appearing recent using an exact binomial test. Factors associated with falsely appearing recent among samples collected >/=2 years post seroconversion were determined by Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations and robust variance estimators. RESULTS: An avidity index cut-off of <40% resulted in an MDRI of 113 days (95% CI 84-146), and FRRs of 0.4% (95% CI 0.0-1.2), 4.6% (95% CI 2.2-8.3), and 9.5% (95% CI 3.6-19.6) among individuals who were HIV-uninfected, HIV-infected, and HIV-infected with a CD4 count <200/mul, respectively. No variation was seen between HCV genotypes 1 and 3. In hypothetical scenarios of high-risk settings, a sample size of <1,000 individuals could reliably estimate primary HCV incidence. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional approach can estimate primary HCV incidence for the most common genotypes. This tool can serve as a valuable resource for program and policy planners seeking to monitor and reduce HCV burden. LAY SUMMARY: Determining the rate of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in a population is critical to monitoring progress toward HCV elimination and to appropriately guide control efforts. However, since HCV infections are most often initially asymptomatic, it is difficult to estimate the rate of new HCV infections without following HCV-uninfected people over time and repeatedly testing them for HCV infection. Here, we present a novel, resource-efficient method to estimate the rate of new HCV infections in a population using data from a single timepoint.",

The recombination correction factor k (s) is investigated for clinically relevant energies between 70 MeV and 244 MeV for dose rates below 400 Gy min(-1) in air. The Boutillon formalism is used to separate the initial and general recombination. The general recombination is compared to predictions from the numerical recombination code IonTracks and the initial recombination to the Jaffe theory. k (s) is furthermore calculated with the two-voltage method (TVM) and extrapolation approaches, in particular the recently proposed three-voltage (3VL) method. The TVM is in agreement with the Boutillon method and IonTracks for dose rates above 100 Gy min(-1). However, the TVM calculated k (s) is closer related to the Jaffe theory for initial recombination for lower dose rate, indicating a limited application in scanning light ion beams. The 3VL is in turn found to generally be in agreement with Boutillon's method. The recombination is mapped as a function of the dose rate and proton energy at the two centres using the Boutillon formalism: the initial recombination parameter was found to be A = (0.10 +/- 0.01) V at DCPT and A = (0.22 +/- 0.13) V at Skandion, which is in better agreement with the Jaffe theory for initial recombination than previously reported values. The general recombination parameter was estimated to [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, the numerical algorithm IonTracks is demonstrated to correctly predict the initial recombination at low dose rates and the general recombination at high dose rates.",

Further, good control enables novel, transient operating strategies, such as conversion smoothing and demand response. Indirectly, control systems are key to the implementation and operation of more energy-efficient plant designs, as dictated by the process integration and intensification paradigms. These conclusions are supported with references to numerous examples from the literature.",

We aimed to establish AMH reference intervals and to determine the correlations between AMH level and age, body mass index (BMI), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone (TT) levels in healthy Chinese boys. METHODS: Serum AMH levels of 2,009 healthy boys (age, 0-14 years), recruited between October 2017 and April 2019, were determined using the Beckman Access 2 automated chemiluminescence immunoassay. Single-year-specific median, mean, and standard deviation (SD) of AMH and effects of age, BMI, FSH, LH, and TT on the AMH level were analyzed. RESULTS: The median and mean +/- SD values of AMH increased slightly after birth. Serum AMH values decreased sharply at 2 years of age and were 6-7% of the birth level at 12 years, after which they remained low. Age-specific AMH reference intervals were established. Significant negative correlations were observed between AMH level and age (r = -0.75, P < 0.001); serum AMH levels were moderately negatively correlated with BMI (r = -0.35, P < 0.001), FSH (r = -0.37, P < 0.001), and TT (r = -0.45, P < 0.001) levels; and correlation with LH (r = -0.18, P < 0.001) was the weakest. In contrast, correlations between AMH and the LH/FSH ratio were not observed. CONCLUSION: We established single-year-specific reference intervals for AMH in Chinese boys. Our findings revealed the changes in AMH secretion during normal male growth, and may provide a basis for the clinical use of AMH.",

        "abstract": "Rationale: Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Chemoresistance of temozolomide (TMZ), the first-line chemotherapeutic agent, is a major issue in the management of patients with glioma. Alterations of alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) gene constitute one of the most prevalent genetic abnormalities in gliomas. Therefore, elucidation of the role of ATRX contributing to TMZ resistance in glioma is urgently needed. Methods: We performed the bioinformatics analysis of gene expression, and DNA methylation profiling, as well as RNA and ChIP-seq data sets. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system was used to achieve the ATRX knockout in TMZ resistant cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out to investigate the role of ATRX contributing to TMZ resistance in glioma. Results: We found that ATRX expression was upregulated via DNA demethylation mediated by STAT5b/TET2 complex and strengthened DNA damage repair by stabilizing PARP1 protein in TMZ resistant cells. ATRX elicited PARP1 stabilization by the down-regulating of FADD expression via the H3K27me3 enrichment, which was dependent on ATRX/EZH2 complex in TMZ resistant cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the PARP inhibitor together with TMZ inhibited glioma growth in ATRX wild type TMZ resistant intracranial xenograft models. Conclusions: The present study further illustrated the novel mechanism of the ATRX/PARP1 axis contributing to TMZ resistance. Our results provided substantial new evidence that PARP inhibitor might be a potential adjuvant agent in overcoming ATRX mediated TMZ resistance in glioma.",

        "abstract": "Resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin has been documented in various types of cancer, while the increased expression of beta\u2011catenin has been observed in cisplatin\u2011resistant ovarian cancer. However, the involvement of beta\u2011catenin in cisplatin resistance is unclear. The present study investigated the antitumor effect of cisplatin on the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of breast cancer (BC) cells following beta\u2011catenin silencing in BC, which is the most frequent type of malignancy among women. The expression of beta\u2011catenin in BC tissues and cell lines was measured by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the association between expression levels and clinical characteristics was statistically analyzed. The viability of BC cell lines treated with siR\u2011beta\u2011catenin or with siR\u2011beta\u2011catenin and cisplatin in combination was determined using a Cell Counting Kit\u20118 assay. The migratory and invasive abilities of BC cells treated with both siR\u2011beta\u2011catenin and cisplatin were examined with Transwell assays. The CD44 antigen/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression ratio, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis levels of BC cells treated with siR\u2011beta\u2011catenin and cisplatin in combination were detected by flow cytometry. The expression levels of apoptosis\u2011associated proteins, including caspase\u20113/9, in the BC cells treated with both siR\u2011beta\u2011catenin and cisplatin were investigated by western blot analysis. The levels of apoptosis in the BC cells following combined treatment with siR\u2011beta\u2011catenin and cisplatin was further quantified by Hoechst 33342 staining. beta\u2011catenin was identified to be highly expressed in BC tissues and cell lines and was associated with pathological stage and lymph node status. Following knockdown of beta\u2011catenin expression, cisplatin treatment suppressed the viabilities, and the migratory and invasive capabilities of the T47D and MCF\u20117 cells, and induced extensive apoptosis. beta\u2011catenin knockdown upregulated caspase\u20113/9 levels following cisplatin treatment and induced the apoptosis of T47D and MCF\u20117 cells. In conclusion, beta\u2011catenin may be of value as a therapeutic target during cisplatin treatment in patients with BC treated with cisplatin.",

As a model system, the cubic phase structure of a POM-based IL, (C(7)H(15))(4)N(+)(7)PW(11)O(39), was determined to form in a wide range of temperatures, exhibiting good thermostability, excellent mechanical strength, and high viscosity. Furthermore, the lyotropic ionic liquid crystals formed by (C(7)H(15))(4)N(+)(7)PW(11)O(39) in solvents such as chloroform or toluene still maintained a cubic structure. These cubic ionic liquid crystals (CILCs) were used as anticorrosion coatings both in acidic and neutral environments. The electrochemical measurements of Cu and Fe surfaces coated by CILCs showed an excellent ability of anticorrosion, indicating that the metals can be perfectly protected by the CILC coatings with high resistance and low capacitance. We assume that the CILCs may serve as barriers to stop oxygen diffusing to metals and interrupt the electron tunnels between the metal surfaces and the electrolyte solutions. Such environmentally friendly CILCs of POMs-based ILs are convenient for coating and removal, being vital to versatile industrial and academic applications.",

A computational density functional theory (DFT) has been applied for the first time to determine the removal mechanism of zinc (Zn(2+) ), nickel (Ni(2+) ), and chromium (Cr(6+) ) hydrates onto the prepared MGO. The adsorption binding energy and geometries of the metal hydrates with oxygen functional group (i.e., hydroxyl, epoxide, carboxylic, carbonyl groups, and magnetite on the MGO surface) were estimated. The complexes configurations comprised via sitting the metal ion perpendicular and above the MGO surface. The zinc hydrate portended to bind more strongly than Ni(2+) and Cr(6+) . Zinc hydrate is favorable to coordinate with hydroxyl and carboxylic group than the other functional groups. The pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models are well convenient for kinetics and isotherm sorption process, respectively. The results determined that the sorption of heavy metals by nanostructure MGO was observed in the following order: zinc > nickel > chromium as revealed by the DFT computations. The maximum adsorption capacity of Zn(2+) , Ni(2+) , and Cr(6+) was 333, 250, and 200 mg/g, respectively. Thermodynamic constants depicted that the sorption process is naturally instantaneous and exothermic. The calculated predicted results are fitted with the experimental results. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Combination of MGO with DFT calculations in the sorption of Zn, Ni, and Cr hydrates. MGO applied on the removal of Zn(+2) , Ni(+2) , and Cr(+6) with high sorption capacity. DFT calculations revealed that Zn hydrate is more favorably adsorbed than others. DFT calculations proved that ZnOH is favorable to coordinate with OH and COOH groups. DFT calculation offers guidance on the mechanism of coordination of heavy metals.",

Subjective perception of exercise difficulty, or rate of perceived exertion (RPE), may especially be a barrier to exercise in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to changes in initiation and motivation that accompany changes in cognition and brain function. RPE is the most commonly used measure of subjective effort in exercise research, yet the relationship between RPE and objective fitness is not fully understood in older adults. A better understanding is needed to support initiation, engagement, and maintenance of exercise and determine the appropriateness for use of RPE as a measure in this population. Our study aimed to 1) evaluate the degree to which objective measures of cardiorespiratory fitness correlates with the most commonly used subjective measure of effort, RPE and 2) examine any difference in the relationship between objective cardiorespiratory fitness and RPE between individuals with and without AD. We explored these relationships during a graded exercise test. Objective fitness and subjective effort were negatively associated. Independent of cardiorespiratory fitness, older age, female gender, cognitive impairment, and use of heart medications predicted greater self-reported effort during exercise. Results are discussed in terms of social psychological phenomena and potential neuropsychological deficits leading to increased subjective feelings of effort. These findings establish that the RPE measure may not be appropriate and may even detract from effort during graded exercise testing among older adults with AD.",

The experiment was carried out in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated in an alternating anaerobic/aerobic mode with dissolved oxygen controlled at 1.0 mg . L(-1). The results showed that the optimum magnesium source,temperature, stirring speed and reaction equilibrium time for side-stream phosphorus recovery were: MgCl(2) . 6H(2)O, 25  degrees C, 150 rpm and 20 min, respectively. It was also observed that the average phosphorus removal efficiency of the mainstream system maintained as high as 90.7% during the side-stream extraction period despite insufficient time for phosphate uptake under limited dissolved oxygen condition and phosphate deprivation of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Besides, the sludge settling performance of the mainstream EBPR system decreased with no sludge loss. Afterwards, phosphorus removal and sludge settling performance were restored with dismissing side-stream phosphorus recovery. This study suggested that side-stream extraction of anaerobic supernatant from a mainstream EBPR subjected to low dissolved oxygen conditions for chemical phosphorus recovery was feasible and environmentally friendly.",

        "abstract": "Despite more than 250 years of taxonomic research, we still have only a vague idea about the true size and composition of the faunas and floras of the planet. Many biodiversity inventories provide limited insight because they focus on a small taxonomic subsample or a tiny geographic area. Here, we report on the size and composition of the Swedish insect fauna, thought to represent roughly half of the diversity of multicellular life in one of the largest European countries. Our results are based on more than a decade of data from the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative and its massive inventory of the country's insect fauna, the Swedish Malaise Trap Project The fauna is considered one of the best known in the world, but the initiative has nevertheless revealed a surprising amount of hidden diversity: more than 3,000 new species (301 new to science) have been documented so far. Here, we use three independent methods to analyze the true size and composition of the fauna at the family or subfamily level: (1) assessments by experts who have been working on the most poorly known groups in the fauna; (2) estimates based on the proportion of new species discovered in the Malaise trap inventory; and (3) extrapolations based on species abundance and incidence data from the inventory. For the last method, we develop a new estimator, the combined non-parametric estimator, which we show is less sensitive to poor coverage of the species pool than other popular estimators. The three methods converge on similar estimates of the size and composition of the fauna, suggesting that it comprises around 33,000 species. Of those, 8,600 (26%) were unknown at the start of the inventory and 5,000 (15%) still await discovery. We analyze the taxonomic and ecological composition of the estimated fauna, and show that most of the new species belong to Hymenoptera and Diptera groups that are decomposers or parasitoids. Thus, current knowledge of the Swedish insect fauna is strongly biased taxonomically and ecologically, and we show that similar but even stronger biases have distorted our understanding of the fauna in the past. We analyze latitudinal gradients in the size and composition of known European insect faunas and show that several of the patterns contradict the Swedish data, presumably due to similar knowledge biases. Addressing these biases is critical in understanding insect biomes and the ecosystem services they provide. Our results emphasize the need to broaden the taxonomic scope of current insect monitoring efforts, a task that is all the more urgent as recent studies indicate a possible worldwide decline in insect faunas.",

        "abstract": "Most accounts of behavior in nonhuman animals assume that they make choices to maximize expected reward value. However, model-free reinforcement learning based on reward associations cannot account for choice behavior in transitive inference paradigms. We manipulated the amount of reward associated with each item of an ordered list, so that maximizing expected reward value was always in conflict with decision rules based on the implicit list order. Under such a schedule, model-free reinforcement algorithms cannot achieve high levels of accuracy, even after extensive training. Monkeys nevertheless learned to make correct rule-based choices. These results show that monkeys' performance in transitive inference paradigms is not driven solely by expected reward and that appropriate inferences are made despite discordant reward incentives. We show that their choices can be explained by an abstract, model-based representation of list order, and we provide a method for inferring the contents of such representations from observed data.",

In this review, we focus on recent advances showing how mechanical force acts through the actin cytoskeleton to regulate the Hippo pathway during cell movement and cancer invasion. We also discuss how this force affects YAP-dependent tissue growth and cell proliferation, and how disruption of that homeostatic relationship contributes to cancer metastasis.",

There is limited depression research with WLWH in Vietnam. Twenty in-depth interviews with WLWH were conducted to identify pathways leading to depression and coping strategies for depression. Participants were recruited from an antiretroviral treatment clinic in northern Vietnam. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed, translated, and analysed to identify key themes. All participants reported sudden loss of social support, debilitating depression, and suicidal ideation in the first six months after HIV diagnosis. While some were able to cope with their status after several months, others continued to struggle due to HIV-related stigma that was perceived as more isolating for WLWH than for men. Women who were able to effectively cope with depression found ways to re-establish connections to family and community. Interventions to improve mental wellbeing should link WLWH to mental health services immediately after diagnosis and address loss of support and stigma, as they contributed to the onset and persistence of depression after HIV diagnosis. Community-level HIV stigma reduction interventions may also help repair broken social bonds and foster new ones.",

        "abstract": "Molecular-level multielectron handling toward electrical storage is a worthwhile approach to solar energy harvesting. Here, a strategy which uses chemical bonds as electron reservoirs is introduced to demonstrate the new concept of \"structronics\" (a neologism derived from \"structure\" and \"electronics\"). Through this concept, we establish, synthesize, and thoroughly study two multicomponent \"super-electrophores\": 1,8-dipyridyliumnaphthalene, 2, and its N,N-bridged cyclophane-like analogue, 3. Within both of them, a covalent bond can be formed and subsequently broken electrochemically. These superelectrophores are based on two electrophoric (pyridinium) units that are, on purpose, spatially arranged by a naphthalene scaffold. A key characteristic of 2 and 3 is that they possess a LUMO that develops through space as the result of the interaction between the closely positioned electrophoric units. In the context of electron storage, this \"super-LUMO\" serves as an empty reservoir, which can be filled by a two-electron reduction, giving rise to an elongated C-C bond or \"super-HOMO\". Because of its weakened nature, this bond can undergo an electrochemically driven cleavage at a significantly more anodic-yet accessible-potential, thereby restoring the availability of the electron pair (reservoir emptying). In the representative case study of 2, an inversion of potential in both of the two-electron processes of bond formation and bond-cleavage is demonstrated. Overall, the structronic function is characterized by an electrochemical hysteresis and a chemical reversibility. This structronic superelectrophore can be viewed as the three-dimensional counterpart of benchmark methyl viologen (MV).",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of lung cancer, which is highly metastatic, leading to the poor survival rate of patients. We recently reported that 4-[4-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)phenoxy]phenol (4-HPPP), a phenoxyphenol, exerts antihepatoma effects by inducing apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, we further examined the effect of 4-HPPP and its analogs on NSCLC cells. Colony formation assays showed that 4-HPPP exerts selective cytotoxicity against NSCLC H1299 cells; furthermore, the inhibitory effect of 4-HPPP on the proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells was validated using an in vivo zebrafish-based tumor xenograft assay. The flow cytometry-based dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) assays indicated that 4-HPPP caused an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in NSCLC cells, and Western blot assays showed that the major ROS scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutases- (SODs-) 1/2 were upregulated, whereas peroxidase (PRX) was downregulated. Furthermore, 4-HPPP caused both aneuploidization and the accumulation of gammaH2AX, a sensor of DNA damage, as well as the activation of double-strand break (DSB) markers, especially Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) in NSCLC cells. Our present work suggests that the antiproliferative effects of 4-HPPP on lung cancer cells could be due to its phenoxyphenol structure, and 4-HPPP could be a candidate molecule for treating NSCLC by modulating ROS levels and lowering the threshold of polyploidy-specific cell death in the future.",

Additional anterior transarticular C1-2 screws were placed to address C1-2 instability. Both patients made an uneventful clinical recovery. One of the anterior C1-2 screws loosened due to the poor purchase in the osteoporotic bone in one patient. This did not affect the final outcome, and both the patients demonstrated maintained reduction and good alignment of odontoid peg after 2 years of follow-up.

METHODS: The BIPSE intervention was developed through a multistage \"design for implementation\" process, including a series of stakeholder meetings, observations of probation supervision sessions, incorporating existing intervention approaches, and workshopping initial BIPSE components with three randomly selected officers from a specialized mental health probation unit. Acceptability and feasibility of BIPSE components were assessed through focus groups with probation officers, additional observations of probation sessions, and qualitative interviews with probationers with SMI. RESULTS: Two foundational components of the BIPSE intervention were identified during the stakeholder meetings and observations: (1) engagement and (2) shared decision-making. These two components inform and undergird the intervention's third component, strategic case management. During focus groups, probation officers expressed interest in using the modified tools they were given and also saw the benefit of structuring their sessions. Probationers expressed their appreciation for the caring and collaborative nature with which their probation officers approached their sessions. CONCLUSION: Building a therapeutic relationship between probation officers and probationers with SMI is an essential task toward improving mental health and criminal justice outcomes. The BIPSE development and refinement process demonstrates that interventions targeting the therapeutic relationship are acceptable to officers and clients, and can be tailored and feasibly structured into standard probation practices.",

In this study, we tested whether the daily temporal dynamics of an ant community in a tropical mountainous ecosystem is driven by daily fluctuations of abiotic factors, such as temperature and humidity. We also investigated whether the strong oscillation in daily temperature leads to high heterogeneity in ant species thermal responses. We have found that air and soil temperatures positively influenced the richness and frequency of foraging ants, while air humidity caused the opposite effect. Ant activity followed daily temperature fluctuations, which resulted in subtle differences in foraging patterns featured by heat-tolerant and heat-intolerant species. Moreover, the studied ant community exhibited broad and highly overlapped thermal responses, suggesting a likely resilience under temperature oscillations. Lastly, identifying how species traits are linked to oscillations in abiotic conditions is a necessary step to predict the effects of future climatic changes on biological community dynamics and ecosystem functioning.",

Meanwhile, it is a well-known fact that local anesthetics are much more than just \"simple\" sodium channel blockers. They also interact with numerous other ion channels and subcellular structures, enhancing nerve blockade and resulting in systemic \"alternative\" effects, which can sometimes even be clinically used. By the simultaneous administration of various adjuvants (e.g., opioids, corticosteroids and alpha(2)-receptor agonists) attempts are made to prolong the time of action of local anesthetics after a single administration in order to achieve the best possible improvement in postoperative analgesia. In this context, ultralong-acting local anesthetics, such as liposomal bupivacaine, which at least theoretically can provide a sensory nerve block for several days, have been developed and clinically introduced. The coming years will show whether these approaches will develop into genuine alternatives to the personnel and cost-intensive continuous nerve blockades.Local anesthetic-induced systemic toxicity is meanwhile rare but still a potentially life-threatening event, frequently resulting from accidental intravascular injection or extensive systemic resorption. Consequently, slow and fractional application of these agents with intermittent aspiration helps to prevent toxic sequelae. If toxic symptoms occur, however, the intravenous infusion of 20% lipid solutions in addition to basic treatment measures can enhance the success of treatment.",

This study intends to assess survivors of violent injury for resilience and PTG to better inform mental health interventions. METHODS: Adults who presented with nonaccidental penetrating trauma to an urban level 1 trauma center and were at least 1 month, but no more than 12 months, from treatment were eligible. Participants completed the Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale, Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder screen, and a community violence exposure screen. Additional demographic, injury, and treatment factors were collected from medical record. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients participated. The mean resiliency score was 83.2, with 71.1% scoring higher than the general population and 96.4% scoring higher than the reported scores of those seeking treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants demonstrated a mean PTGI score of 78 (SD, 20.4) with 92.4% scoring above the significant growth threshold of 45. In addition, 60.5% of patients screened positive for significant PTSD symptoms, approximately eight times higher than general population. Exposure to other traumatic events was high; an overwhelming 94% of participants stated that they have had a family member or a close friend killed, and 42% had personally witnessed a homicide. Higher resilience scores correlated with PTGI scores (p < 0.001) and lower PTSD screen (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Victims of violent injury experience a myriad of traumatic events yet are highly resilient and exhibit traits of growth across multiple domains. Resiliency can coexist with posttraumatic stress symptoms. Practitioners should assess for resiliency and PTG in addition to PTSD. Further investigation is needed to clarify the relational balance between resilience and posttraumatic stress. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Epidemiological study type, Level II.",

        "abstract": "Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are common among patients attending pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and may compromise its outcomes. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) seems one of the few exercise modalities that can actually be continued during AECOPD, due to its low burden on the impaired respiratory and cardiovascular system. However, the quality of evidence is low. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of mild-to-moderate AECOPD on adherence/outcomes of a high-frequency (HF) or low-frequency (LF) NMES training program, as part of inpatient PR, in severely dyspneic, weakened individuals with COPD. 62 patients who received NMES as the sole supervised muscle training modality during an 8-week PR program (HF-NMES: n = 33; LF-NMES: n = 29) were analyzed retrospectively. 48.4% experienced >/=1 AECOPD during PR and were classified as exacerbators. Exacerbators completed 75 NMES sessions (interquartile range: 73-78) and were able to increase training intensity with 24 mA (15-39), while non-exacerbators completed 76 sessions (73-79) and increased training intensity with 35 mA (22-50), with no between-group differences (p = 0.474 and p = 0.065, respectively). The median change in 6-min walking distance, cycle endurance time, and isokinetic quadriceps strength and endurance did not differ between the exacerbation and non-exacerbation group. To conclude, the occurrence of mild-to-moderate AECOPD during a PR program primarily focused on NMES, does not affect adherence, intensity, and clinical outcomes in patients with severe COPD. Continuing NMES seems a feasible way to potentially counteract exacerbation-related lower-limb muscle dysfunction and improve outcomes of PR, with HF-NMES being the preferential muscle training modality.",

        "abstract": "Hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) coating is widely used in a solid rocket motor, but an aging phenomenon exists during long-term storage, which causes irreversible damage to the performance of this HTPB coating. In order to study the effect of aging on the dynamic mechanical properties of the HTPB coating, the thermally-accelerated aging test was carried out. The variation of maximum elongation and crosslinking density with aging time was obtained, and a good linear relationship between maximum elongation and crosslinking density was found by correlation analysis. The changing regularity of dynamic mechanical properties with aging time was analyzed. It was found that with the increase of aging time, T(g) of HTPB coating increased, T(alpha), tan beta and tan alpha decreased, and the functional relationships between the loss factor parameters and crosslinking density were constructed. The storage modulus and loss modulus of HTPB coating increased with the increase of aging time, and decreased with the increase of pre-strain. The aging enhanced the Payne effect of HTPB coating, while the pre-strain had a weakening effect. In view of the Payne effect of HTPB coating, the crosslinking density was introduced into Kraus model as aging evaluation parameter, and the crosslinking density modified models with and without pre-strain were established. The proposed models can effectively solve the problem that the Kraus model has a poor fitting effect under the condition of small strain (generally less than 1%) and on the loss modulus, which have improved the correlations between the fitting results and the test results.",

Reasons for revision include recurrence of stenosis, non-union, implant failure, infection, adjacent segment degeneration and flat back fusion. With the rise in elective lumbar fusion rates, it is expected that the rate for revision spinal surgery will also increase with time. The use of minimal invasive surgical techniques for revision spinal surgery is controversial. Careful patient and technique selection is important in achieving satisfactory outcome in revision spinal surgery. METHODS: This article outlines our algorithm for selecting the appropriate minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques for revision lumbar spinal surgery. Surgical options range from decompression employing MIS techniques to open osteotomies, but the optimal approach comes down to two deciding factors: (I) nature of previous surgery and (II) spinopelvic parameters. RESULTS: Representative revision cases managed using MIS techniques based on proposed revision algorithm are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed algorithm provides surgeons with a systematic approach in selecting the appropriate combination of MIS techniques for revision lumbar spinal surgery based on pathology and sagittal alignment.",

This study aimed to explore wherethe most variable region is in leptin gene and analyse microsatellite repeats with direct sequencing in Iraqis and compare our alleles with other populations as a risk for obesity and T2D predisposition. DNA was extracted from blood of 60 type 2 diabetics and 70 non diabetics individuals, LEP 5\u201bUTR, exon 2 and 3 were screened in 45 individuals (24 type 2 diabetes patients and 21 non- diabetics), LEP TTTC repeats region were amplified in all 130 participants from which 22 control samples were purified and sequenced, superimposed sequences were analyzed manually. Sequencing results showed G>A polymorphism (rs2167270) in 5\u201bUTR region. No polymorphisms detected in LEP exons 2 and 3. LEP microsatellites alleles were classified depending on sizes into class1 < (220bp) and class2 (> 220bp). Analysis of 22 control samples sequences of microsatellite region resulted in 6 type1 allele (unique sequence) and 5 type 3 allele (13 different isoforms) depending on TTTC arrangement separated by Ts bases. We concluded that LEP variations were in non- coding regions and no significant difference was observed in allele frequency between both groups, but there was a huge diversity in microsatellite repeat number and context among individuals. This may affects gene function thus prepare a predisposition for obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Objective: In this study, we compared in vitro and in vivo bioactivity of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NDMWCNT) to MWCNT to test the hypothesis that nitrogen doping would alter bioactivity.Materials and Methods: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the multilayer structure of MWCNT with an average layer distance of 0.36 nm, which was not altered by nitrogen doping: the nanomaterials had similar widths and lengths. In vitro studies with THP-1 cells and alveolar macrophages from C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that NDMWCNT were less cytotoxic and stimulated less IL-1beta release compared to MWCNT. For in vivo studies, male C57BL/6J mice received a single dose of dispersion medium (DM), 2.5, 10 or 40 microg/mouse of NDMWCNT, or 40 microg/mouse of MWCNT by oropharyngeal aspiration. Animals were euthanized between 1 and 7 days post-exposure for whole lung lavage (WLL) studies.Results and Discussion: NDMWCNT caused time- and dose-dependent pulmonary inflammation. However, it was less than that caused by MWCNT. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was assessed in particle-exposed mice by determining cytokine production in WLL fluid at 1 day post-exposure. Compared to DM-exposed mice, IL-1beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in MWCNT- and NDMWCNT-exposed mice, but the increase caused by NDMWCNT was less than MWCNT. At 56 days post-exposure, histopathology determined lung fibrosis in MWCNT-exposed mice was greater than NDMWCNT-exposed mice.Conclusions: These data indicate nitrogen doping of MWCNT decreases their bioactivity, as reflected with lower in vitro and in vivo toxicity inflammation and lung disease. The lower activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may be responsible.

Here we report a de novo tetrasomy 18p. METHODS: The copy number variation of the patient was detected by microarray. Whether the abnormal gene was inherited from the parents was detected by karyotype analysis. Then the source of the chromosome was located by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Finally, we used MLPA technology to validate the results of patient testing. RESULTS: Microarray detection found that patients with 18p11.32p11.21 had duplication, with a copy number of four, which was tetrasomy 18 syndrome. The karyotype results showed 48,XY,+2mar?. Chromosome 18 telomere probe FISH experimental results: 48,XY,+i(18)(p10),+mar.ish. MLPA results showed that the number of chromosome 18 short arm copies is increased. Karyotype analysis results of his mother were 47,XX,+mar. Microarray results showed normal. Karyotype results of his father were normal. CONCLUSIONS: This case is de novo case, the patient's marker chromosome may be inherited from his mother, which does not rule out the influence of his mother's marker chromosome on his isochromosome 18.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: HIV testing guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are continually changing to reflect advancements in new testing technology. Evaluation of existing and new point-of-care (POC) HIV tests is crucial to inform testing guidelines and provide information to clinicians and other HIV test providers. Characterizing the performance of POC HIV tests using unprocessed specimens can provide estimates for the window period of detection, or the time from HIV acquisition to test positivity, which allows clinicians and other HIV providers to select the appropriate POC HIV tests for persons who may be recently infected with HIV. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocols and procedures used to evaluate the performance of the newest POC tests and determine their sensitivity during early HIV infection. METHODS: Project DETECT is a CDC-funded study that is evaluating POC HIV test performance. Part 1 is a cross-sectional, retrospective study comparing behavioral characteristics and HIV prevalence of the overall population of the Public Health-Seattle & King County (PHSKC) Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinic to Project DETECT participants enrolled in part 2. Part 2 is a cross-sectional, prospective study evaluating POC HIV tests in real time using unprocessed whole blood and oral fluid specimens. A POC nucleic acid test (NAT) was added to the panel of HIV tests in June 2018. Part 3 is a longitudinal, prospective study evaluating seroconversion sensitivity of POC HIV tests through serial follow-up testing. For comparison, HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1/HIV-2 antigen/antibody tests are also performed for participants enrolled in part 2 or 3. A behavioral survey that collects information about demographics, history of HIV testing, STD history, symptoms of acute HIV infection, substance use, sexual behaviors in the aggregate and with recent partners, and use of pre-exposure prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy is completed at each part 2 or 3 visit. RESULTS: Between September 2015 and March 2019, there were 14,990 Project DETECT-eligible visits (part 1) to the PHSKC STD Clinic resulting in 1819 part 2 Project DETECT study visits. The longitudinal study within Project DETECT (part 3) enrolled 27 participants with discordant POC test results from their part 2 visit, and 10 (37%) were followed until they had fully seroconverted with concordant positive POC test results. Behavioral survey data and HIV test results, sensitivity, and specificity will be presented elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Studies such as Project DETECT are critical for evaluating POC HIV test devices as well as describing characteristics of persons at risk for HIV acquisition in the United States. HIV tests in development, including POC NATs, will provide new opportunities for HIV testing programs. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR1-10.2196/16332.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-pressure water jet injuries are an uncommon cause of trauma. Highpressure water injuries are usually seen at the extremities and less often in the thorax and abdominal areas. A review of the literature reveals a few case reports describing intraabdominal injuries due to penetrating trauma. In this paper, we present the radiological findings of a rare case of abdominal wall injury without penetration of peritoneum caused by high-pressure water jet due to the Coanda effect. The Coanda effect is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a curved. In our case, the peritoneum also functions as flat and curved surface, causing non-penetrant abdominal wall injury. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old male working at a hydroelectric terminal presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a two-centimeter cutaneous gap in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen caused by high-pressure water. The CT findings revealed a small entrance to left lower quadrant of the abdominal wall and extensive subcutaneous injury. There was no internal injury. The cutaneous gap was managed by primary surgical closure. Subcutaneous emphysema was diminished on the follow up physical examination. The patient was recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSION: The water jet can cause a wide subcutaneous injury by following the peritoneum even though there is a small entrance. Therefore radiological imaging can help to determine their severity and planning treatment.",

These questions have inherent value for understanding normal human physiology, but also directly inform our comprehension of the process by which the system is subverted to drive diseases of the blood, in particular blood cancers and bone marrow failure syndromes. The critical link between normal and abnormal hematopoiesis is perhaps best illustrated by the recent discovery of clonal hematopoiesis in healthy people with no abnormal blood parameters. In such individuals, large clones derived from single cells are present and are dominant relative to their normal counterparts, but their presence does not necessitate abnormal blood cell production. Intriguingly, however, these individuals are also at a significantly greater risk of developing leukemias and of cardiovascular events, underscoring the importance of understanding how blood stem cell clones compete against each other.",

        "abstract": "smartPearls technology is one appropriate method to produce anti-psoriatic curcumin (Cur) topical delivery system. To prevent the sedimentation of loaded silica and release changing over the storage, which are disadvantages of smartPearls production, extra glycyrrhizic acid (GA) was added in classical smartPearls ingredients (active and porous material) to get an improved smartPearls production (Cur-GA-silica). The capacity of Cur-GA-silica to remain the gelation state after mixing with water was superior compared to that of the solid cluster without GA and that of the physical mixture of Cur, GA and silica. The Cur-GA-silica practically contained Cur with 1.68% +/- 0.12% and showed significant difference with Cur raw drug powder in kinetic solubilities (4.55 +/- 0.78 microg/mL vs 0 in 5 min; 3.26 +/- 0.17 microg/mL vs 0 in 4 h) which was traceable to the amorphous state of Cur-GA-silica detected by X-ray diffractometer. With the amorphous Cur, two times as much penetrated Cur in Cur-GA-silica as in Cur raw drug powder was achieved on the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mice model. The anti-psoriatic efficacy of Cur-GA-silica was confirmed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) evaluation, histological evaluation and decreased IL-17A in the imiquimod-induced psoriasiform mouse skin analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In conclusion, with the addition of GA, a stable amorphous curcumin topical vehicle fabricated by smartPearls technology without extra dermal matrix is available and facilitates penetration efficacy and anti-psoriatic capacity in imiquimod-induced psoriasiform mice.",

To ensure cross-sample validity, 323 heterosexual women and 323 lesbian women, ranging in age from 18 to 29 years, were matched for possible confounding variables. Lesbian women scored significantly higher (d = 0.27) on the Desire subscale of the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, but not on the Behavior (d = 0.07) and Attitude subscales (d = 0.11). Concerning gender role orientation, heterosexual women were characterized by significantly higher scores on the Femininity scale (d = 0.20), whereas lesbian women showed more pronounced masculine gender role orientation (d = 0.16). Structural equation modeling revealed two functionally distinct relationships between sexual orientation and sociosexuality, on the one hand, and between gender role orientation and sociosexuality, on the other hand. Sociosexual desire was exclusively associated with a woman's sexual orientation with no indication of any mediating effect of gender role orientation. Sociosexual behavior was positively related to a woman's level of masculine gender role orientation, while sociosexual attitude was positively associated with masculine and negatively associated with feminine gender role orientation, irrespective of sexual orientation.",

Examples include connexin, innexin and pannexin, which form gap junctions and/or bona fide cell surface channels. The most recently identified large-pore channels are the calcium homeostasis modulators (CALHMs), through which ions and ATP permeate in a voltage-dependent manner to control neuronal excitability, taste signaling and pathologies of depression and Alzheimer's disease. Despite such critical biological roles, the structures and patterns of their oligomeric assembly remain unclear. Here, we reveal the structures of two CALHMs, chicken CALHM1 and human CALHM2, by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which show novel assembly of the four transmembrane helices into channels of octamers and undecamers, respectively. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that lipids can favorably assemble into a bilayer within the larger CALHM2 pore, but not within CALHM1, demonstrating the potential correlation between pore size, lipid accommodation and channel activity.",

Here, we show that while many proliferating LEC-educated T cells enter early apoptosis, the remainders comprise a long-lived memory subset, with transcriptional, metabolic, and phenotypic features of central memory and stem cell-like memory T cells. In vivo, these memory cells preferentially home to lymph nodes and display rapid proliferation and effector differentiation following memory recall, and can protect mice against a subsequent bacterial infection. These findings introduce a new immunomodulatory role for LECs in directly generating a memory-like subset of quiescent yet antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells that are long-lived and can rapidly differentiate into effector cells upon inflammatory antigenic challenge.",

METHOD: This is an ecological study of trends based on three time periods (2000-2003, 2004-2008 and 2009-2014). The units of analysis were the small areas of nine European urban areas. We used a composite deprivation index as a socioeconomic indicator, along with other single indicators. As a mortality indicator, we used the smoothed standardized mortality ratio, calculated using the hierarchical Bayesian model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie. To analyse the evolution of socioeconomic inequalities, we fitted an ecological regression model that included the socioeconomic indicator, the period of time, and the interaction between these terms. RESULTS: We observed significant inequalities in mortality among men for almost all the socioeconomic indicators, periods, and urban areas studied. However, no significant changes occurred during the period of the economic crisis. While inequalities among women were less common, there was a statistically significant increase in inequality during the crisis period in terms of unemployment and the deprivation index in Prague and Stockholm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Future analyses should also consider time-lag in the effect of crises on mortality and specific causes of death, and differential effects between genders.",

Nutrients are important biogenic elements for algal growth. It is of great significance to examine the fluctuation characteristics of nutrients in the process of brown tide to understand the nutritional mechanism of brown tide. Based on the survey data of 30 stations located in Qinhuangdao coastal area from April to June 2014, we analyzed nutrient characteristics during the occurrence of brown tide and its relationship with the population dynamics of Aureococcus anophagefferens. The results showed that the concentration of dissolved nitrogen (DN) in April, May and June 2014 was 265.65, 355.36 and 323.71 mug.L(-1) respectively, and the concentration of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was 196.98, 242.88 and 177.69 mug.L(-1), accounting for 74.2%, 68.3% and 54.9% of DN, respectively. The concentration of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in April, May and June was 15.95, 11.39 and 11.14 mug.L(-1) respectively. In April and May, PO(4)(3-)-P accounted for a large proportion of the DP, 74.8% and 80.9% respectively. In June, the proportion of PO(4)(3-)-P in DP fell to 33.8%, and the proportion of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) in DP rose to 66.2%. The concentration of SiO(3)(2-)-Si in April, May and June was 70.95, 181.13 and 120.68 mug.L(-1), respectively. Except for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in May and DON, the distribution of other nutrients had clear characteristics that it decreased gradually from inshore to the offshore, with the relatively high concentrations in river mouth. Through R-factor analysis and nutrient structure analysis, it was found that in April, brown tide was at the development stage, and DOP might be the main driving factor for the growth of A. anophagefferens. In May, brown tide was at the maintenance stage, and water temperature became the main controlling factor. When water temperature was higher than 12 \u2103, brown tide could occur. In June, brown tide began to decay, and PO(4)(3-)-P had greater effects on the community structure of phytoplankton. DON was the important factor causing the outbreak of brown tide, with a concentration threshold of 150 mug.L(-1) and the ratio DON/DIN being greater than 1.",

        "abstract": "Steel fiber has become a proven material that can significantly alter the behavior of different types of concrete mixtures from brittle to more ductile ones. Rich literature is currently available on the mechanical properties of steel fiber-reinforced self-compacting concrete. However, the investigation of the impact resistance of this material to drop weight is still required to enrich the knowledge about its behavior under different loading conditions. An experimental work was conducted in this research to evaluate the performance of steel fiber-reinforced self-compacting concrete under repeated impact loading using the repeated blows test recommended by ACI 544-2R. The tests investigated the effect of drop weight and drop height in addition to fiber content. Straight micro-steel fibers were incorporated in three volumetric contents of 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0% and were compared with a similar plain mixture. The test equipment was adjusted to conduct repeated impact loading from different drop-heights and using different drop-weights. The adopted drop-heights were 450, 575 and 700 mm, while the adopted drop-weights were 4.5, 6.0 and 7.5 kg. The combination of the adopted drop-heights and weights composes four loading cases in addition to the standard loading case with a drop-weight and drop-height of 4.5 kg and 450 mm. The inclusion of micro steel fiber was found to significantly increase the impact resistance of self-compacting concrete with percentage developments ranging from 150 to 860% compared to plain samples. The specimens tested under 4.5 kg and 450 mm drop weight and height exhibited the highest percentage improvement in impact resistance among the five loading cases. The results also showed that the impact ductility of fibrous specimens was up to 24% higher than that of plain specimens.",

METHODS: We examinedthe hand motor performance of 23 individuals (12 males, 11 females, 42.6 +/- 13.7 years old) with ID of heterogeneous aetiology. All subjects were required to write a sentence and draw circles under various conditions. Kinematic parameters were calculated to quantify hand motion. RESULTS: Individuals with ID exhibit serious hand motor impairments suggestive of bradykinesia, irregularity, and micrographia. More than half of our ID patients (60.9%) displayed obsessive-compulsive symptoms of moderate severity (Y-BOCS total score: 16.6 +/- 8.3). Interestingly, the ID patients with OCD displayed smaller amplitudes of hand motor movements than did patients with no obsessive-compulsive symptoms, while differences observed in the writing and drawing concentric circles trials were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study support the use of kinematic analyses of handwriting movements to evaluate motor abnormalities in patients with ID and comorbid mental illnesses.",

Some children will experience very low platelet counts or even intracranial hemorrhage with devastating consequences, whereas others are largely unaffected. At the moment, predictive tools to forecast the severity of FNAIT during pregnancy are not available and over- or under-treatment may put the mother or the fetus at risk. A number of potential modulators of FNAIT severity have been reported. Maternal immune responses differ in respect to the IgG subtype composition, the glycosylation pattern of the antibodies, their fine specificity, and their functional effects on platelets, the trophoblast, and endothelial cells. In addition, antibody levels are variable. The efficacy of IgG transfer and, on the fetal side, gender and inflammatory responses, were also investigated for their potential impact on FNAIT severity. These potential risk modulators are scrutinized for available experimental and clinical evidence. Antibody glycosylation and anti-endothelial activity are hot candidates which, most likely in conjunction with the antibody level, should be explored further as tools to stratify fetal risk.",

In contrast, far less is known about how heterogeneity in human iNKT cells relates to disease. To address this, we used a high-dimensional, data-driven approach to devise a framework for parsing human iNKT heterogeneity. Our data revealed novel and previously described iNKT cell phenotypes with distinct functions. In particular, we found 2 phenotypes of interest: (1) a population with T helper 1 function that was increased with iNKT activation characterized by HLA-II+CD161- expression, and (2) a population with enhanced cytotoxic function characterized by CD4-CD94+ expression. These populations correlate with acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and with new onset type 1 diabetes, respectively. Our study identifies human iNKT cell phenotypes associated with human disease that could aid in the development of biomarkers or therapeutics targeting iNKT cells.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: According to the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), youth e-cigarette use (vaping) rose between 2017 and 2018. Frequency of vaping and concurrent past 30-day (p30d) use of e-cigarettes and tobacco products have not been reported. METHODS: We analyzed the 2018 NYTS (N = 20 189) for vaping among all students (middle and high school; 6-12th grades; 9-19 years old) by frequency of vaping, exclusive vaping, p30d poly-product use (vaping and use of one or more tobacco product), and any past tobacco product use. RESULTS: In 2018, 81.4% of students had not used any tobacco or vapor product in the p30d, and 86.2% had not vaped in the p30d. Among all students, of the 13.8% vaped in the p30d, just over half vaped on </=5 days (7.0%), and roughly a quarter each vaped on 6-19 days (3.2%) and on 20+ days (3.6%). Almost three quarters of p30d vapers (9.9%) reported past or concurrent tobacco use and the remainder (3.9%) were tobacco naive. 2.8% of students were tobacco naive and vaped on </=5 days; 0.7% were tobacco-naive and vaped on 6-19 days, and 0.4% were tobacco-naive and vaped on 20+ days. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping increased among US youth in 2018 over 2017. The increases are characterized by patterns of low p30d vaping frequency and high poly-product use, and a low prevalence of vaping among more frequent but tobacco naive vapers. IMPLICATIONS: Results underscore the importance of including the full context of use patterns. The majority of vapers (60.0%-88.9% by use frequency) were concurrent p30d or ever tobacco users. About 4% of students were tobacco naive and vaped in the p30d, but few (0.4%) vaped regularly on 20 or more days. Reporting youth vaping data with frequency and tobacco product co-use will give public health decision-makers the best possible information to protect public health.",

The kind of questions presented in these examples cover identification, classification, comparison and quantification of illicit drugs. The examples include several types of data (low- or high-dimensional), pre-processing and chemometric analyses that are applied to answer the questions presented. The performance measures for the chemometric methods are described based on separate datasets for training and testing (validation) purposes. In this way it is illustrated how a chemometric method is set up and data analysis may be performed.

It can be caused by excessive energy consumption but also by decreased energy dissipation, which occurs under several conditions including when the development or activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is impaired. Here we evaluated whether iRhom2, the essential cofactor for the Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) sheddase ADAM17/TACE, plays a role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: We challenged WT versus iRhom2 KO mice to positive energy balance by chronic exposure to a high fat diet and then compared their metabolic phenotypes. We also carried out ex vivo assays with primary and immortalized mouse brown adipocytes to establish the autonomy of the effect of loss of iRhom2 on thermogenesis and respiration. RESULTS: Deletion of iRhom2 protected mice from weight gain, dyslipidemia, adipose tissue inflammation, and hepatic steatosis and improved insulin sensitivity when challenged by a high fat diet. Crucially, the loss of iRhom2 promotes thermogenesis via BAT activation and beige adipocyte recruitment, enabling iRhom2 KO mice to dissipate excess energy more efficiently than WT animals. This effect on enhanced thermogenesis is cell-autonomous in brown adipocytes as iRhom2 KOs exhibit elevated UCP1 levels and increased mitochondrial proton leak. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that iRhom2 is a negative regulator of thermogenesis and plays a role in the control of adipose tissue homeostasis during metabolic disease.",

        "abstract": "tDCS has been used to treat various brain disorders and its mechanism of action (MoA) was found to be neuronal polarization. Since the blood-brain barrier (BBB) tightly regulates the neuronal microenvironment, we hypothesized that another MoA of tDCS is direct vascular activation by modulating the BBB structures to increase its permeability (P). To test this hypothesis, we used high resolution multiphoton microscopy to determine P of the cerebral microvessels in rat brain. We found that 20 min 0.1-1 mA tDCS transiently increases P to a small solute, sodium fluorescein (MW 376) and to a large solute, Dextran-70k, with a much higher increase in P to the large solute. By pretreating the vessel with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, we revealed that the tDCS-induced increase in P is NO dependent. A transport model for the BBB was further employed to predict the structural changes by the tDCS. Comparing model predictions with the measured data suggests that tDCS increases P by temporarily disrupting the structural components forming the paracellular pathway of the BBB. That the transient and reversible increase in the BBB permeability also suggests new applications of tDCS such as a non-invasive approach for brain drug delivery through the BBB.",

        "abstract": "An exoskeleton robot helps the wearer with mechanical forces by identifying the wearer's intentions and requires high energy efficiency, sufficient load capacity, and a comfortable fit. However, since it is difficult to implement complex anatomical movements of the human body, most exoskeleton robots are designed simply, unlike the anatomy of real humans. This forces the wearer to accept the robot's stiffness entirely, and to use energy inefficiently from the power source. In this paper, a simple 1 degree of freedom (DoF) structure, which was mainly used in the knees of exoskeleton robots, was designed with a polycentric (multi-axial) structure to minimize the misalignment between wearer and robot, so that torque transfer could be carried out efficiently. In addition, the overall robot system was constructed by using an electro-hydraulic actuator (EHA) to solve the problems of the energy inefficiency of conventional hydraulic actuators and the low load capacity of conventional electric actuators. After the configuration of the hardware system, the sliding mode controller was designed to address the EHA nonlinear models and the uncertainty of the plant design. This was configured as Simulink for the first verification, and the experiment was conducted by applying it to the actual model to demonstrate the performance of the sliding mode control. In this process, an optical rotary encoder was used as the main feedback sensor of the controller. The proposed polycentric knee exoskeleton robot system using the EHA was able to reach the desired target value well despite the presence of many model uncertainties.",

Semen Cuscutae and Fructus Lycii (SC-FL) are well-known Chinese medicine which have been used to tonify the kidney and replenish the essence for thousands of years. Chinese physicians prefer to prescribe them for treating male infertility. Recent studies have found that SC-FL repair spermatogenic dysfunction, however, the therapeutic mechanism has yet to be clearly elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effect of SC-FL in glucosides of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f (GTW)-induced dyszoospermia rats and elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight Sprague-Dauley (SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal control (treated with saline), GTW (treated with saline), GTW + levocarnitine (treated with levocarnitine), GTW + SCFL (treated with SC-FL), and LY (LY294002, the PI3K inhibitor) +SCFL (treated with SC-FL). GTW (40 mg/kg/d) was intragastrically administered for 4 weeks to establish dyszoospermia model. From the start of the study, LY was additionally injected into the tail vein of rats of the LY + SCFL group once a week. After 8 weeks, semen quality and organ coefficient were determined and sex hormone, inhibin B, and epididymal carnitine levels were measured. Testicular tissue and its ultrastructure were observed using H&E (hematoxylin-eosin) staining and electron microscopy. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression of SCF, c-kit, PI3K, p-Akt, Bad, Bcl-2, and Bax in rat testis. RESULTS: Compared with the GTW group, semen quality, the organ coefficient, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), and epididymal carnitine levels were significantly improved in the GTW + SCFL group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Histomorphology and testicular ultrastructural evaluation showed that in the GTW + SCFL group, the structure and arrangement of seminiferous tubules were better, the amount of spermatogenic cells increased significantly, the morphology of spermatogenic cells improved, and the mitochondria increased, compared to those in the GTW group. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR results showed that compared with the GTW group, the expression of SCF, c-kit, PI3K, p-Akt, and Bcl-2 in the GTW + SCFL group was increased, while that of Bax and Bad was decreased. The expression of p-Akt and Bcl-2 decreased, while that of Bad and Bax increased in the LY + SCFL group compared with the SCFL group. CONCLUSION: SC-FL can effectively inhibit spermatogenic cell apoptosis and promote their proliferation, and the mechanism may be related to the regulation of the SCF/c-kit--PI3K--Bcl-2 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Yellow perch, Perca flavescens, is an ecologically and economically important species native to a large portion of the northern United States and southern Canada and is also a promising candidate species for aquaculture. However, no yellow perch reference genome has been available to facilitate improvements in both fisheries and aquaculture management practices. By combining Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-reads, 10X Genomics Illumina short linked reads and a chromosome contact map produced with Hi-C, we generated a high-continuity chromosome-scale yellow perch genome assembly of 877.4 Mb. It contains, in agreement with the known diploid chromosome yellow perch count, 24 chromosome-size scaffolds covering 98.8% of the complete assembly (N50 = 37.4 Mb, L50 = 11). We also provide a first characterization of the yellow perch sex determination locus that contains a male-specific duplicate of the anti-Mullerian hormone type II receptor gene (amhr2by) inserted at the proximal end of the Y chromosome (chromosome 9). Using this sex-specific information, we developed a simple PCR genotyping assay which accurately differentiates XY genetic males (amhr2by(+) ) from XX genetic females (amhr2by(-) ). Our high-quality genome assembly is an important genomic resource for future studies on yellow perch ecology, toxicology, fisheries and aquaculture research. In addition, characterization of the amhr2by gene as a candidate sex-determining gene in yellow perch provides a new example of the recurrent implication of the transforming growth factor beta pathway in fish sex determination, and highlights gene duplication as an important genomic mechanism for the emergence of new master sex determination genes.",

Four hour postoperative PTH monitoring predicts the need for calcium supplementation in the adult thyroidectomy population. We evaluated the role of the 4\u202fh postoperative PTH level in determining the need for calcium supplementation after thyroidectomy in the pediatric population. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of children undergoing total thyroidectomy by a single pediatric surgeon from July 2011 through July 2018. Intact PTH obtained four hours postoperatively determined the need for calcium supplementation for patients beginning in November 2014 onward. Serum total calcium levels were monitored concurrently with serum intact PTH levels. Serum calcium levels were followed in our Multispecialty Pediatric Endocrine Surgery clinic within the month following thyroidectomy. RESULTS: From July 2011 through July 2018, there were a total of 56 total thyroidectomies at our institution. Prior to November 2014, all pediatric total thyroidectomies received calcium supplementation per our institutional protocol. Based on ionized calcium levels, 26.3% (5/19) of children developed hypocalcemia. From November 2014 to July 2018, 37 pediatric patients required total thyroidectomies. 29.7% (11/37) had low 4-h postoperative PTH levels. 72.7% (8/11) patients with low 4-h postoperative PTH levels had corresponding postoperative day 1 total calcium levels less than 8.5 or ionized calcium levels less than 1.12, and five children (45.5%) developed symptomatic hypocalcemia. 70% (26/37) of children had normal 4-h postop PTH levels, with only 5 (19%) ever developing hypocalcemia. No patients with a normal postop PTH level developed symptomatic hypocalcemia or required IV calcium repletion. A single 4-h postoperative PTH <10\u202fpg/dl for identifying hypocalcemia has a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 91%, with AUC 0.81. CONCLUSION: The 4-h postoperative serum PTH level can help determine the need for calcium supplementation in pediatric patients undergoing total thyroidectomy, thereby reducing unnecessary calcium supplementation and serial lab draws to monitor for postoperative hypocalcemia.

It is of interest to see if a significant prediction concerning the sensitivity can be made by in vivo irradiation during radiation treatment. METHODS: Blood samples of 274 patients with rectal cancer and 43 lung cancer patients receiving radiotherapy were examined after 2 Gy ex vivo and in vivo ionizing radiation. Chromosomes # 1, 2 and 4 were stained by the 3-color-fluorescence in situ hybridization. Chromosomal aberrations were analyzed as breaks per metaphase (B/M). The deposited energy per session was calculated for each patient. RESULTS: Weak correlation could be found between the chromosomal aberrations ex and in vivo. Though receiving significantly smaller deposited energy during radiation therapy (RT) the lung cancer cohort displayed B/M values similar to the rectal cancer cohort. Considering the individual deposit energy differences improved slightly the correlation. CONCLUSIONS: As various factors influence the induction of chromosomal aberrations it seems not feasible to estimate individual radiosensitivity via in vivo irradiation. An ex vivo estimation of individual radiosensitivity should be preferred.",

The important contribution of tumor-suppressive (TS) microRNAs (miRs) in BC development and treatment have been well-acknowledged in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The present review focused on the contribution of recently examined TS miRs in the progression and treatment of various histological subtypes of BC. RESULTS: In summary, various miRs have tumor-suppressive roles in BC, so that their aberrant expression leads to the abnormality in the cellular processes such as enhanced cell growth, decreased apoptosis, cell migration and metastasis, and decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy through deregulated expression of oncogene targets of TS miRs. CONCLUSION: TS miRs could be regarded as a proper molecular target for target therapy of BC. However, further in vitro and in vivo investigations are required to confirm the exact molecular functions of TS miRs in BC cells to offer more efficient targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:  As our population ages, the demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) will dramatically increase to ensure an independent lifestyle with unimpeded and pain-free ambulation. Complications will be inevitable, especially in that patient with preexisting soft tissue deficits or extensive scarring in the knee region. Under these circumstances, prophylactic soft tissue augmentation should be strongly considered and be extremely beneficial. METHODS:  A retrospective review of all TKA procedures at our institutions over the past two decades revealed seven patients who specifically had soft tissue augmentation prior to their definitive TKA. Each had a single perforator flap used to achieve this. In no cases was a muscle flap used for this purpose. Excluded were all patients who had a flap of any kind for coverage of an exposed prosthesis or to accomplish wound healing after the TKA. RESULTS:  Seven perforator flaps were utilized in seven patients for soft tissue replacement prior to the ultimate TKA. For smaller defects in three patients, a local island medial sural artery perforator flap was used. For larger defects in four patients, an anterolateral thigh perforator free flap was necessary. All flaps were successful. The only complication was an implant infection after one anterolateral thigh free flap that required a revision arthroplasty that eventually allowed salvage. Unrestricted ambulation was possible in all patients except for one who had a preexisting contralateral below-knee amputation. CONCLUSION:  As the number of TKA procedures in the near future increases, prevention of the absolute number of complications becomes even more important. An awareness that any knee region suboptimal soft tissue base can lead to wound breakdown and then periprosthetic infection should alert all involved that prevention of this sequela can be best achieved by prior soft tissue augmentation. Preferably, this may be possible by capturing the assets of local and free perforator flaps.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we have investigated the tunability of the photoluminescence (PL) of the monolayer MoS(2) (1L-MoS(2)) by decorating it with WS(2) quantum dots (WS(2) QD). The direct bandgap 1L-MoS(2) and WS(2) QDs are grown by chemical vapor deposition and liquid exfoliation methods, respectively. The room temperature PL spectrum of bare 1L-MoS(2) is systematically quenched with its decoration with WS(2) QDs at different concentrations. A decrease in the work function of 1L-MoS(2) with the decoration of WS(2) QDs was established from the Kelvin probe force microscopy analysis. A detailed quantitative analysis using the four-energy level model involving coupled charge transfer was employed to explain the redshift and the systematic decrease in the intensity of the PL peak in 1L-MoS(2)/WS(2) QD heterostructure. The modulation of the PL in the heterostructure is attributed to the increase in the formation of negative trions through the charge transfer from WS(2) QD to the 1L-MoS(2) and thus making the 1L-MoS(2) heavily n-type doped, with increase in the electron density by ~1.5 x 10(13) cm(-2). This study establishes the contribution of defects in the coupled charge transfer dynamics in 1L-MoS(2), and it lays out a convenient strategy to manipulate the optical and electrical properties of 1L-MoS(2) for various optoelectronic applications.",

The results showed that FeCl(3) can be hydrolyzed easily, thus reducing the pH of the water and the residual iron in the water were not conducive to the removal of ammonium and manganese. Transforming the coagulant FeCl(3) into PFC can effectively recover the removal effect of ammonium and manganese. After being pre-treated by PAFC, removal of ammonium and manganese during the filtering operation remained stable and excellent. Simultaneously, the structural characteristics of the filter material were analyzed. Different coagulants caused different changes of shape of filter media. As FeCl(3) is a coagulant, the slow increase in specific surface area is not beneficial to removal of ammonium and manganese. Additionally, the results of FTIR spectra indicated that coagulants have different influences on the group of Fe-OH bonds of filter media. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study of the effects of water quality factors on the removal of ammonium and manganese from surface water.",

        "abstract": "There are heat transfer correlations for heat transfer analysis in single tube geometries after several experimental and theoretical heat transfer studies in these single tube geometries. This is not the case for heat transfer analysis in rod bundle geometry with regard to proposed square fuel assembly of the Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) European Atomic Energy (EURATOM) design. Thus limited heat transfer studies exist on rod bundle geometry at supercritical pressures. Heat transfer correlations with accurate prediction capabilities of coolant and wall temperatures will be helpful in carrying out heat transfer studies at supercritical pressures. This paper presents the performance of twelve selected heat transfer correlations assessed on the 1/8(th) bare square fuel assembly of the SCWR EURATOM design using Simulation of Turbulent flow in Arbitrary Regions Computational Continuum Mechanics C ++ based code (STAR-CCM + CFD code). The obtained numerical results were compared with the results obtained by Waata numerical experimentation. Overall, the Cheng et al. correlation provided the most satisfying prediction for the wall temperatures in all the sub-channels and captured closely Wataa's Numerical data. The maximum wall temperature was obtained in sub-channel 9, the hottest sub-channel and exceeded the design limit 620  degrees C by 60  degrees C for the Cheng correlation. The difference in temperature between the hottest and coldest sub-channels 9 and 1 respectively was approximately 80  degrees C. It was found that Cheng correlation is best suited for heat transfer prediction in rod bundle geometry at supercritical pressures with regard to the proposed square fuel assembly of the SCWR EURATOM design. It was also found that the different numerical tools adopted for this study and Waata study were able to capture the trends of normal, enhanced and deteriorated heat transfer regimes normally observed at supercritical pressures. Nevertheless, experimental investigations involving rod bundles adopted in this study should be conducted to validate the results obtained numerically and address the inconsistency of the conclusions drawn when compared with Waata data and other similar studies.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is characterized by an initial ischemia followed by a reperfusion that promotes cascade of damage referred to as primary injury. The loss of mitochondrial function after ischemia, which is characterized by oxidative stress and activation of apoptotic factors is considered to play a crucial role in the proliferation of secondary injury and subsequent brain neuronal cell death. Dopamine D2 receptor agonist, Ropinirole, has been found to promote neuroprotection in Parkinson s disease and restless leg syndrome. The current study was designed to test its efficacy in preclinical model of stroke. Previously it has been demonstrated that Ropinirole mediates its neuroprotection via mitochondrial pathways. Assuming this, we investigated the effect of Ropinirole on mitochondrial dysfunction, we have shown the positive effect of Ropinirole administration on behavioral deficits and mitochondrial health in an ischemic stroke injury model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Male Wistar rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and then received the Ropinirole (10 mg and 20 mg/kg b.w.) at 6 h, 12 and 18 h post occlusion. Behavioral assessment for functional deficits included grip strength, motor coordination and gait analysis. Our findings revealed a significant improvement with Ropinirole treatment in tMCAO animals. Staining of isolated brain slices from Ropinirole-treated rats with 2, 3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) showed a reduction in the infarct area in comparison to the vehicle group, indicating the presence of an increased number of viable mitochondria. Ropinirole treatment was also able to attenuate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as block the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), in the tMCAO injury model. In addition, it was also able to ameliorate the altered mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration ratio in the ischemic animals, thereby suggesting that Ropinirole has a positive effect on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Ropinirole inhibited the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol reduces the downstream apoptotic processes. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that Ropinirole treatment is beneficial in preserving the mitochondrial functions that are altered in cerebral ischemic injury and thus can help in defining better therapies.",

METHODS: This cohort study had an observational and retrospective design and included patients who received pneumococcal vaccines at a family medicine clinic in a medically underserved area in Southwestern Pennsylvania across a 42-month period from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2018. The outcome measures included the administration and appropriateness of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate (PCV13) and pneumococcal 23-valent polysaccharide (PPSV23) vaccines across 3 time cohorts including before, during, and after the establishment of a clinical pharmacy service. RESULTS: A total of 457 pneumococcal vaccines were administered, including 198 (43.3%) PCV13 and 259 (56.7%) PPSV23, across all time cohorts. Overall vaccine administration per month increased by 143% with the introduction of a dedicated clinical pharmacy service, including a 270% increase for PCV13 and an 87% increase for PPSV23. A strong correlation was found between recommendations made and doses administered for both pneumococcal vaccines (r = 0.89; P < 0.003). Across the entire time frame, PPSV23 administrations were appropriate in more than 96% of instances, whereas the appropriateness of PCV13 administrations were statistically significantly improved after the introduction of a fully dedicated clinical pharmacy service (58.5% vs. 90.8%; P < 0.05). The appropriateness of vaccine administration remained high even after the reduction of clinical pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Clinical pharmacy service implementation in a family medicine clinic was associated with increased pneumococcal vaccine administration and increased appropriateness of PCV13 administrations.",

We sought to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing FFR-guided revascularization according to the existence of DM and CMD. METHODS: A total of 283 patients with available FFR data as well as index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) were selected from the 3 V FFR-FRIENDS study. CMD was defined as an IMR >/=25U. Patients were grouped according to the presence of DM and CMD into group A (DM-, CMD-), group B (DM-, CMD+), group C (DM+, CMD-), and group D (DM+, CMD+). The primary outcome was a major adverse cardiac event (MACE, a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, and cardiac death) at 2 years. RESULTS: DM patients displayed a notably higher risk of MACEs in comparison with non-DM patients (HR 4.88, 95% CI 1.54-15.48, p\u202f=\u202f0.003). MACEs at 2 years among the four groups were 2.2%, 2.0%, 7.0%, and 18.5%, respectively. Group D exhibited a significantly higher risk of MACEs as compared to group A (HR 8.98, 95% CI 2.15-37.41, p\u202f=\u202f0.003). Multivariable regression analysis showed that the presence of DM and CMD was an independent predictor of a 2-year MACE (HR 11.24, 95% CI 2.53-49.88, p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and integrating CMD into a model with DM increased discriminant ability (C-index 0.683 vs. 0.710, p\u202f=\u202f0.010, integrated discrimination improvement 0.015, p\u202f=\u202f0.040).

The purpose of this article is to review the literature over the past 5 years, to describe current treatment of lichen sclerosus as it relates to urethral stricture in men. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature reviews were performed using PUBMED, with search terms \"lichen scleros*\" and \"urethral stenosis\", as well as \"lichen scleros*\" and \"urethral stricture\". Relevant articles published within the past 5 years were selected for review. A summary of current treatment of lichen sclerosus was prepared and synthesized. RESULTS: For LS affecting genital skin, topical steroids are a mainstay of therapy but in advanced cases, surgery may be required such as circumcision. When LS causes urethral stricture, urethral dilatation is unlikely to be successful long term, and surgery is often required, such as meatoplasty, single- or two-stage urethroplasty, or perineal urethrostomy. Oral mucosal grafting is the graft of choice, and usage of genital skin for flaps or grafts is best avoided due to predilection for recurrence. Biopsy and long-term surveillance of LS are recommended, due to its potential association with squamous cell carcinoma development. CONCLUSION: Although debate still exists regarding the pathogenesis of LS, it is agreed that LS can pose a treatment challenge to physicians and surgeons. Treatment options for LS range from pharmacological to surgical, depending on severity and location of disease, patient factors, and response of previous treatments.",

Although survey usage to evaluate practices in the equine community is not new, the use of social media to advertise and enhance the usage of Web-based surveys is novel. In 2018, the University of Minnesota (UMN) equine Extension program developed and administered two Web-based surveys through the UMN equine Extension Facebook page and monthly e-newsletter. Surveys focused on industry practices and motivating factors behind the usage of hay nets and methods to provide water in the winter to horses. Two thousand eighty-eight participants started the hay net survey with a completion rate of 96%, whereas the winter water survey had a completion rate of 94%, with 930 participants starting the survey. Participant demographics aligned with previous survey populations and represented all regions of the United States. Both surveys revealed information, which described current industry practices as well as future research needs. In addition, participants were asked if scientific research would impact future decision-making in regards to equine management. When exploring hay net practices, most participants responded \"maybe\" (48%, n = 527), whereas for the winter water survey, the majority responded \"yes\" (68%, n = 877). Web-based surveys administered through social media present multiple benefits, including savings of both cost and labor, compared with traditional mailed surveys. Despite the success observed with the present surveys, this methodology may not be suitable for organizations with limited social media followers.",

Multidrug resistant (MDR) TB patients have a reduced treatment success rates and for, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB the cure rate does not exceed 25% in many countries. To evaluate the pre-XDR-TB and XDR-TB prevalence and transmission in Rio Grande do Sul State, in southern Brazil, we performed a retrospective WGS-based analysis of 87 MDR-TB cases, aiming to identify resistance-conferring mutations and its phylogenetic distinctiveness. Using a five SNP threshold for genomic clustering, 60 strains were genomically linked within 10 clusters, including 14 likely transmission events identified by retrospective conventional epidemiological investigation. Moreover, five likely transmission events involved 17 patients deprived of liberty in the same prison establishment. Mutations associated with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance were identified respectively in 97.70% and 98.85% of MDR M.tb strains, more frequently in katG and rpoB genes. In total, we identified eight (9.19%) pre-XDR and four (4.59%) XDR M.tb strains. Resistance to ofloxacin was observed in seven (8.04%) strains, all of them presenting resistance-conferring mutations. Phenotypic resistance from capreomycin and kanamycin was found in seven (8.04%) and four (4.59%) strains respectively, but no classic mutations associated with resistance to these drugs was identified. The results put in evidence a scenario involving multiple phylogenetically distinctive clades associated with pre-XDR and XDR-TB in the largest state of southern Brazil, while stressing the potential of using WGS to predict anti-TB drug resistance and need to halt MDR-TB transmission in the region.",

The objective of our study is to quantify the association between type of neuraxial anesthetic and short-term neonatal morbidity among preeclamptic patients undergoing cesarean delivery. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study. Women with singleton gestations and a diagnosis of preeclampsia who underwent cesarean delivery with neuraxial anesthesia were included in the analysis. Short-term neonatal morbidities, defined as neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, arterial cord gas pH </=7.2 and 5-minute Apgar <7, were compared based on type of neuraxial anesthetic. RESULTS: A total of 4100 patients were included in the analysis, 1696 (41.4%) received spinal anesthesia 1848 (45.1%) received epidural anesthesia and 556 (13.5%) received a combined spinal-epidural (CSE). Antepartum and intrapartum characteristics significantly differed between the groups (p</=0.02). After adjusted analysis, spinal anesthesia was associated with reduced odds of NICU admission, compared with epidural or CSE (OR; 95% CI: 0.79; 0.63-0.98, 0.71; 0.53-0.94, respectively). Spinal anesthesia was also associated with lower odds of a 5-minute Apgar <7 compared with epidural anesthesia (OR 0.59; 95% CI; 0.43-0.83). We found no association between type of anesthesia and arterial cord pH </=7.2. In stratiifed analysis by gestational age, no association between the type of neuraxial anesthesia and neonatal outcomes was noted among term infants, but associations persisted in preterm infants. CONCLUSIONS: Among women with preeclampsia undergoing cesarean delivery, spinal anesthesia may be associated with reduced short-term neonatal morbidity in preterm infants, compared with epidural or CSE.",

The obtained copolymer was investigated by fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) analysis. The ring-opening polymerization process effected on rheological properties were studied. The graft of LA increased the apparent viscosity of CS-LA, and the loaded of MTX by redox reduced its apparent viscosity enormously. The load of MTX under the action of DTT decreased the apparent viscosity and moduli of CS-LA-MTX hydrogel. In dynamic oscillatory experiment, the package of MTX reduced the rigidity of CS-LA and damaged the gel structure of CS-LA. The antimicrobial ability of CS-LA against E. coli was processed by the inhibition zone and growth curves. The modification of LA raised the antibacterial activity of CS-LA. The cytotoxicity assay of CS-LA-MTX to prostate cancer cells (RM-1) was examined. The load of MTX within CS-LA-MTX greatly enhanced the cytotoxicity to RM-1 cells. In summary, CS-LA hydrogel may provide a new copolymer carrier for drug package in food and biomedical application.",

Introducing serpentine patterns for strain-sensing materials is a very effective method for enhancing stretchability with a quantified structural resistance through a simple, reliable, and facile approach. Here, we investigate serpentine-pattern effects in the electrical responses to biaxial stretching for percolative graphene-nanoparticle films. Graphene nanoplatelet films are applied to a stretchable substrate using a facile spray-coating technique, for a variety of serpentine pattern shapes, aspect ratios, pattern frequencies, and number of coatings. The electrical responses after applying biaxial stretching (x-axis and y-axis) are measured and analyzed for comparison. The serpentine patterns that would be suitable for stretchable electrodes, sensitive sensors, and highly stretchable sensors are then identified. This work demonstrates the advantage of using serpentine patterns for stretchable strain sensors and offers guidelines for selecting suitable pattern types for strain sensors in stretchable-electronics applications.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most common type of invasive cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. Correct staging of breast cancer is critical to the survival rate of the patients. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB), currently the gold standard technique for breast cancer staging, requires preoperative and intraoperative image guidance for noninvasive SLN identification and minimal surgical invasion. However, existing image guidance techniques suffer from a variety of limitations, such as ionizing radiation, high cost, and poor imaging depth. To address the clinical challenges, new methodology has to be developed. METHODS: We developed a photoacoustic (PA) imaging procedure for noninvasive and nonradioactive SLN identification and biopsy guidance enhanced with a clinically-approved lymphatic tracer, i.e., carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) suspension injection. RESULTS: In vivo experiments show that the proposed procedure could sensitively identify the SLN and provide high-contrast image guidance for fine-needle aspiration simulation. In addition, we demonstrated that CNPs have significantly better performance than other commonly-used contrast agents, such as methylene blue and indocyanine green. CONCLUSION: PA imaging technique using clinically-approved CNPs as the contrast agent is capable for noninvasive and nonradioactive SLN identification and high-contrast biopsy guidance, and should be considered as a new tool for assisting SLNB in breast cancer staging. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed CNPs-enhanced PA imaging technique provides a practical way for SLN identification and biopsy guidance for breast cancer patients and paves the way for clinical translation of PA SLN imaging.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers have limited potential for cure with traditional therapies. Preliminary results from a phase I study of everolimus and bevacizumab in advanced solid tumors showed it to be a promising combination. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival for everolimus and bevacizumab in recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer. Secondary objectives included evaluation of efficacy and safety. METHODS: In this open-label, single-institution, phase II trial, patients received everolimus 10 mg/day by mouth and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days on a 28-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or adverse event. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Median age was 60.5 years (range 28-82). Forty-six (92%) subjects had measurable disease. Thirteen (26%) (24% adjusted) were progression-free at 6 months (95% CI 16.67-42.71%). One patient had a complete response, while six had a partial response and 35 had stable disease as their best response. Patients with both platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease demonstrated responses, as did some prior bevacizumab exposure. There were two grade 4 and 31 grade 3 toxicities noted in 25 distinct patients. The most common reported toxicities included oral mucositis, fatigue, diarrhea, hypertension, pain, nausea and anorexia. Thirty-eight (76%) patients came off study because of disease progression. Unique molecular profiles were identified in long-term responders. CONCLUSIONS: Combining everolimus and bevacizumab does not distinctly improve response compared to bevacizumab alone, but further study of selected patients with alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathway may document benefit.",

Paediatric morbidity and mortality as well as child development disorders are significantly associated with maternal obesity. Particularly in the neurodevelopmental and psychiatric area, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in children of mothers with an increased body mass index (BMI), there is a high correlation with childhood cognitive disabilities, attention disorders, and diseases on the autistic spectrum. The ELGAN (Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn) study is a multicentre study which has been supported since 2000 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and whose objective is to research predictors for neonatal brain damage and neurological-cognitive sequelae in premature infants. The areas of focus are the connection between maternal overweight and obesity and pregnancy complications, APGAR scores and systemic inflammatory markers. In this overview, our aim is to summarise the work in this area and discuss it critically on the basis of current literature. We will examine the hypothesis whether maternal overweight and obesity in terms of a chronic inflammatory state is associated with neonatal inflammation which in turn is associated with an unfavourable development prognosis.",

The present study is an effort to investigate the prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador using the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool Retrospective version (ICAST-R). METHOD: A student sample (males\u202f=\u202f1579; females\u202f=\u202f1554) from the seven largest universities in Quito, Ecuador, completed the ICAST-R. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that 69.6 % of participants experienced child maltreatment. Physical abuse was reported by 47.6 % of respondents; this commonly involved being beaten by parents. Emotional maltreatment was reported by 53 % of the participants; mostly through insults by same-sex peers and parents. Sexual abuse was reported by 15.5 % of the participants. The most prevalent forms of sexual abuse included being coerced into touching another person's genitals, having their genitals touched by others, or having someone expose their genitals to them. Sexual abuse was more prevalent amongst females (males\u202f=\u202f12.9 %; females\u202f=\u202f18.1 %, OR\u202f=\u202f1.49; CI\u202f=\u202f1.22-1.81), and physical abuse was more prevalent amongst males (males\u202f=\u202f50.5 %; females\u202f=\u202f44.6 %, OR\u202f=\u202f0.79; CI\u202f=\u202f0.69-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows evidence of a high prevalence of child maltreatment in Ecuador. We also identify significant gender differences in the type of abuse experienced, and in the context in which this abuse takes place. These results are important given the negative consequences of child maltreatment. More research applying ICAST to different populations is recommended to further validate the present findings and facilitate international comparisons.",

        "abstract": "Injured neurons can initiate their own neurotoxin-induced repair mechanisms by expressing protective genes and activating specific intracellular signal transduction pathways. Although glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays a key role in the repair of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, whether there is high expression of GDNF in DA neurons at an early stage of injury has not yet been reported. In this study, neurotoxin-induced GDNF overexpression was detected for the first time in MES23.5 DA immortalized neuroblastoma (MES23.5 DA) cells soon after 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment. We also observed that the phosphorylation of Akt1, a member of the protein kinase B family, was increased. Further studies showed that activated Akt1 increased the phosphorylation of the protein phosphatase Eya1, which is a member of the eyes absent (Eya) family of transcriptional cofactors. Then, activated Eya1 decreased the phosphorylation of the sine oculis-related homeobox 2 (Six2) transcription factor. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) revealed that Six2 promoted GDNF transcription in MES23.5 DA cells by directly binding to the GDNF promoter. Finally, we showed that inhibiting neurotoxin-induced GDNF overexpression increased MES23.5 DA cell death, while promoting GDNF expression via Six2 overexpression decreased DA neuronal death. These results suggest that MES23.5 DA cells with early 6-OHDA-induced injury can promote the overexpression of GDNF by activating the Akt1/Eya1/Six2 signaling pathway, and this overexpression of GDNF has protective effects on injured MES23.5 DA cells. Hence, this study highlights a new target for drug development for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

The CXCL10 and SLC27A6 mRNA abundances were greater for normal cows compared to RB and RB + SE cows (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively) whereas ISG15 and SLC2A1 mRNA abundances were greater for normal cows compared to RB + SE (P < 0.05). The SLC27A6 mRNA abundances were greater for RB versus RB + SE (P < 0.01). Similarly, PPARD, PPARG, RXRA and RXRG mRNA abundances were greater for normal cows compared to RB and RB + SE (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Abundances of PPARD, PPARG, RXRA and RXRG mRNA were greater for RB versus RB + SE (P < 0.05) and MUC1 was lower in abundance in normal cows compared to RB or RB + SE (P < 0.05). Key predicted molecular functions were binding, signal transducer and transporter; key biological processes were cellular, localization and metabolic; key cellular components were cell part, membrane and organelle components; and key protein classes were nucleic acid binding, receptor, and transcription factors. Gene networking analysis highlighted interactions and pathways involving PAPRs, RXRs, and MUC1, notably among PPARD, PPARG, and MUC1. In conclusion, endometrial mRNA expressions of ISGs (CXCL10 and SLC27A6), PPAR isomers (PPARD and PPARG), and RXRs (RXRA and RXRG) were in lower abundances, whereas MUC1 expression was more abundant in RB or RB + SE compared to normal cows on day 16. In addition, ISG15 and SLC2A1 genes were less abundant in RB + SE versus RB or normal cows. Altered expression of these uterine genes and associated potential impairment in embryo elongation and implantation may promote embryonic loss in repeat breeder cows. Furthermore, interactions among PPARD, PPARG and MUC1 may be therapeutically exploitable.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key contributors to gene regulatory networks. Because miRNAs are processed from RNA polymerase II transcripts, insight into miRNA regulation requires a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of primary miRNA transcripts. We used Bru-seq nascent RNA sequencing and hidden Markov model segmentation to map primary miRNA transcription units (TUs) across 32 human cell lines, allowing us to describe TUs encompassing 1443 miRNAs from miRBase and 438 from MirGeneDB. We identified TUs for 61 miRNAs with an unknown CAGE TSS signal for MirGeneDB miRNAs. Many primary transcripts containing miRNA sequences failed to generate mature miRNAs, suggesting that miRNA biosynthesis is under both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. In addition to constitutive and cell-type specific TU expression regulated by differential promoter usage, miRNA synthesis can be regulated by transcription past polyadenylation sites (transcriptional read through) and promoter divergent transcription (PROMPTs). We identified 197 miRNA TUs with novel promoters, 97 with transcriptional read-throughs and 3 miRNA TUs that resemble PROMPTs in at least one cell line. The miRNA TU annotation data resource described here reveals a greater complexity in miRNA regulation than previously known and provides a framework for identifying cell-type specific differences in miRNA transcription in cancer and cell transition states.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To investigate whether dental anxiety influences the intraoperative pain felt by patients during root canal treatment. METHODOLOGY: In a cross-sectional design, 180 patients (90 men and 90 women) were included. Pre-operative anxiety levels were assessed using the short-form Dental Anxiety Inventory (S-DAI). Pain during root canal treatment was evaluated using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranked the level of pain between 'Absence of pain' and 'Unbearable pain'. The minimal sample size was determined using the software of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NIH, UK). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify relationships between variables. RESULTS: Mean pain level during root canal treatment was 2.2 +/- 2.1. The mean anxiety S-DAI score was 27.2 +/- 12.5. Fifty percent of men had mild anxiety levels, while in 70% of women anxiety was moderate or high (P = 0.017). Anxiety correlated positively with intraoperative pain (R = 0.406). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that anxiety was significantly associated with intraoperative pain felt by patients (OR = 4.0; 95% C.I. = 1.7-9.3; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Anxious patients were more than twice as likely to feel moderate or intense intraoperative pain during root canal treatment. To know the patient s degree of anxiety could help the dentist to decide whether to use anxiolytic premedication and/or supplemental local anaesthesia to assure better control of pain during root canal treatment.",

AIMS: To explore what work practice competencies entry-level occupational therapists require to meet the work-related needs of persons with disabilities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This exploratory qualitative research sought to explore what professional competencies entry-level occupational therapists required for them to offer collaborative inter-sectoral work practice initiatives for persons with disabilities within the Zimbabwean context. Six participants selected using criterion sampling, participated in semi-structured interviews. Inductive content analysis was conducted. The Stellenbosch Health Research Ethics Committee and Medical Rehabilitation Practitioner's Council of Zimbabwe gave ethical clearance and permissions to conduct the study. RESULTS: Three themes; core knowledge for work practice, skills for work practice and occupational therapy professional attributes; emerged. These were used in formulation of ten professional competency statements for occupational therapists offering work practice services. CONCLUSIONS: Although Zimbabwean occupational therapists require similar competencies for work practice as those required in other countries, additional competencies that fall outside traditional health care contexts are essential in order to promote contextually relevant practice.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Women with human immunodeficiency virus have higher rates of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology and, subsequently, of cervical and vaginal cancers. Although professional bodies currently advocate for indefinite cytology screening for women living with human immunodeficiency virus, these recommendations are based on expert opinion, not evidence-based. In the general population, women who have never had an abnormal cytology result can cease screening at age 65 years. This is due to the relatively low incidence of dysplasia in this group and the risk of false-positive results as women age, invasive follow-up testing, and destructive treatments of lesions that are unlikely to progress to cancer. What is unclear, however, is how human immunodeficiency virus-infected women over age 65 years who have no history of abnormal cytology should be screened to maximize benefit while reducing harms of overscreening. This is a crucial question, as women over age 65 years who are living with human immunodeficiency virus comprise a rapidly growing population. OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology results in women over the age of 65 years living with human immunodeficiency virus, with the goal of providing evidence for screening recommendations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed, identifying 69 women who received gynecologic follow-up in a county hospital system in Houston, Texas, between 2000 and 2018 and who met study criteria. Incidence of abnormal cytology after age 65 was determined by analyzing all available cytology results after age 65. Demographic and clinical risk factors, including human immunodeficiency virus-specific clinical risk factors, were analyzed. Matched cervical and vaginal pathology results, if conducted, were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 15, including chi(2) tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Estimates of the cumulative probability of developing an abnormal cytology result was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Among 69 women with no history of abnormal cervical cytology, 12 (17%) went on to develop abnormal cytology results, including 3 (4%) showing high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. The incidence rate was 3.5 cases per 100 woman-years (95% confidence interval, 1.58, 7.81). No demographic or gynecologic characteristics were associated with abnormal cytology. A CD4 count of <200 at the time of human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis or at the time of cytology was associated with an abnormal Papanicolaou test result (P < .0001, P = .031). Of women with pathology results in the county hospital system (n = 8), 4 (50%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 2+. No women developed invasive cancer. However, 50% of women who had an abnormal Papanicolaou test result in the study period were lost to follow-up; outcomes for these patients are unknown. CONCLUSION: Given the relatively high proportion (4%) of women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions/cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ during the study period, we agree with current screening recommendations for continued routine Papanicolaou testing after the age of 65 years in women with human immunodeficiency virus. More evidence from larger studies is needed to solidify evidence-based screening recommendations in this unique and growing population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to identify and describe key components of research into the teaching methods of public health to postgraduate students. STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review of the published literature. METHODS: A detailed search of the literature based on keywords, Boolean operators, and free-text terms, identified from PubMed, Scopus and ERIC, published in the English language, between January 2000 and December 2017, was made. Teams of independent pairs agreed studies eligible for the review and performed data extraction. RESULTS: Of the 2,442 potential studies on education of public health professionals, 86 met all the inclusion criteria. Specific study designs, data collection, and techniques for data analysis varied widely across the individual studies, and there was a lack of consistency on the whole. The number of students in each study ranged from ten to 1,300. Forty-seven studies used quantitative methods to assess the effectiveness of teaching. Curriculum evaluation was the most common focus (n = 33), followed by course evaluation (n = 22). Few studies considered inequalities in terms of the types of students registered on the different courses/programs, with just three evaluating strategies to increase students from minority ethnic groups. Most studies evaluated short-term or medium-term outcomes rather than long-term impacts of education on students' careers or the relationship of education in meeting future public health workforce demands. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive systematic review identified a dearth of the literature on evaluations of approaches for teaching public health to health professions students. Those studies that had been published varied to such an extent in terms of their aims, methods, analysis, and results such that it was impossible to make any consistent comparisons of the observations reported in the studies. We conclude that evidence-based approaches for teaching public health to health professions students are either not sought by faculty and programs or, if conducted, not shared. As such, there are likely to be missed opportunities for ensuring that future graduates of health professions programs are as well prepared as possible to contribute to the health of the public.",

        "abstract": "The identification of mutually exclusive somatic mutations shared among myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) subtypes has provided a powerful tool for studying disease evolution. Clinical features, gene mutations, and survival over 18 years were analyzed in MPN patients. One hundred thirty-eight MPN patients were subcategorized according to MPN subtypes: essential thrombocythemia (ET, n = 41), polycythemia vera (PV, n = 56), primary myelofibrosis (PMF, n = 10), and MPN unclassified (MPN-U, n = 31). Patient characteristics included clinical parameters, overall survival (OS), and mutational status of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) genes. We compared hematologic and clinical features of JAK2V617F-ET vs. CALR-mutated ET vs. JAK2V617F-PV patients. JAK2V617F-patients had higher values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit compared to CALR-mutated patients (p < 0.05). The mutant allele burden in JAK2V617F-PV and JAK2V617F-ET patients directly correlated with erythrocyte, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values, but it inversely correlated with platelet count. Thus, mutant allele burden was an indicator of the clinical phenotype in JAK2V617F-MPN patients. OS was not affected by the mutational status. In general, mutated JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes left specific hematological signatures.",

        "abstract": "During pregnancy, the procoagulant activity increases (manifested by elevation in factor VII, factor VIII, factor X, and fibrinogen levels), while the anticoagulant activity decreases (characterized by reduction in fibrinolysis and protein S activity), resulting in hypercoagulation. Standard coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time, are still used despite the lack of evidence supporting its accuracy in evaluating the coagulation status of pregnant women. Thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry, which are used to assess the function of platelets, soluble coagulation factors, fibrinogen, and fibrinolysis, can replace standard coagulation tests. Platelet count and function and the effect of anticoagulant treatment should be assessed to determine the risk of hematoma associated with regional anesthesia. Moreover, anesthesiologists should monitor patients for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and attention should be paid when performing rapid coagulation tests, transfusions, and prohemostatic pharmacotherapy. Transfusion of a high ratio of plasma and platelets to red blood cells (RBCs) showed high hemostasis success and low bleeding-related mortality rates in patients with severe trauma. However, the effects of high ratios of plasma and platelets and the ratio of plasma to RBCs and platelets to RBCs in the treatment of massive PPH were not established. Intravenous tranexamic acid should be administered immediately after the onset of postpartum bleeding. Pre-emptive treatment with fibrinogen for PPH is not effective in reducing bleeding. If fibrinogen levels of less than 2 g/L are identified, 2-4 g of fibrinogen or 5-10 ml/kg cryoprecipitate should be administered.",

In the last decades, increasing targeted therapeutic options dramatically improved RA management by doubling the rate of patients achieving clinical remission. Currently, there is a need for management strategies aimed at limiting treatment-related adverse events and costs in good responders.Areas covered: Data on de-escalation of biologic drugs (especially for anti-TNF agents) are mainly available from post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and from registry-based observational studies. This narrative review illustrates the rationales for dose tapering and expands to provide an overview of the efficacy of the different available strategies for reducing the exposure to biologic drugs in patients achieving a sustained clinical response. Selected studies are discussed as illustrative examples.Expert opinion: Withdrawal of biologic therapy might be attempted in limited patients with very early RA; conversely, established RA is more suitably managed with a progressive decrease of drug regimen, by either dose reduction or injection/infusion spacing. Further studies investigating potential factors predicting post-tapering disease relapse are warranted, in order to better identify the best candidates for a decreased-dose approach.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For all doctors, including occupational physicians (OPs), research and teaching are considered core requirements of medical education and continuing professional development. Academic skills are also vital to evidence-based practice and advancement of occupational health (OH) as a specialty. In recent years, attention has focussed on the declining UK OH academic base and the research- practice gap, and increased practitioner participation in research is encouraged. AIMS: To establish a baseline of research and teaching activity among UK OPs, identify related barriers and inform strategies to overcome them. METHODS: An online survey including specific career profile questions derived from consensus following expert panel discussions. It formed part of a larger Delphi study on UK OH research priorities. RESULTS: We received 213 responses, about 18% of 1207 practising UK OPs. Of these, 162 (76%) undertook research at some career-point, of which 44 (27%) were currently research-active. Similarly, 154 (72%) undertook teaching at some career-point, of which 99 (64%) were currently teaching-active. Of those who had never undertaken research (n = 51) or teaching (n = 59), 40 and 42% were interested in doing so, respectively. Key barriers were lack of time and opportunity, the former particularly for respondents practising in industry, where 'commercial' demands take priority, rather than healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a benchmark of academic activity among UK OPs and identifies related barriers. These 'target' barriers can shape research funding priorities and education to increase participation and develop the UK OH academic base.",

However, the Hetang Formation also hosts a number of problematic animal fossils that have not been systematically described. This omission results in an incomplete picture of the Hetang biota and limits its contribution to the understanding of the early evolution of animals. Here we describe a new animal taxon, Cambrowania ovata Tang and Xiao, new genus new species, from the middle Hetang Formation in the Lantian area of southern Anhui Province, South China. Specimens are preserved as carbonaceous compressions, although some are secondarily mineralized. A comprehensive analysis using reflected light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and micro-CT reveals that the new species is characterized by a spheroidal to fusoidal truss-like structure consisting of rafter-like crossbars, some of which are secondarily baritized and may have been internally hollow. Some specimens have aperture-like structures that are broadly similar to oscula of sponges, whereas others show evidence of a medial split reminiscent of gaping carapaces. While the phylogenetic affinity of Cambrowania ovata Tang and Xiao, new genus new species remains problematic, we propose that it may represent carapaces of bivalved arthropods or more likely sponges in early life stages. Along with other problematic metazoan fossils such as hyolithids and sphenothallids, Cambrowania ovata Tang and Xiao, new genus new species adds to the diversity of the sponge-dominated Hetang biota in an early Cambrian deep-water slope-basinal environment.",

However, the mechanical stability of this complex has yet to be quantified. Here, we directly quantified the mechanical stability of the alpha-catenin/beta-catenin complex and showed that it has enough mechanical stability to survive for tens to hundreds of seconds within physiological level of forces up to 10 pN. Phosphorylation or phosphotyrosine-mimetic mutations (Y142E or/and T120E) on beta-catenin shorten the mechanical lifetime of the complex by tens of fold over the same force range. These results provide insights into the regulation of the alpha-catenin/beta-catenin complex by phosphorylation.",

Here, we describe a novel approach to enhance canal formation in these animals by deleting a single allele of the gene encoding the phosphatase PTPRB during development. Compared to Tek haploinsufficient mice, which exhibit elevated IOP and loss of retinal ganglion cells, Tek(+/-);Ptprb(+/-) mice have elevated TEK phosphorylation, which allows normal SC development and prevents ocular hypertension and RGC loss.

Although TME after chemoradiotherapy remains the gold standard for locally advanced mid and low rectal cancer, in the last years multicenter research trials have offered encouraging oncologic results which have allowed to preserve the rectum in patients with a pathologic complete response after chemoradiotherapy. A review of the available literature on this topic was conducted to define the state of the art of this conservative approach and to focus on the most controversial aspects concerning local excision performed after chemoradiotherapy, in particular tumor scatter and lymph node status, completion and salvage surgery, morbidity and quality of life. The analysis of these topics should be considered, in trial setting or in current practice, for their clinical implications. Oncologic outcomes of recent trials are encouraging for part of the patients presenting T2 rectal cancer; however, TME still remains the standard treatment in clinical practice. In such cases, local excision should include a surgical safety margin of at least 1 cm from the resection margin to achieve a true negative margin from residual tumor cells. The selection of the patients should be carefully performed and their consensus extremely detailed because TME is necessary in about 30% of cases. Failing that, morbidity and quality of life are negatively affected. However, about half of these patients refuse radical surgery (45%), thus undergoing only palliative care.",

We found disease-model and stage-specific alterations and discovered a core disease-associated astrocyte molecular signature comprising 62 genes that were conserved between mice and humans. Our results show little evidence of neurotoxic A1 astrocytes that have been proposed to be causal for neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders such as HD. Furthermore, 61 of the 62-core gene expression changes within astrocytes were reversed in a HD mouse model by lowering astrocyte mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) expression using zinc finger protein (ZFP) transcriptional repressors. Our findings indicate that HD astrocytes progressively lose essential normal functions, some of which can be remedied by lowering mHTT. The data have implications for neurodegenerative disease rescue and repair strategies as well as specific therapeutic relevance for mHTT reduction and contribute to a better understanding of fundamental astrocyte biology and its contributions to disease.",

AIMS: This study explored the perspectives of medical faculty and students at a college in Saudi Arabia on the language of instruction in medical education. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of undergraduate medical students and full-time faculty members at a medical college in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was conducted in 2016. Each participant completed a self-administered, validated 28-item questionnaire. RESULTS: The total number of students and faculty who responded were 468 (76%) and 37 (93%) respectively. Most students and faculty members agreed that studying in English enables a better access to medical information (n=457, 91%) and more job opportunities (n=419, 83%). Less than 15% of the students preferred to be taught in Arabic in most of the curriculum aspects except for communication skills (n=131, 28%) and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) (n=119, 26%). CONCLUSIONS: Most medical students and faculty members preferred English as the language of instruction for medical education and did not believe that teaching medicine in Arabic should be sought as a future goal.",

        "abstract": "Wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) is a phenomenon that occurs in adult mammalian skin, where fully functional hair follicles are regenerated in the center of large full-thickness excisional wounds. Although originally discovered over 50 years ago in mice and rabbits, within the last decade it has received renewed interest, as the molecular mechanism has begun to be defined. This de novo regeneration of hair follicles largely recapitulates embryonic hair development, requiring canonical Wnt signaling in the epidermis, however, important differences between the two are beginning to come to light. TLR3 mediated double stranded RNA sensing is critical for the regeneration, activating retinoic acid signaling following wounding. Inflammatory cells, including Fgf9-producing gamma-delta T cells and macrophages, are also emerging as important mediators of WIHN. Additionally, while dispensable in embryonic hair follicle development, Shh signaling plays a major role in WIHN and may be able to redirect cells fated to scarring wounds into a regenerative phenotype. The cellular basis of WIHN is also becoming clearer, with increasing evidence suggesting an incredible level of cellular plasticity. Multiple stem cell populations, along with lineage switching of differentiated cells all contribute towards the regeneration present in WIHN. Further study of WIHN will uncover key steps in mammalian development and regeneration, potentially leading to new clinical treatments for hair-related disorders or fibrotic scarring.",

To date, large levels of non-reciprocity have been realized using broken spatial or temporal symmetries, yet mostly in the vicinity of resonances, bandgaps or using nonlinearities, thereby non-reciprocal transmission remains limited to narrow ranges of frequencies or input magnitudes and sensitive to attenuation. Here, we create a robotic mechanical metamaterials wherein we use local control loops to break reciprocity at the level of the interactions between the unit cells. We show theoretically and experimentally that first-of-their-kind spatially asymmetric standing waves at all frequencies and unidirectionally amplified propagating waves emerge. These findings realize the mechanical analogue of the non-Hermitian skin effect. They significantly advance the field of active metamaterials for non hermitian physics and open avenues to channel mechanical energy in unprecedented ways.",

The aim of this study is to estimate the realistic possibility to achieve the WHO elimination targets in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Polish population was established according to data from Statistics Poland for the year 2017. Treatment efficacy was estimated based on publications in time-frames depending on the availability of therapeutic options in Poland. The mortality of HCV-infected patients was assumed on the basis of Statistics Poland and the EpiTer-2 database The number of annual antiviral treatments was estimated based on data from the National Health Fund. Two scenarios were considered, without and with intervention dependent on the national screening program. RESULTS: The current diagnosis rate in Poland was calculated as 31%. The scenario without intervention resulted in gradual reduction of annual treatments accompanied by a decrease in the number of infected patients in 2030 to 118 000 (0.31% of the current Polish population), which is only 38% compared with 2015 established as a baseline by WHO. Introduction of the HCV screening program, which includes 3 million people annually, would increase treatment uptake to 12 000 per year and reduce the number of HCV-infected persons in Poland by 90%. CONCLUSIONS: The urgent implementation of the national screening program for HCV in Poland is essential to achieve the WHO goal by 2030. The screening strategy should include up to 3 million persons annually to achieve treatment uptake of 12 thousand patients per year.",

We aimed to compare complex characteristics, such as cell morphology, proliferative activity, differentiation potential, and especially monolayer recovery, DNA integrity, and the gene expression pattern, between AT-MSCs cultured with HPL or FCS. Primary AT-MSC cultures were expanded in medium containing FCS or pooled HPL. Cell growth and proliferation were estimated by cell doubling time and the monolayer formation rate, while migration was assessed by wound-healing assay. The capacity for adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase and Oil Red O staining. DNA integrity was evaluated by comet assay, and analysis of gene expression by real-time PCR. Media supplemented with HPL or FCS provided a similar surface immunophenotype, cell morphology (except some cell dimensions and a bigger colony size in HPL), DNA integrity, and rate of wound healing. Meanwhile, AT-MSC proliferated more intensively in HPL-supplemented media (especially at 5% HPL) and had a reduced doubling population time. AT-MSC in HPL had increased adipogenic potential and similar osteogenic potential in comparison with FCS. Our results indicate the feasibility and evident prospects for the use of pooled HPL as an alternative to FCS and safe non-xenogenic growth supplement for ex vivo expansion of clinical-grade AT-MSCs for regenerative medicine purposes.",

        "abstract": "The incorporation of fluorine has been shown to improve the biophysical and bioactive properties of several organic compounds. However, sustainable strategies of fluorination are needed. Fluorinases have the unique ability to catalyse a C-F bond, hence, have vast potential to be applied as biocatalysts in the preparation of fine chemicals. But fluorinases are extremely rare in nature with only five representatives isolated thus far. Moreover, the heterologous expression of fluorinases is challenged by low yields of soluble protein. This study describes the identification of a fluorinase from Actinopolyspora mzabensis. Overexpression of the Am-fluorinase in E. coli BL21 (DE3) resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs). The enzyme was recovered from IBs, solubilised in 8\u202fM urea, and successfully refolded into a biologically active form. Following hydrophobic interaction chromatography, >80\u202fmg of the active fluorinase was obtained at a purity suitable for biocatalytic applications. An additional gel filtration step gave >/=95% pure Am-fluorinase. Using LC-MS/MS, the optimal pH for activity was found at 7.2 while the optimal temperature was 65\u202f degrees C. At these conditions, the enzyme exhibited an activity of 0.44\u202f+/-\u202f0.03\u202fmuM\u202fmin(-1) mg(-1). Furthermore, the Am-fluorinase showed exceptional stability at 25\u202f degrees C. Preliminary results suggest that the newly identified Am-fluorinase is relatively thermostable.",

        "abstract": "The intensive development and commercialization of genetically modified plants observed over the last decade has led to the development of transgenic detection methods that are rapid and sensitive. Among the strategies used for the detection/monitoring of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) meets the necessary criteria. This optical technique measures the changes in the refractive index in the vicinity of thin metal layers (i.e., gold) in response to biomolecular interactions occurring at a flat metal\u2012solution interface. Additionally, it allows the application of functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in SPR research to enhance the signal intensity. In the present study, an SPR method, enhanced by the application of AuNPs, was developed to detect transgenic tobacco plants carrying a Streptococcus mutans antigen. The basis for the detection of the target DNA was the hybridization between the genomic DNA isolated from the leaves, stems, and roots of the transgenic tobacco and the biotinylated oligonucleotide probes immobilized onto a streptavidin (SA) sensor chip. SA-functionalized AuNPs coated with a second type of biotinylated probe were applied to increase the sensitivity of the detection method. Analysis of the results indicated that the constructed SPR-based sensor chip can potentially recognize complementary standard fragments (nonamplified genomic DNA) at concentrations as low as 1 pM. Thus, nonamplified transgenic DNA was detected using a label-free and real-time AuNPs-enhanced SPR biosensing method. This unique approach could be used to detect GMOs with high efficiency, even at a low detection limit, high repeatability, and with less time and a lower cost needed for each analysis.",

To investigate the link between CEL expression of breast cancer (BC) tissues and the survival of BC patients by analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) level 3 data. METHODS: The clinical information and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) expression data were downloaded from TCGA. Patients were divided into a high CEL expression group and a low CEL expression group using the optimal cutoff value (5.611) identified from the ROC curve. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to find the correlation between the expression of CEL and clinicopathologic features. To assess the diagnostic capability, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of CEL was drawn. The survival differences between high and low CEL expression groups were compared by Cox regression analysis. Log-rank test was applied to the calculation of p values and the comparison of the Kaplan-Meier curves. Furthermore, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used for external data validation. RESULTS: Analysis of 1104 cases of tumor data showed that CEL was over-expressed in breast cancer. There were relationships between high CEL expression and clinicopathologic features. The high CEL expression group had a lower survival. By analyzing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CEL, it was found to have a limited diagnostic capability. CEL expression may be an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer survival through the multivariate analysis. The validation in GEO datasets also showed that CEL expression was higher in breast tumor tissues than in normal breast tissues. High CEL expression was associated with the poor overall survival of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: High CEL expression may be an independent prognostic factor for the poor survival of breast cancer.",

The initial headspace-to-ambient-pressure ratio much exceeded the critical ratio needed for the gas mixture to reach Mach 1, thus forming under-expanded supersonic CO(2) freezing jets expelled from the throat of the bottlenecks. It was emphasized that, after adiabatic cooling and with a saturation ratio for gas-phase CO(2) about twice higher for the bottles stored at 30 degrees C, dry ice CO(2) clusters grow bigger and reach the critical size needed to achieve the Mie scattering of light. Moreover, during the very first millisecond following cork popping, evanescent normal shock waves (or Mach disks) were unveiled in the jets, until the reservoir-to-ambient-pressure ratio goes below a critical ratio.",

        "abstract": "AGAMOUS/SEEDSTICK (AG/STK) subfamily genes play crucial roles in the reproductive development of plants. However, most of our current knowledge of AG/STK subfamily genes is restricted to core eudicots and grasses, and the knowledge of ancestral exon-intron structures, expression patterns, protein-protein interaction patterns and functions of AG/STK subfamily genes remains unclear. To determine these, we isolated AG/STK subfamily genes (MawuAG1, MawuAG2 and MawuSTK) from a woody basal angiosperm Magnolia wufengensis (Magnoliaceae). MawuSTK arose from the gene duplication event occurring before the diversification of extant angiosperms, and MawuAG1 and MawuAG2 may result from a gene duplication event occurring before the divergence of Magnoliaceae and Lauraceae. Gene duplication led to apparent diversification in their expression and interaction patterns. It revealed that expression in both stamens and carpels likely represents the ancestral expression profiles of AG lineage genes, and expression of STK-like genes in stamens may have been lost soon after the appearance of the STK lineage. Moreover, AG/STK subfamily proteins may have immediately established interactions with the SEPALLATA (SEP) subfamily proteins following the emergence of the SEP subfamily; however, their interactions with the APETALA1/FRUITFULL subfamily proteins or themselves differ from those found in monocots and basal and core eudicots. MawuAG1 plays highly conserved roles in the determinacy of stamen, carpel and ovule identity, while gene duplication contributed to the functional diversification of MawuAG2 and MawuSTK. In addition, we investigated the evolutionary history of exon-intron structural changes of the AG/STK subfamily, and a novel splice-acceptor mode (GUU-AU) and the convergent evolution of N-terminal extension in the euAG and PLE subclades were revealed for the first time. These results further advance our understanding of ancestral AG/STK subfamily genes in terms of phylogeny, exon-intron structures, expression and interaction patterns, and functions, and provide strong evidence for the significance of gene duplication in the expansion and evolution of the AG/STK subfamily.",

        "abstract": "Sarcopenia is defined as the combined loss of skeletal muscle strength, function, and/or mass with aging. This degenerative loss of muscle mass is associated with poor quality of life and early mortality humans. The loss of muscle mass occurs due to acute changes in daily muscle net protein balance (NPB). It is generally believed a poor NPB occurs due to reduced muscle protein synthetic responses to exercise, dietary amino acid availability, or an insensitivity of insulin to suppress breakdown. Hence, aging muscles appear to be resistant to the anabolic action of exercise and protein (amino acids or hormonal) when compared to their younger counterparts. The mechanisms that underpin anabolic resistance to anabolic stimuli (protein and resistance exercise) are multifactorial and may be partly driven by poor lifestyle choices (increased sedentary time and reduced dietary protein intake) as well as an inherent dysregulated mechanism in old muscles irrespective of the environmental stimuli. The insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), Akt /Protein Kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is the primary driver between mechanical contraction and protein synthesis and may be a site of dysregulation between old and younger people. Therefore, our review aims to describe and summarize the differences seen in older muscle in this pathway in response to resistance exercise (RE) and describe approaches that researchers have sought out to maximize the response in muscle. Furthermore, this review will present the hypothesis that inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) may be implicated in IGF-1 signaling and thus sarcopenia, based on recent evidence that IGF-1 and insulin share some intracellular bound signaling events and that IP6K1 has been implicated in skeletal muscle insulin resistance.",

In addition to current therapeutic strategies, a lot of work is being done on nutraceutical management of this condition. This study was designed to assess the effect of date seed powder on lipid profile of diet induced hyperlipidemic rabbits. METHODS: Thirty male rabbits were divided into five groups, having six animals in each. One group was given normal rabbit chow throughout the study period of eight weeks. The remaining four groups were fed high fat diet (4% coconut oil and 1% cholesterol powder) for first four weeks in order to induce hyperlipidemia. After first four weeks, 2% date seed powder of three Pakistani varieties namely Dhakki, Khudrawi and Desi was added to the diet of three experimental hyperlipidemic groups for the next four weeks. Body weight and blood samples were taken at zero, 4th and 8th week of study. Serum was analyzed for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides. LDL/HDL ratio and AIP were calculated. RESULTS: It was observed that date seed powder of the three varieties significantly decreased total cholesterol, serum triglycerides and AIP. There was no significant change in body weight, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL/HDL ratio. LDL cholesterol was decreased significantly only by Khudrawi date seed powder. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that date seed powder has marked antihyperlipidemic properties. However, the difference in appearance, taste and price of different dates does not affect their lipid lowering capacity.",

About 140 (85%) immunization procedures against Abeta deposition and 25 (15%) against Tau have been reported, but no Food and Drug Administration approval of any AD vaccine has been achieved. This might be attributed to deficient pathogenic targets, inappropriate models, defective immunotherapeutic procedures, and inadequate clinical trial design.Areas covered: The issues covered include the following: AD pathogenic mechanisms, rationale for active and passive immunization, vaccine targets, anti-Abeta/Tau vaccines, vaccine technologies, animal models, and clinical trials.Expert opinion: A vaccine against AD is technically feasible; however, important methodological aspects should be changed for a tentative clinical success, including (i) the development of multitarget AD immunotherapies; (ii) the optimization of antibody titers and epitopes; (iii) the pharmacogenetic/pharmacoepigenetic validation of the immunization procedure; (iv) the prophylactic treatment of genetically stratified patients at a pre-symptomatic stage; and (v) the definition of primary endpoints in prevention, based on objective/multifactorial biomarkers. Even with exquisite protocols, a successful vaccine would be potentially useful in at most 20-30% of defined cases, according to the genetic, epigenetic, and pharmacogenetic background of AD patients.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The presence of keratinized mucosa (KM) around natural teeth is believed to be beneficial in certain restorative, prosthetic, and orthodontic situations. Lack of adequate KM is common and predictably treated by autogenous gingival grafts (AGGs); however, AGGs have the disadvantages of harvest site morbidity, limited donor site availability, and compromised esthetics. CASE PRESENTATION: This case series presents the use of the xenogeneic porcine bilayer collagen matrix (BCM) in increasing the width of attached KM around natural teeth. Patients with a limited amount of KM, shallow vestibule, and aberrant frenum attachment were treated using this graft material. The patients were followed up to 4.5 years postoperatively and were evaluated regarding the amount of KM, gingival margin stability, and tissue esthetics. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the sample size of patients in this report, the BCM appears to be a viable alternative option to AGG for increasing the width of KM gingiva around teeth. This method resulted in gain of KM, gingival margin stability, vestibular deepening, aberrant frenum elimination, and favorable esthetics in terms of color matching, texture, and contour blending. This xenogeneic graft material could be used in cases where the autogenous graft supply is limited or in highly esthetically demanding cases. Additionally, it could be an alternative option when a second surgical site is not desired by the patient or a less invasive procedure is preferred by the clinician in certain medical conditions. Well-controlled long-term studies are required to validate our limited clinical observations.",

While such approaches provide an avenue to reproduce structural correlations, thermodynamic quantities such as the pressure have typically not been considered in self-assembly applications. In this work, we demonstrate that relative entropy optimization can be used to discover potentials that self-assemble into targeted cluster morphologies with a prescribed pressure when the iterative simulations are performed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. The benefits of this approach are twofold. First, the structure and the thermodynamics associated with the optimized interaction can be controlled simultaneously. Second, by varying the pressure in the optimization, a family of interparticle potentials that all self-assemble the same structure can be systematically discovered, allowing for a deeper understanding of self-assembly of a given target structure and providing multiple assembly routes for its realization. Selecting an appropriate simulation ensemble to control the thermodynamic properties of interest is a general design strategy that could also be used to discover interaction potentials that self-assemble structures having, for example, a specified chemical potential.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line was cultured in a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle aqueous solution with a concentration of 1\u202fmug/mL by using magnetic labeling technology. The cells took up superparamagnetic nanoparticles through the endocytosis process, which caused the cells to become magnetic and manipulable by a magnetic field gradient. Each cell contained 5.266\u202fx\u202f10(6) superparamagnetic nanoparticles, as determined using the magnetophoresis method. A specific domain configuration and its related distribution of magnetic poles in a patterned thin film were obtained after applying a magnetic field in a specific direction. Here, patterned magnetic thin films were designed to form square grid and square ring structures. When the magnetic field of 3000\u202fG was applied along the diagonal of the square (45 degrees direction) and then released, magnetic cells were trapped at the intersection of the square grid and the 45 degrees  diagonal corner of the square ring structure. From micromagnetic simulation results, it was determined that head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls with a high magnetic pole density formed at the corners of the square ring structure in the 45 degrees  diagonal direction, and the attractive force between a head-to-head/tail-to-tail domain wall and a cell at a height of 1\u202fmum above the corner was approximately 2.055\u202fx\u202f10(-10)\u202fN. In the square grid case, the attractive force between the domain wall at the intersection and a cell at a height of 1\u202fmum above the intersection was approximately 2.245\u202fx\u202f10(-10)\u202fN. The results of this study demonstrated that cells can simultaneously be arranged at designated locations physically by using patterned magnetic thin films in a noninvasive manner without chemical modification of the substrate.",

Analyses of conformational ensembles of circular DNA (circDNA) and RNA (circRNA) molecules of different lengths and sequences reveal how their structures and dynamics are affected by the constraints of their geometries. The circDNAs are more bent and flexible than circRNAs, with distinctly different arrangements of phosphate backbones and bases. Small circNAs can sequester counterions in conformations that resemble crown ethers for the smallest (6-8 nucleotide long) molecules examined, in contrast to their linear counterparts.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cochlear Implant (CI) users often suffer difficulties in perceiving speech in noisy environments that could be attributed to reduced Auditory Stream Segregation (ASS) ability. ASS is the process used to separate a complex sound into different perceptual streams. The evidence that CI listeners routinely experience stream segregation skill is limited and equivocal. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of temporal cues on ASS performance in postlingually deaf listeners with CI. METHODS: Nineteen (age range: 28-64 years old) monaurally cochlear implanted listener participated in this study. They were presented with 30-s sequences of alternating stimuli in a repeating A-B-A-A-B-A...sequence, where \"tone A\" corresponds to a stimulus applied to electrode 11, and \"tone B\" to a stimulus on one of the other electrode. To investigate the effect of temporal cues on ASS, four different tone repetition times (TRTs) were utilized: 50, 100, 150, and 200 ms. Speech discrimination scores in noise were also recorded for every CI recipients. RESULTS: Only 6 (32%) CI users demonstrated ASS pattern similar to the normal hearing subjects, while the majority of the users (n=13) possessed poorer ASS skills. An analysis of variance showed a significant effect of electrode separation (p<0.001) and TRT (p=0.041), but there was no significant interaction between electrode separation and TRT variables. The best ASS performance was obtained when TRT was 200 ms, and there was no significant effect for other TRT conditions. Moderate, significant correlations between streaming and speech discrimination measurement in noise was also observed (r=0.62), with better stream segregation associated with better understanding of speech in noise. CONCLUSION: ASS is a contributing factor in the ability to perceive speech in background noise. The inability of some CI recipients to perform stream segregation may therefore contribute to their difficulties in noisy backgrounds. Furthermore, stream segregation ability is related to the tone repetition time between the sounds.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: African Americans, especially men, have a higher incidence of lung cancer compared with all other racial and ethnic groups in the US. Self-reported race is frequently used in genomic research studies to capture an individual's race or ethnicity. However, it is clear from studies of genetic admixture that human genetic variation does not segregate into the same biologically discrete categories as socially defined categories of race. Previous studies have suggested that the degree of West African ancestry among African Americans can contribute to cancer risk in this population, though few studies have addressed this question in lung cancer. METHODS: Using a genetic ancestry panel of 100 SNPs, we estimated West African, European, and Native American ancestry in 1,407 self-described African Americans and 2,413 European Americans. RESULTS: We found that increasing West African ancestry was associated with increased risk of lung cancer among African American men (OR(Q5 vs Q1) = 2.55 (1.45-4.48), p = 0.001), while no association was observed in African American women (OR(Q5 vs Q1) = 0.90 (0.51-1.59), p = 0.56). This relationship diminished following adjustment for income and education. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic ancestry is not a major contributor to lung cancer risk or survival disparities.",

        "abstract": "CT has become a routine imaging modality based on its excellent ability of displaying lung structures and diseases. But, how to reduce radiation dose of routine CT examination is a concern for radiologists. Our study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using 80kVp and a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm to achieve one-tenth mSv dose chest CT in infants and young children. Thirty-two cases (study group, average age 1.71 +/- 1.01 years) underwent non-contrast chest CT examination at low dose with 80 kV, 4mAs and was reconstructed with MBIR (LD-MBIR) and the standard adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) algorithm (LD-ASIR); another group (control group) of 32 children underwent routine-dose chest CT with 100 kV and was reconstructed with ASIR only (RD-ASIR). The subjective and objective image quality of the three groups were measured and statistically compared. The radiation dose for the low dose scan was 0.09 +/- 0.02 mSv, 6% of the routine dose. All LD-MBIR images were diagnostically acceptable. Compared with the RD-ASIR images, the LD-MBIR images were similar in noise in the left ventricle, muscles, lung field, on-par in displaying large airways, lung lucency and mediastinum, but were inferior in displaying lung marking, small airways and mediastinum. Thus, MBIR images with low dose in pediatric chest CT can be used in the diagnosis for lung field and air way disorders in infants and young children.",

        "abstract": "Liquid water is the most commonly used environmental-friendly solvent and reactant in chemical reactions and physical processes. Conventionally, it is considered as a passive reactant. In this work, we investigate the potential of plasmon-activated water (PAW) with intrinsically reduced hydrogen-bonded structures compared to normal deionized (DI) water to serve as an active green energy resource. The efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation of water performed on a platinum electrode to form hydrogen peroxide is significantly enhanced in PAW compared to that in DI water. In addition, the limiting current density of the oxygen reduction reaction on a platinum/carbon-coated disk electrode is also enhanced when using PAW (in 0.9 wt % NaCl or in 0.1 M KOH). Moreover, the cell capacitance with semitransparent platinum-coated fluorine-doped SnO(2) electrodes is significantly increased from ca. 2 x 10(-9) to 6.1 x 10(-7) F when decreasing the applied frequency from 10 to 0.1 Hz in a cell containing PAW instead of DI water (without the supporting electrolyte). More interestingly, compared to that in DI water, the efficiencies of the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acid solution (0.05 M H(2)SO(4)) and the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH) performed with PAW in situ increase by about 20% with nanoscale-granulated gold electrodes under resonant illumination. These increases are more significant in neutral solutions for hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The COPA syndrome is a newly recognized monogenic, autosomal dominant autoimmune disease presenting mostly presenting in childhood. Clinical features include inflammation of the lungs, kidneys, and joints. Approximately twenty-six patients with COPA syndrome worldwide have been investigated all originating from eight families. Patients with this syndrome exhibit heterozygous monogenic missense mutations in the WD40 domain. This domain is a functionally-significant area of the alpha subunit of coatomer-associated protein (COPalpha) which encodes the coat protein complex I (COPI). The COPI dysfunction is also associated with autoantibody expansion. We report two patients with COPA syndrome. METHODS: All testing and molecular genetic analysis were performed after obtaining the informed consent of both the patient and parents. A retrospective chart review was carried out on both the patients. Demographic, clinical and laboratory findings were abstracted from outpatient and inpatient encounters. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), chest computed tomography (CT) scans, and lung biopsy histopathology reports were also reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: The index case and the father of the child both demonstrated a unique inflammatory pulmonary, arthritis, and renal disease triad starting in early childhood including pulmonary hemorrhage. The two patients had a novel COPA mutation previously undescribed. CONCLUSIONS: To date, only four pathological, genetic mutations have been reported that are compatible with COPA syndrome. We here report two patients with COPA syndrome within the same family with a novel COPA gene mutation different than the heterozygous monogenic missense mutations in the WD40 domain and distinct from the clinical phenotypes reported in the literature so far.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unintended intraoperative awareness with recall (AWR) is a potential complication of general anesthesia. Patients typically report recollections of (1) hearing sounds or conversations, (2) being unable to breathe or move, (3), feeling pain, and/or (4) experiencing emotional distress. The purpose of the current study was to identify and further characterize AWR experiences identified through postoperative surveys of a large unselected adult surgical cohort. METHODS: This is a substudy of a prospective registry study, which surveys patients on their health and well-being after surgery. Responses to 4 questions focusing on AWR were analyzed. Patients who reported AWR with pain, paralysis, and/or distress were contacted by telephone to obtain more information about their AWR experience. The interview results for patients who received general anesthesia were sent to 3 anesthesiologists, who adjudicated the reported AWR episodes. RESULTS: Of 48,151 surveys sent, 17,875 patient responses were received. Of these respondents, 622 reported a specific memory from the period between going to sleep and waking up from perceived general anesthesia and 282 of these reported related pain, paralysis, and/or distress. An attempt was made to contact these 282 patients, and 149 participated in a telephone survey. Among the 149 participants, 87 endorsed their prior report of AWR. However, only 22 of these patients had received general anesthesia, while 51 received only sedation and 14 received regional anesthesia. Three anesthesiologists independently adjudicated the survey results of the 22 general anesthesia cases and assigned 6 as definite AWR, 8 as possible AWR, and 8 as not AWR episodes. Of the 65 patients who confirmed their report of AWR after regional or sedation anesthesia, 37 (31 with sedation and 6 with regional anesthesia) had not expected to be conscious during surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The complication of AWR continues to occur during intended general anesthesia. Many reports of AWR episodes occur in patients receiving sedation or regional anesthesia and relate to incorrect expectations regarding anesthetic techniques and conscious experiences, representing a potential target for intervention.",

Retroviral DNA integration is a mandatory step and constitutes a prime target for antiretroviral therapy. This activity, conserved among retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, involves a viral nucleoprotein complex called intasome. In the last decade, a plethora of structural insights on retroviral DNA integration arose from the study of FV. Here, we review the biochemistry and the structural features of the FV integration apparatus and will also discuss the mechanism of action of strand transfer inhibitors.",

In this work, we investigate the effect of PCMH-related clinic redesign and resources on diabetes outcomes from 2008 to 2012 among Minnesota clinics certified as PCMHs by 2011 by using a Bayesian framework for a continuous difference-in-differences model. Data from the Physician Practice Connections-Research Survey were used to assess a clinic's maturity in primary care transformation, and diabetes outcomes were obtained from the MN Community Measurement (MNCM) program. These data have several characteristics that must be carefully considered from a modeling perspective, including the inability to match patients over time, the potential for dynamic confounding, and the hierarchical structure of clinics. An ad-hoc analysis suggests a significant correlation between PCMH-related clinic redesign and resources on diabetes outcomes; however, this effect is not detected after properly accounting for different sources of variability and confounding.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To summarizes the intratesticular condition of azoospermia patients, to understand azoospermia more intuitively, and improve the ability of clinical doctors to predict the success rate of microsperm extraction in azoospermia patients. METHODS: Azoospermia patients (excluding Klinefelter's syndrome) who underwent a micro-TESE during January 2014 and January 2018 in a single center were enrolled. The types of seminiferous tubules were summarized, and the clinical characteristics of different types of seminiferous tubules compared with the success rates of sperm extraction. In this study, 472 cases of non-obstructive azoospermia (excluding Klinefelter's syndrome) were analyzed by SPSS 21.0 software package. Relevant data were expressed by median(minimum,maximum).t-test was used to compare the difference of success rate of sperm extraction between each group and the group with the lowest rate (a type). RESULTS: The 472 patients with non-obstructive azoospermia underwent micro-TESE. The mean age of the patients was 31 (23, 46) years, the mean testicular size was 10 (1, 20) mL, the mean FSH was 15.4 (1.21, 68.4) IU/L, the mean T was 8.34 (0.69, 30.2) nmol/L, and totally 202 patients achieved success in micro-TESE (42.7%, 202/472). According to the seminiferous tubules seen during the operation, they were divided into the following six types: Class a, seminiferous tubules developed well and uniformly; Class b, seminiferous tubules developed well, occasionally slightly thick; Class c, seminiferous tubules were generally thin; Class d, seminiferous tubules basically atrophied, occasionally well-developed seminiferous tubules; Class e, all seminiferous tubules atrophied; Class f, seminiferous tubules were infiltrated by yellow substances. The success rate of micro-TESE varied greatly among different types of the patients. A total of 78 patients with type a were 29 (24, 40) years old, FSH 11.1 (1.21, 15.8) IU/L, T 10.2 (3.29, 26.5) nmol/L), and testicular size 12 (12, 20) mL. The successful rate of sperm extraction was 6.41%; 82 patients with type b were 31 (23, 42) years old, FSH 13.8 (3.23, 19.6) IU/L, T 9.44 (3.58, 30.2) nmol/L), and testicular size 12(8,15) mL. The successful rate of sperm extraction was 74.39%; There were 162 patients in group c, aged 31 (25, 40), FSH 19.6 (9.28, 26.6) IU/L, T 8.75 (5.66, 18.6) nmol/L, and testicular size 8 (5, 12) mL. The successful rate of sperm extraction was 45.06%. There were 36 patients in group d, aged 25 (23,38) years and FSH 28.5 (19.3, 45.6) IU/L, T 6.52 (2.12, 9.83) nmol/L, and testicular size 5 (3, 8) mL, and the success rate of sperm extraction was 94.44%. 26 patients with type e were 28(23, 46) years old, FSH 31.3 (18.5, 68.4) IU/L, T 6.72 (0.69, 18.2) nmol/L, and testicular size 5 (1, 8) mL. The success rate of sperm extraction was 45.38%. 88 patients with type f were 29 (24, 38) years old, FSH 18.5 (5.23, 31.6) IU / L, T 8.32 (3.58, 16.5) nmol/L, and testicular size 12 (6, 20) mL. The success rate of sperm extraction was 28.41%.

        "abstract": "Idiopathic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are a group of diseases that are often difficult to diagnose due to the wide range of clinical manifestations. Notably, renal involvement is a serious organ complication, which usually requires intensive immunosuppressive therapy and is prone to recurrence. In recent years, there has been some progress regarding the understanding of the pathogenesis of the diseases. It has been shown that both cocaine and levamisole, which is a common adulterant of cocaine, can trigger the formation of ANCAs and lead to the corresponding symptoms. We report two cases of AAV with different renal manifestations associated with cocaine consumption. Furthermore, we performed a review of the literature to identify, characterize and describe histologically documented cases of renal involvement in AAV, related to cocaine abuse. Cocaine/levamisole-induced vasculitis may, therefore, mimic idiopathic AAV. Although the detection of ANCA and anti-PR3 (proteinase 3, PR3) as well as anti-MPO antibodies (myeloperoxidase, MPO) are the serological hallmark of idiopathic AAV, certain clinical- and antibody constellations should lead to consideration of illicit drugs as inductors of the disease. Especially in young patients, certain serologic constellations (e.g., PR3 and MPO double positivity, positive antinuclear antibodies, low complement level, and positive testing for antiphospholipid antibodies), skin involvement, musculoskeletal symptoms and hematologic (anemia, leukopenia) affections should prompt testing for cocaine and levamisole consumption via urine drug testing. Treatment includes both immunosuppressive approaches and drug cessation but is difficult since many patients continue cocaine consumption.",

METHOD: An observational retrospective study in 12,327 singleton pregnancies to analyze the results of the combined first trimester screening, the nuchal translucency >/=97.5 percentile, their cytogenetic results and birth outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 533 (4.3%) pregnant women had a risk in combined first trimester screening above 1/300. In this group, sixty nine had an unbalanced karyotype. The abnormal/normal karyotype ratio was 1/28 in pregnant women with intermediate risk (1/51-1/300) for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, 1/58 with intermediate risk just for trisomy 21 and 1/37 with intermediate risk just for trisomy 18. A 19.8% of the unbalanced karyotypes had chromosomal abnormalities other than trisomies 21, 18 and 13. Two false negatives cases at first trimester combined screening presented a nuchal translucency >/= p97.5(th). CONCLUSION: We propose the introduction of the cell-free fetal DNA test when the risk of first trimester combined screening is intermediate (1/51-1/300) and when nuchal translucency is >/= p97.5(th) with a low risk in the combined screening. This policy would allow us to continue to detect uncommon chromosomal abnormalities.",

One of the enzymes is pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2), which is allosterically regulated by various small molecules. Using detailed biochemical and kinetic studies, we demonstrate that cysteine inhibits wild-type (wt) PKM2 by shifting from an active tetramer to a mixture of a tetramer and a less active dimer/monomer equilibrium and that the inhibition is dependent on cysteine concentration. The cysteine-mediated PKM2 inhibition is reversed by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of PKM2. Furthermore, kinetic studies using two dimeric PKM2 variants, S437Y PKM2 and G415R PKM2, show that the reversal is caused by the tetramerization of wtPKM2. The crystal structure of the wtPKM2-Cys complex was determined at 2.25 A, which showed that cysteine is held to the amino acid binding site via its main chain groups, similar to that observed for phenylalanine, alanine, serine, and tryptophan. Notably, ligand binding studies using fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry show that the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate alters the binding affinities of amino acids for wtPKM2 and vice versa, thereby unravelling the existence of a functionally bidirectional coupling between the amino acid binding site and the active site of wtPKM2.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a challenge globally. To counteract crowding in day-to-day operations, better tools to improve monitoring of the patient flow in the ED is needed. The objective of this study was the development of a continuously updated monitoring system to forecast emergency department (ED) arrivals on a short time-horizon incorporating data from prehospital services. METHODS: Time of notification and ED arrival was obtained for all 191,939 arrivals at the ED of a Norwegian university hospital from 2010 to 2018. An arrival notification was an automatically captured time stamp which indicated the first time the ED was notified of an arriving patient, typically by a call from an ambulance to the emergency service communication center. A Poisson time-series regression model for forecasting the number of arrivals on a 1-, 2- and 3-h horizon with continuous weekly and yearly cyclic effects was implemented. We incorporated time of arrival notification by modelling time to arrival as a time varying hazard function. We validated the model on the last full year of data. RESULTS: In our data, 20% of the arrivals had been notified more than 1 hour prior to arrival. By incorporating time of notification into the forecasting model, we saw a substantial improvement in forecasting accuracy, especially on a one-hour horizon. In terms of mean absolute prediction error, we observed around a six percentage-point decrease compared to a simplified prediction model. The increase in accuracy was particularly large for periods with large inflow. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model shows increased predictability in ED patient inflow when incorporating data on patient notifications. This approach to forecasting arrivals can be a valuable tool for logistic, decision making and ED resource management.",

METHODS: We evaluated consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke with distal occlusion in anterior circulation, including occlusions of the M2/M3 or A2/A3 segments, who received endovascular therapy (EVT) in a single center. Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infraction (mTICI) score including TICI 2C category, processing time from puncture to reperfusion, proportion of a favorable clinical outcome at discharge (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score </=2), and incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) were compared between the DCT and single device approach technique (non-DCT) groups. RESULTS: Of 65 patients, 28 were treated with EVT using the DCT and 37 were treated with EVT with a single device approach (non-DCT). In the DCT group, a higher reperfusion rate at the first pass (mTICI score >/=2B, 92% vs. 54%; P = 0.0008; mTICI score >/=2C, 71% vs. 16%; P < 0.0001; mTICI score 3, 57% vs. 14%; P = 0.0004) and shorter time from puncture to successful reperfusion (median, 31 vs. 43 minutes; P = 0.0006) were achieved, respectively. The final successful reperfusion rate was also higher in the DCT group than in the non-DCT group (mTICI score >/=2C, 85% vs. 51%; P = 0.004; mTICI score 3, 75% vs. 43%; P = 0.012), respectively. sICH occurred in 2 patients in the non-DCT group. Patients with mRS score </=2 at discharge were more prevalent in the DCT than in the non-DCT group (57% vs. 27%, respectively; P = 0.021).

Intersections with the health care system offer an opportunity for intervention; however, recent estimates of prevalence for unhealthy substance use among all types of hospital inpatients are unknown. Methods: Universal screening for unhealthy alcohol or drug use was implemented across a 999-bed general hospital between January 1 and December 31, 2015. Nurses completed alcohol screening using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test alcohol consumption questions (AUDIT-C) with a cutoff of >/=5 for moderate risk and >/=8 for high risk and drug screening using the single-item screening question with >/=1 episode of use considered positive. Results: Out of 35,288 unique inpatients, screens were completed on 21,519. There were 3,451 positive screens (16% of all completed screens), including 1,291 (6%) moderate risk and 1,111 (5%) high risk screens for alcohol and 1,657 (8%) positive screens for drug use. Among screens that were positive for moderate- or high-risk alcohol use, 221 (17%) and 297 (27%), respectively, were concurrently positive for drug use. The majority (61%) of patients with unhealthy alcohol use was on the medical services. Men, those who were white or Hispanic, middle-aged, single, unemployed, or screened positive for drug use were more likely to screen positive for high-risk alcohol use. Those who were younger, single, worked less than full time, or screened high risk for alcohol were more likely to screen positive for drug use. Discordance between diagnosis coding and screening results was noted: 29% of high-risk alcohol use screens had no alcohol diagnosis coding associated with that admission, and 51% of patients with a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) diagnosis code of alcohol dependence had AUDIT-C scores of <8. Conclusions: Across a general hospital, 16% of patients screened positive for unhealthy substance use, with the highest volume on medical floors.

        "abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome, perioperative complications, and prognostic factors of anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) in patients with cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is little information on the long-term surgical outcome of ACDF including postsurgical remnant ossified spinal lesion. METHODS: Between 1993 and 2013, 80 patients with cervical myelopathy towing to OPLL underwent ACDF at our hospital. Among these, 42 patients were followed-up for at least 5 years and their data were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 7.9 +/- 2.8 years, and the overall improvement rate was 59.2% +/- 15.0%. Although 12 (15.0%) perioperative complications were observed in 6 patients, accompanied by neurological deterioration, none of the patients had chronic complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis that included the preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, type of OPLL, occupying ratio of OPLL, and number of fused segments and increase in the transverse area of the cord identified the latter parameter as the only independent and significant determinant of radiological and clinical improvement of >50%. Among the patients with remaining ossified spinal lesions out of the decompressed range (16 patients), postoperative progression was observed in 6 cases (14.3%) who were all of the mixed type; floated lesions within the decompressed range did not show progression during the follow-up. Adjacent segment degeneration was seen in nine (21.4%) patients, and neurological signs and symptoms were seen in only three of the nine patients and only one patient required revision surgery. CONCLUSION: The long-term clinical outcome of patients with cervical OPLL after ACDF is considered satisfactory. Surgery-related complications and adjacent segment diseases should not be reasons to avoid ACDF. Care should be taken in selecting ACDF with postsurgical remnant ossified spinal lesion, as it could progress postoperatively especially in the mixed type OPLL. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

This study identified a role of VISTA in regulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in myeloid cells and controlling myeloid cell-mediated inflammation and immunosuppression. VISTA modulated the polyubiquitination and protein expression of TRAF6. Consequently, VISTA dampened TLR-mediated activation of MAPK/AP-1 and IKK/NF-kappaB signaling cascades. At cellular levels, VISTA regulated the effector functions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tolerogenic dendritic cell (DC) subsets. Blocking VISTA augmented their ability to produce proinflammatory mediators and diminished their T cell-suppressive functions. These myeloid cell-dependent effects resulted in a stimulatory tumor microenvironment that promoted T-cell infiltration and activation. We conclude that VISTA is a critical myeloid cell-intrinsic immune-checkpoint protein and that the reprogramming of tolerogenic myeloid cells following VISTA blockade promotes the development of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity.",

The Index of Nutritional Quality (INQ) is a method of quantitative and qualitative evaluation of single foods and diets, which has special significance in recognizing clinical nutritional problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 295 patients with NAFLD and 704 controls. The dietary intake was assessed through a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. INQ was calculated from the questionnaire data and was compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The controls had higher INQ of vitamin D, vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B12; biotin, pantothenic acid, magnesium and zinc compared to the patients with NAFLD. After controlling for several covariates, positive associations were observed between NAFLD risk and INQs of riboflavin (OR(riboflavin)\u202f=\u202f0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28-0.78; OR(biotin)\u202f=\u202f0.35, 95% CI: 0.18-0.76; OR(pantothenic)\u202f=\u202f0.28, 95% CI: 0.12-0.64; OR(magnesium)\u202f=\u202f0.28, 95% CI: 0.11-0.75; OR(zinc)\u202f=\u202f0.15 95% CI: 0.05-0.42). CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the present study suggest that subjects who follow a more healthy and nutrient-rich diet, especially in terms of vitamins D, B1, B2, B12, B3 and zinc, are at a lower risk of NAFLD compared to those who consume unhealthy and nutrient-poor diet.",

Recently, the use of multiplex assays has transformed the goal of group testing from detecting a single disease to diagnosing multiple infections simultaneously. Existing research on multiple-infection group testing data either exclude individual covariate information or ignore possible retests on suspicious individuals. To incorporate both, we propose a new regression model. This new model allows us to perform a regression analysis for each infection using multiple-infection group testing data. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient variable selection method to reveal truly relevant risk factors for each disease. Our methodology also allows for the estimation of the assay sensitivity and specificity when they are unknown. We examine the finite sample performance of our method through extensive simulation studies and apply it to a chlamydia and gonorrhea screening data set to illustrate its practical usefulness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While dietary intake is known to influence serum markers of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), the effects of recent food and beverage intake, particularly phosphorus consumption on these serum markers (phosphate, calcium, and parathyroid hormone [PTH]), are unknown in hemodialysis patients. An understanding of these effects could have direct and important implications on the management of CKD-MBD. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum phosphate, calcium, and PTH levels were higher in hemodialysis patients who had consumed dietary phosphorus within 1 hour prior to their routine dialysis-related blood work (non-phosphorus-fasted) compared with patients who did not (phosphorus-fasted). DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Kingston Health Sciences Center-Kingston General Hospital Site and its affiliated satellite hemodialysis units. PATIENTS: Two hundred fifty-four adult patients receiving outpatient hemodialysis treatment for end-stage kidney disease were recruited. MEASUREMENTS: The main measurements for this study included an assessment of dietary phosphorus intake as well as serum phosphate, calcium, PTH, albumin, Kt/V, and urea reduction ratio. METHODS: A direct patient interview was performed to assess dietary phosphorus intake within 1 hour prior to routine dialysis-related blood work. The Canadian Nutrient File was then used to estimate dietary phosphorus based on the specific foods and beverages (including portion sizes and brands where applicable) identified in the interview. Serum measures of phosphate, PTH, calcium, albumin, and dialysis adequacy (Kt/V and urea reduction ratio) were obtained from participants' routine dialysis-related blood work. RESULTS: Non-phosphorus-fasted participants had nonsignificantly higher serum PTH levels compared to phosphorus-fasted participants (61.2 +/- 64.7 vs 47.9 +/- 39.7, P = .05). Non-phosphorus-fasted participants with PTH levels at the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) \"target\" (between 15 and 60 pmol/L) had significantly higher serum phosphate levels relative to phosphorus-fasted participants (1.6 +/- 0.3 vs 1.4 +/- 0.4, P = .006). In non-phosphorus-fasted participants, there was a nonsignificant association between the number of items containing inorganic phosphate additives and higher levels of serum phosphate and lower levels of serum calcium. LIMITATIONS: Some limitations include the cross-sectional nature of this study, self-reporting biases and estimates (as opposed to direct measurements) related to the dietary assessment, and the use of single (and not serial) assessments of serum measures. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary phosphorus intake in close proximity to blood work may contribute to subtle alterations in some key serum CKD-MBD parameters in adult outpatient hemodialysis patients but may not meaningfully alter CKD-MBD management.",

Clear strategies can then be designed to control both the axial and transverse contributions to the magnetic anisotropy in such compounds, and allow them to reach their full potential. Here we show a strategy for boosting the magnetic anisotropy in a series of trigonal bipyramidal Mn(ii) complexes - [MnCl(3)(HDABCO)(DABCO)] (1), [MnCl(3)(MDABCO)(2)].[ClO(4)] (2), and [MnCl(3)(H(2)O)(MDABCO)] (3). These have been successfully synthesised using the monodentate [DABCO] and [MDABCO](+) ligands. Through static (DC) magnetic measurements and detailed theoretical investigation using ab initio methods, the magnetic anisotropy of each system has been studied. The calculations reveal that the rhombic zero-field splitting (ZFS) term (E) can be tuned as the symmetry around the Mn(ii) ion is changed. Furthermore, an in silico investigation reveals a strategy to increase the axial ZFS parameter (D) of trigonal bipyramidal Mn(ii) by an order of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory disease is a leading cause of hospitalizations and deaths in young people with cerebral palsy (CP). It is insidious and multifactorial. Clinical management can be complex. This systematic review describes effects of interventions for the prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP. METHODS: Nine databases (Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, EMCare, MEDLINE, PEDro, OpenGrey, ScienceDirect, and SpeechBITE) were searched. Eligibility criteria were as follows: the population included at least 50% individuals with CP aged under 26 years, the intervention was for chronic respiratory illness, the outcomes were any measurable indicators of respiratory health or morbidity; the study design could be any original study reporting effects of an intervention on measurable outcomes, and the study was published January 1998 or later. The American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine methodology guided study appraisal and synthesis. The review was registered with PROSPERO (reference number CRD42018086314). RESULTS: The search yielded 3,347 papers; 37 papers (reporting 34 studies) of these met the eligibility criteria. They included 582 participants with CP (ranging from 1 to 77 across studies) with ages from 5 months to 25 years. Interventions were diverse and included: airway clearance techniques, exercise, positioning, mealtime management, salivary management, upper airway interventions, antibiotics, gastro-intestinal interventions, and spinal surgery. There were no interventions aimed at prevention of respiratory disease in this population. Research designs were classified as Levels 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 2), 4 (n = 25), and 5 (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for most respiratory interventions for young people with CP is absent or weak. No controlled trials demonstrated significant effects on respiratory morbidity, owing to their scarcity, weak designs, and inadequate power. There is an urgent need for well-designed prospective controlled studies investigating prevention and management of respiratory disease in young people with CP.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is associated with an increased risk of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS). However, specific factors that influence the risk of OASIS at VBAC have not been studied, particularly whether there are specific baseline characteristics of the first delivery which affect the subsequent perineal outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from University of Southampton NHS Foundation Trusts' maternity database. This included secundiparous women with a previous caesarean delivery (CS) who achieved a singleton, term, cephalic vaginal delivery from 2004 to 2014. Univariate analysis compared maternal, intrapartum and neonatal factors of those who suffered OASIS at VBAC with those who did not. A binary logistic regression model calculated the adjusted, independent odds ratio (OR) of OASIS. RESULTS: A total of 1375 women met the inclusion criteria. The OASIS rate was 8.1%, a 1.4-fold increase compared with primiparous women [difference 2.4% (95% CI 1.1, 3.6)]. Those sustaining OASIS at VBAC were older (p = 0.011) and had infants of greater birth weight at initial caesarean (p < 0.001) and VBAC (p = 0.04). Analysis of odds ratios revealed that mediolateral episiotomy (MLE) at VBAC halved the risk of OASIS [37.5% VBAC with OASIS vs. 52.2% VBAC without OASIS (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.81)], whereas an urgent CS at initial delivery doubled the risk [52.3% VBAC with OASIS vs. 34.9% VBAC without OASIS (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.21)]. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced maternal age, increased infant birth weight and an urgent category of initial CS increase the risk of OASIS at VBAC, whereas MLE is protective.",

Ultrathin Au was introduced to increase the conductivity of metal mesh, and the optimal hexagonal Ni (30 nm)/Au (10 nm) mesh (line width of 5 mum) shows a transmittance close to 80% in the visible light region and a sheet resistance lower than 16.9 Omega/sq. The conductive polymer PH1000 not only smooths the raised surface of the metal mesh but also enhances the charge collection ability of metal mesh. The fabricated PSCs have the typical planar structure (glass/Ni-Au mesh/PH1000/PEDOT:PSS/MA(y)FA(1-y)PbI(x)Cl(3-x)/PCBM/BCP/Ag) and the champion PSC (0.09 cm(2)) obtains a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.88%, negligible current hysteresis, steady current density and PCE outputs, and good process repeatability. Its photovoltaic performance and stability are comparable to the reference PSC based on the ITO electrodes (PCE = 15.70%), which demonstrates that the Ni/Au mesh transparent electrodes are a promising ITO alternative to fabricate efficient PSCs. The relatively lower performance of Ni/Au based PSC results from the relatively slower charge extraction and stronger charge recombination than the ITO based PSC. Further, we tried to fabricate the large area (1 cm(2)) device and achieve a PCE over 6% with negligible hysteresis and steady current density and PCE outputs. The improvements of perovskite film quality and interface modification should be an effective approach to further enhance the device performance of Ni/Au based PSCs, and the Ni/Au mesh electrode may find wider applications in PSCs and flexible devices.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we have characterized the lineage of two traits associated with the coat proteins (CPs) of the tombusvirids: Silencing suppression and HR elicitation in Nicotiana species. We considered that the tombusvirid CPs might collectively be considered an effector, with the CP of each CP-encoding species comprising a structural variant within the family. Thus, a phylogenetic analysis of the CP could provide insight into the evolution of a pathogen effector. The phylogeny of the CP of tombusvirids indicated that CP representatives of the family could be divided into four clades. In two separate clades the CP triggered a hypersensitive response (HR) in Nicotiana species of section Alatae but did not have silencing suppressor activity. In a third clade the CP had a silencing suppressor activity but did not have the capacity to trigger HR in Nicotiana species. In the fourth clade, the CP did not carry either function. Our analysis illustrates how structural changes that likely occurred in the CP effector of progenitors of the current genera led to either silencing suppressor activity, HR elicitation in select Nicotiana species, or neither trait.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of treatment of wheat straw using ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) and exogenous fibrolytic enzymes (Viscozyme) on fiber digestibility, rumen fermentation, microbial protein synthesis, and microbial populations in an artificial rumen system [Rumen Simulation Technique (RUSITEC)]. Four treatments were assigned to 16 vessels (4 per treatment) in 2 RUSITEC apparatuses in a randomized block design. Treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial using untreated or AFEX-treated wheat straw with or without exogenous fibrolytic enzymes [0 or 500 mug of protein/g straw dry matter (DM)]. Fibrolytic enzymes were applied to straw, prior to sealing in nylon bags. The concentrate mixture was provided in a separate bag within each fermentation vessel. The RUSITECs were adapted for 8 d and disappearance of DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude protein (CP) was measured after 48 h of incubation. Ammonia fiber expansion increased (P < 0.01) the disappearance of wheat straw DM (69.6 vs. 38.3%), NDF (65.6 vs. 36.8%), ADF (61.4 vs. 36.0%), and CP (68.3 vs. 24.0%). Total dietary DM, organic matter (OM), and NDF disappearance was also increased (P </= 0.05) by enzymes. Total microbial protein production was greater (P < 0.01) for AFEX-treated (72.9 mg/d) than untreated straw (63.1 mg/d). Total gas and methane (CH4) production (P < 0.01) were also greater for AFEX-treated wheat straw than untreated straw, with a tendency for total gas to increase (P = 0.06) with enzymes. Ammonia fiber expansion increased (P < 0.01) total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and the molar proportion of propionate, while it decreased (P < 0.01) acetate and the acetate-to-propionate ratio. The AFEX-treated straw had lower relative quantities of fungi, methanogens, and Fibrobacter succinogenes (P < 0.01) and fewer protozoa (P < 0.01) compared to untreated straw. The pH of fermenters fed AFEX-treated straw was lower (P < 0.01) than those fed untreated straw. Both AFEX (P < 0.01) and enzymes (P = 0.02) decreased xylanase activity. There was an enzyme x straw interaction (P = 0.02) for endoglucanase activity. Enzymes increased endoglucanase activity of AFEX-treated wheat straw, but had no effect on untreated straw. The addition of enzymes lowered the relative abundance of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, but increased F. succinogenes. These results indicate that AFEX increased the ruminal disappearance of wheat straw and improved fermentation and microbial protein synthesis in the RUSITEC.",

METHODS: The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve faculty members in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, asking them about their research practices, habits, and preferences. RESULTS: Faculty scholars disseminate their research findings in a variety of formats intended for multiple audiences, including not only their peers in academia, but also public health practitioners, policymakers, government and other agencies, and community partners. CONCLUSION: Librarians who serve public health faculty should bear in mind the diversity of faculty's information needs when designing and improving library services and resources, particularly those related to research dissemination and knowledge translation. Promising areas for growth in health sciences libraries include supporting data visualization, measuring the impact of non-scholarly publications, and promoting institutional repositories for dissemination of research.",

METHODS: To clarify this dichotomous role in breast cancer, miR-23b and miR-27b were knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout technology, and the role of endogenous miR-23b and miR-27b was examined in a breast cancer model system in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Characterization of the knockout cells in vitro demonstrated that miR-23b and miR-27b are indeed oncogenic miRNAs in MCF7 breast cancer cells. miR-23b and miR-27b knockout reduced tumor growth in xenograft nude mice fed a standard diet, supporting their oncogenic role in vivo. However, when xenograft mice were provided a fish-oil diet, miR-27b depletion, but not miR-23b depletion, compromised fish-oil-induced suppression of xenograft growth, indicating a context-dependent nature of miR-27b oncogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that miR-23b and miR-27b are primarily oncogenic in MCF7 breast cancer cells and that miR-27b may have tumor suppressive activity under certain circumstances.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a hostile brain tumor associated with high infiltration leading to poor prognosis. Anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents have limited access into the brain due to the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we designed a dual functionalized liposomal delivery system, surface modified with transferrin (Tf) for receptor mediated transcytosis and a cell penetrating peptide-penetratin (Pen) for enhanced cell penetration. We loaded doxorubicin and erlotinib into liposomes to enhance their translocation across the BBB to glioblastoma tumor. In vitro cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility studies demonstrated excellent biocompatibility for in vivo administration. Co-delivery of doxorubicin and erlotinib loaded Tf-Pen liposomes revealed significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) higher translocation (~15%) across the co-culture endothelial barrier resulting in regression of tumor in the in vitro brain tumor model. The biodistribution of Tf-Pen liposomes demonstrated ~12 and 3.3 fold increase in doxorubicin and erlotinib accumulation in mice brain, respectively compared to free drugs. In addition, Tf-Pen liposomes showed excellent antitumor efficacy by regressing ~90% of tumor in mice brain with significant increase in the median survival time (36\u202fdays) along with no toxicity. Thus, we believe that this study would have high impact for treating patients with glioblastoma.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cardiopulmonary bypass-induced endothelial dysfunction has been inferred by changes in pulmonary vascular resistance, alterations in circulating biomarkers, and postoperative capillary leak. Endothelial-dependent vasomotor dysfunction of the systemic vasculature has never been quantified in this setting. The objective of the present study was to quantify acute effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on endothelial vasomotor control and attempt to correlate these effects with postoperative cytokines, tissue edema, and clinical outcomes in infants. DESIGN: Single-center prospective observational cohort pilot study. SETTING: Pediatric cardiac ICU at a tertiary children's hospital. PATIENTS: Children less than 1 year old requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of a congenital heart lesion. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Laser Doppler perfusion monitoring was coupled with local iontophoresis of acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodilator) or sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent vasodilator) to quantify endothelial-dependent vasomotor function in the cutaneous microcirculation. Measurements were obtained preoperatively, 2-4 hours, and 24 hours after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Fifteen patients completed all laser Doppler perfusion monitor (Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden) measurements. Comparing prebypass with 2-4 hours postbypass responses, there was a decrease in both peak perfusion (p = 0.0006) and area under the dose-response curve (p = 0.005) following acetylcholine, but no change in responses to sodium nitroprusside. Twenty-four hours after bypass responsiveness to acetylcholine improved, but typically remained depressed from baseline. Conserved endothelial function was associated with higher urine output during the first 48 postoperative hours (R = 0.43; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous endothelial dysfunction is present in infants immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass and recovers significantly in some patients within 24 hours postoperatively. Confirmation of an association between persistent endothelial-dependent vasomotor dysfunction and decreased urine output could have important clinical implications. Ongoing research will explore the pattern of endothelial-dependent vasomotor dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass and its relationship with biochemical markers of inflammation and clinical outcomes.",

However, in the last few decades, various adaptations have been discovered that allow algae, cyanobacteria, and even plants to utilize longer wavelength light in the far-red spectral range. These adaptations provide distinct advantages to the species possessing them, allowing the effective utilization of shade light under highly filtered light environments. In prokaryotes, these adaptations include the production of far-red-absorbing chlorophylls d and f and the remodeling of phycobilisome antennas and reaction centers. Eukaryotes express specialized light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes that use interactions between pigments and their protein environment to spectrally tune the absorption of chlorophyll a. If these adaptations could be applied to crop plants, a potentially significant increase in photon utilization in lower shaded leaves could be realized, improving crop yields.",

        "abstract": "Chronic viral disease constitutes a major global health problem, with several hundred million people affected and an associated elevated number of deaths. An increasing number of disorders caused by human flaviviruses are related to their capacity to establish a persistent infection. Here we show that Usutu virus (USUV), an emerging zoonotic flavivirus linked to sporadic neurologic disease in humans, can establish a persistent infection in cell culture. Two independent lineages of Vero cells surviving USUV lytic infection were cultured over 82 days (41 cell transfers) without any apparent cytopathology crisis associated. We found elevated titers in the supernatant of these cells, with modest fluctuations during passages but no overall tendency towards increased or decreased infectivity. In addition to full-length genomes, viral RNA isolated from these cells at passage 40 revealed the presence of defective genomes, containing different deletions at the 5' end. These truncated transcripts were all predicted to encode shorter polyprotein products lacking membrane and envelope structural proteins, and most of non-structural protein 1. Treatment with different broad-range antiviral nucleosides revealed that USUV is sensitive to these compounds in the context of a persistent infection, in agreement with previous observations during lytic infections. The exposure of infected cells to prolonged treatment (10 days) with favipiravir and/or ribavirin resulted in the complete clearance of infectivity in the cellular supernatants (decrease of ~5 log(10) in virus titers and RNA levels), although modest changes in intracellular viral RNA levels were recorded (<2 log(10) decrease). Drug withdrawal after treatment day 10 resulted in a relapse in virus titers. These results encourage the use of persistently-infected cultures as a surrogate system in the identification of improved antivirals against flaviviral chronic disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess MRI features for the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and especially for nodules not showing both of the typical hallmarks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and sixty-four cirrhotic patients underwent liver MRI for 10-30 mm nodules suggestive of HCC. The diagnostic performances of MRI features [T1, T2; diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging signal, enhancement, capsule, fat content] were tested, both individually and in association with both typical hallmarks and as substitutions for one hallmark. The diagnostic reference was obtained using a multifactorial algorithm ensuring high specificity (Sp). RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-three nodules were analyzed. No alternative features, associations or substitutions outperformed the typical hallmarks for the diagnosis of HCC. For 10-20 mm nodules not displaying one of the typical hallmarks, hyperintensity on DW images was the most accurate substitutive sign, providing a sensitivity of 71.4% and Sp of 75% for nodules without arterial enhancement and sensitivity = 65.2% and Sp = 66% for nodules without washout on the portal or delayed phases. A new diagnostic algorithm, including typical hallmarks as a first step then the best-performing substitutive signs (capsule presence or DW hyperintensity) in combination with the nonmissing typical hallmark as a second step, enabled the correct classification of 77.7% of all nodules, regardless of size. CONCLUSION: Using MRI, the typical hallmarks remain the best criteria for the diagnosis of small HCCs. However, by incorporating other MRI features, it is possible to build a simple algorithm enabling the noninvasive diagnosis of HCCs displaying both or only one of the typical hallmarks.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a deep learning protocol to identify neoplasia in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) in comparison to current radiographic criteria. METHODS: A computer-aided framework was designed using convolutional neural networks to classify IPMN. The protocol was applied to magnetic resonance images of the pancreas. Features of IPMN were classified according to American Gastroenterology Association guidelines, Fukuoka guidelines, and the new deep learning protocol. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using surgically resected cystic lesions or healthy controls. RESULTS: Of 139 cases, 58 (42%) were male; mean (standard deviation) age was 65.3 (11.9) years. Twenty-two percent had normal pancreas; 34%, low-grade dysplasia; 14%, high-grade dysplasia; and 29%, adenocarcinoma. The deep learning protocol sensitivity and specificity to detect dysplasia were 92% and 52%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity to identify high-grade dysplasia or cancer were 75% and 78%, respectively. Diagnostic performance was similar to radiologic criteria. Areas under the receiver operating curves (95% confidence interval) were 0.76 (0.70-0.84) for American Gastroenterology Association, 0.77 (0.70-0.85) for Fukuoka, and 0.78 (0.71-0.85) for the deep learning protocol (P = 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning protocol showed accuracy comparable to current radiographic criteria. Computer-aided frameworks could be implemented as aids for radiologists to identify high-risk IPMN.",

BCA has the advantages of high sensitivity, short detection time, simple operation, low cost, good repeatability and good linear relationship between detection results. However, bio-barcode technology is not yet fully formed as a complete detection system, and the detection process in all aspects and stages is unstable. Therefore, studying the optimal reaction conditions, optimizing the experimental steps, exploring the multi-residue detection of small-molecule substances, and preparing immuno-bio-barcode kits are important research directions for the standardization and commercialization of BCA. The main theme of this review was to describe the principle of BCA, provide a comparison of its application, and introduce the single-residue and multi-residue detection of macromolecules and single-residue detection of small molecules. We also compared it with other detection methods, summarized its feasibility and limitations, expecting that with further improvement and development, the technique can be more widely used in the field of stable small-molecule and multi-residue detection.",

        "abstract": "Astyanax mexicanus is emerging as a model organism for a variety of research fields in biological science. Part of the recent success of this teleost fish species is that it possesses interfertile cave and river-dwelling populations. This enables the genetic mapping of heritable traits that were fixed during adaptation to the different environments of these populations. While this species can be maintained and bred in the lab, it is challenging to both obtain embryos during the daytime and create hybrid embryos between strains. In vitro fertilization (IVF) has been used with a variety of different model organisms to successfully and repeatedly breed animals in the lab. In this protocol, we show how, by acclimatizing A. mexicanus to different light cycles coupled with changes in water temperature, we can shift breeding cycles to a chosen time of the day. Subsequently, we show how to identify suitable parental fish, collect healthy gametes from males and females, and produce viable offspring using IVF. This enables related procedures such as the injection of genetic constructs or developmental analysis to occur during normal working hours. Furthermore, this technique can be used to create hybrids between the cave and surface-dwelling populations, and thereby enable the study of the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptations to different environments.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the nation works to improve the opioid epidemic, safer opioid prescribing is needed. Prescriber education is one method to assist with this aim. To gauge current surgical residents' opioid prescribing practices at a safety-net hospital, an evaluation was completed before a general surgery-specific opioid prescribing education (OPE) session. The effectiveness of this OPE was measured through a postparticipation evaluation. METHODS: A voluntary, anonymous evaluation immediately before and after a one-hour OPE session was performed at an urban safety-net hospital. Descriptive statistics and Student's t-test comparisons of means were performed to analyze the results. RESULTS: Twenty-three residents completed the surveys. Eleven (47.8%) completed prior OPE with the most common modality being online (7, 63.6%). No participant performed an opioid risk assessment before prescribing opioids. More than half of the residents (14, 60.9%) never used the prescription drug monitoring program. Less than 1/3 (7, 30.4%) used preoperative gabinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin) for elective surgeries. Only two residents provided information on unused opioid disposal. After the OPE, the participants were more likely to prescribe preoperative gabinoids (7 versus 21, P < 0.001). The mean opioid pills prescribed for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, open inguinal hernia repair, laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, and laparoscopic appendectomy were reduced by 2.6 (14.2%, P = 0.23), 3.7 (18.9%, P = 0.07), 2.6 (13.1%, P = 0.23), and 1.1 (7.3%, P = 0.60) pills, respectively. CONCLUSION: A short OPE delivered to surgical residents at a safety-net hospital significantly improved the use of preoperative gabinoids. Although the pill count reductions after the OPE were not statistically significant, there was a consistent reduction in amount of opiates prescribed after the OPE. However, clinical significance is important, as a reduction in any amount of opioid medication can help deter misuse and diversion. This suggests resident surgeons could participate in a specialty-specific OPE to improve opioid prescribing.",

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of the immunisation programmes from payer's perspective. Eight strategies with different ages to receive VVL or RZV were set, namely: 65-84\u202fyear old (y.o.), 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., and 80-84 y.o. VVL- or RZV-strategy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with curative care scenario were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort were as follows: acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, recurrence of HZ, and general death. RESULTS: At the vaccination cost  yen8000 (US$73) for 1-dose ZVL and  yen30,000 (US$273) for 2-dose RZV, ICERs ranged from  yen2,633,587/US$23,942 (age 80-84 y.o.) to  yen3,434,267 or US$31,221 (age 65-84 y.o.)/QALY gained for VVL-strategies; from  yen5,262,227 or US$47,838 (age 80-84 y.o.) to  yen6,278,557 or US$57,078/QALY gained (age 65-84 y.o.) for RZV-strategies. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that if the cost-effective threshold was at  yen3,000,000 or US$27,273/QALY, the acceptability was 90.7% and 8.8% for 65-84 VVL-strategy and 65-84 RZV-strategy, respectively; if at  yen5,000,000 or US$45,455/QALY, 56.2% and 43.8%, and if at  yen10,000,000 or US$90,909/QALY 11.9% and 88.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating individuals aged 65-84 y.o., 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., 80-84 y.o. with VVL or RZV to prevent HZ-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from payer's perspective, with vaccination costs at  yen8,000 per shot for VVL,  yen30,000 for 2-dose RZV. While the results suggesting that only 65-84 VVL-strategy and 65-84 RZV strategy should be considered when introducing HZ immunisation programme. The optimal strategy varies depending on the willingness-to-pay threshold.",

There are currently no drugs available for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD, suggesting an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The neurobiology of autism is complex, but emerging research indicates that defects in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with ASD in both humans and mouse models of ASD, leading to the suggestion that restoring neurogenesis may be a novel therapeutic approach for ASD. Here, we found that postnatal treatment with TO901317 (TO), a potent liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, typically activated LXRbeta and its target genes in the hippocampus, and alleviated the social deficits and stereotypical behaviors in BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) and valproic acid (VPA)-induced mouse models. In addition, we further confirmed that TO postnatal treatment also rescued the inhibition of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in these two models. In summary, our study suggests that LXR agonist targeting hippocampal neurogenesis may represent a novel potential therapy for ASD.",

We sought to define TPE in HIT practice patterns using an international survey. METHODS: A 31-item online survey was disseminated through the American Society for Apheresis. After institutional duplicate responses were eliminated, a descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 94 respondents from 78 institutions in 18 countries. Twenty-nine institutions (37%) used TPE for HIT (YES cohort) and 49 (63%) did not (NO cohort). Most NO respondents (65%) cited \"no requests received\" as the most common reason for not using TPE. Of the 29 YES respondents, 10 (34%) gave incomplete information and were excluded from the final analysis, leaving 19 responses. Of these, 18 (95%) treated </=10 HIT patients over a 2-year period. The most common indications were cardiovascular surgery (CS; 63%) and HIT-associated thrombosis (HT; 26%). The typical plasma volume processed was 1.0 (63% CS and 58% HT). For CS, the typical replacement fluid was plasma (42%) and for HT, it was determined on an individual basis (32%). For CS, patients were treated with a set number of TPE procedures (37%) or laboratory/clinical response (37%). For HT, the number of TPE procedures typically depended on laboratory/clinical response (42%). CONCLUSION: In a minority of responding institutions, TPE is most commonly used in HIT to prophylactically treat patients who will undergo heparin re-exposure during CS. Prospective studies are needed to more clearly define the role of TPE in HIT.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is used to assist the diagnosis and monitoring of newborn infection. Little is known about CRP activity after birth in the absence of infection. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to describe postnatal CRP responses in the first days of life in asymptomatic infants with a negative blood culture. METHODS: Data were collected from infants who had a blood culture taken at <72 h of age in a UK maternity hospital. All CRP values and their time from birth were recorded. Infants with signs of infection, positive blood culture, or major congenital anomalies were excluded. Infants were analysed by gestation (greater or less than 37 weeks). Normalised CRP curves were generated by linear interpolation and centile curves were derived. Comparisons of median CRP values between groups were made by Mann-Whitney U test at 24, 36, and 48 h. RESULTS: During the study period a total of 219 babies were screened. After exclusions, 73 infants (58 term, 15 preterm) were analysed. In asymptomatic term neonates the CRP (mg/L) peaked at 9.4 after 34.6 h. In preterm babies the CRP peak was 1.75 at 43 h. The median (IQR) values were higher in the term group at 24 and 36 h: 2.5 (1-10.5) versus 0 (0-2.2; p = 0.02) and 3 (0-8.6) versus 0 (0-2.8; p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: A CRP rise was demonstrated in term and preterm infants without evidence of infection. This rise was greatest in term infants. CRP values must be interpreted in the context of an infant's clinical condition and not used alone to guide clinical decision making.",

SOCS1, also called STAT-induced STAT inhibitor (SSI) or JAK-binding protein (JAB), is a member of the SOCS family with actions ranging from immune modulation to cell cycle regulation. Knockout of SOCS1 leads to perinatal lethality in mice and increased vulnerability to cancer, while several SNPs associated with the SOCS1 gene have been implicated in human inflammation-mediated diseases. In this review, we describe the mechanism of action of SOCS1 and its potential therapeutic role in the prevention and treatment of autoimmunity and cancer.

The potential of using antibody-based therapies that neutralize key players of low-grade inflammation has gained scientific momentum as a novel therapeutic strategy in metabolic diseases. As interleukin-6 (IL-6) is traditionally considered a key pro-inflammatory factor, the potential of expanding the use of anti-IL-6 therapies to metabolic diseases is intriguing. However, IL-6 is a molecule of a very pleiotropic nature that regulates many aspects of not only inflammation but also metabolism. In this review, we give a brief overview of the pro- and anti-inflammatory aspects of IL-6 and provide an update on its role in metabolic regulation, with a specific focus on glucose homeostasis and adipose tissue metabolism. Finally, we shall discuss the metabolic implications and clinical potential of blocking IL-6 signaling, focusing on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism.",

The octadecylsilane bonded silica gel was used as the stationary phase,with acetonitrile as the mobile phase A and0. 2% formic acid as the mobile phase B in a gradient elution procedure at a flow rate of 1. 0 m L.min-1. The detection wavelength was set at 280 nm and the column temperature was 25 \u2103. There were 22 common peaks,20 of which were selected from the fingerprint of LLF and its wine-steamed product,respectively,and 14 chromatographic peaks were identified with reference substances. With the same chromatographic conditions,seven components were quantitatively analyzed and the results of system adaptability and methodology investigation all met the requirements of content determination. Compared with the crude LLF,the content of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural and salidroside significantly increased in wine-steamed LLF,while the contents of iridoid glycosides generally decreased. The method provided a basis for quality control of LLF and its processed products as well as the related preparations."

We aimed to evaluate the natural history of kidney bone disease in contemporary kidney transplant recipients and patients on dialysis. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Sixty one patients on dialysis who were referred to kidney transplantation participated in this prospective cohort study during November 2009 and December 2010. We performed baseline bone biopsies while the patients were on dialysis and repeated the procedure in 56 patients at 2 years after kidney transplantation or 2 years after baseline if transplantation was not performed. Measurements of mineral metabolism and bone turnover, as well as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, were obtained concurrently. RESULTS: A total of 37 out of 56 participants received a kidney transplant, of which 27 underwent successful repeat bone biopsy. The proportion of patients with high bone turnover declined from 63% at baseline to 19% at 2 years after kidney transplantation, whereas the proportion of those with low bone turnover increased from 26% to 52%. Of 19 participants remaining on dialysis after 2 years, 13 underwent successful repeat biopsy. The proportion of patients remaining on dialysis with high bone turnover decreased from 69% to 31%, and low bone turnover increased from 8% to 38%. Abnormal bone mineralization increased in transplant recipients from 33% to 44%, but decreased in patients remaining on dialysis from 46% to 15%. Trabecular bone volume showed little change after transplantation, but low bone volume increased in patients remaining on dialysis. Bone mineral density did not correlate with histomorphometric findings. CONCLUSIONS: Bone turnover decreased over time both in patients remaining on dialysis and in kidney transplant recipients. Bone mineral density and bone biomarkers were not associated with bone metabolism changes detected in bone biopsy specimens.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When auriculoplasty is performed for microtia, wire often becomes exposed during the long postoperative period. We have investigated other materials for fixing cartilage. We previously reported that absorbable sutures are more appropriate than wire. The present animal experiments investigated the reasons why fixation of transplanted cartilage is maintained when using absorbable sutures. METHODS: The costal cartilages of Sprague-Dawley rats were harvested, and three cartilage transplant models were prepared. After bending a costal cartilage into a U-shape, it was fixed by using only absorbable sutures as the control or was fixed by suturing one or two cross struts of cartilage to the U-shaped graft. Then the cartilages were subcutaneously transplanted into the backs of the rats. They were removed 8 weeks later, and the return rate of the bent cartilages was assessed. RESULTS: The return rate was 74.0%, in the suture-only group (control), 27.9% in the one-strut group, and 8.3% in the two-strut group. When the sites of contact between the U-shaped graft and the cartilage struts were observed by light microscopy, adhesion of the two cartilages by fibrous connective tissue was observed. CONCLUSION: U-shaped cartilage grafts demonstrated a smaller return rate when there was a larger contact area with the cartilage struts. Each strut was fixed by fibrous connective tissue at the contact site, thereby maintaining the shape of the graft. Thus, when creating a cartilage framework, it is important to fix the bent cartilage to the cartilage struts with a sufficiently large contact area.",

Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at obtaining a comprehensive overview of existing evidence. METHODS: A search in the following databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Academic Search Complete, ERIC, HealthSource: Nursing/Academic Edition and MEDLINE, resulted in k = 31 original studies included in the systematic review (total N = 99,192) and k = 17 (total N = 27,443) included in the meta-analysis. Main inclusion criteria referred to testing the SB--anxiety relationship, the quality score (above the threshold of 65%), and the language of publications (English). The study was following the PRISMA statement and was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017068517). RESULTS: Both the systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that overall average effects were small: higher levels of symptoms of anxiety were associated with higher levels of SB (weighted r = .093, 95% CI [.055, .130], p < .001). Moderator analyses indicated that trends for stronger effects were observed among adults, compared to children/adolescents (p = .085). CONCLUSIONS: Further longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate the predictive direction of the anxiety-SB relationship and to clarify whether the effects depend on the type of anxiety indicators.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with sexual dysfunction in breastfeeding women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytical study. SETTING: Population-based study of individuals living in the northeast region of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: From May to August 2017, 372 women aged >/=18 years were selected who gave exclusive, predominant or complementary breast feeding up to 23 months postpartum, and who did not have contraindications for the resumption of intercourse. Pregnant women, those diagnosed with mental health problems, users of medications that affect sexual function (antihypertensives, antidepressants or antipsychotics) and women unable to read or understand the instructions for the study were excluded. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The breastfeeding women completed the Female Sexual Function Index, the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index and a questionnaire to collect participants' sociodemographic, clinical and interpersonal data. A bivariate analysis was performed, and variables with p values<0.20 were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Sexual dysfunction was present in 58.3% of the study population. Factors significantly associated with female sexual dysfunction (FSD) included placing a low importance on sexual intercourse (adjusted OR [AOR]=2.49, 95% CI=1.22 to 5.09), limited communication with the partner (AOR=2.64, 95% CI=1.43 to 4.86), decreased frequency of sexual intercourse (AOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.30 to 3.61) and low quality of life (AOR=2.23, 95% CI=1.33 to 3.74). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FSD appears with a great magnitude in breastfeeding women. The risk factors for sexual dysfunction are biopsychosocial and these findings may lead to improved counselling for prenatal and postnatal care.",

There is great interest in these methods for metabolomic, environmental, forensic, and food safety applications, among others, to determine compounds that are responsible for a particular disease state or the presence of a harmful compound. In order for non-targeted analyses to become standardized and routine, best practices for sample preparation, data collection, and data analysis must be determined. This work focuses on optimizing specific aspects of a non-targeted workflow that utilizes high-resolution mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap instrument coupled to liquid chromatography. Sample preparation, liquid chromatography gradient length, and mass spectrometry resolving power and ionization modes were investigated to determine optimal conditions for detecting and extracting compounds from the data that cover broad molecular and polarity ranges. Infant rice cereal, orange juice, and yogurt with spiked standards were analyzed; food is inherently challenging to analyze due in part to sample complexity and diversity. Of the conditions tested, optimal conditions included a generic sample extraction using acetonitrile, water, and formic acid, a 25\u202fmin chromatographic gradient, collecting data in both positive and negative ion modes, and using 70\u202fk resolving power. There are of course tradeoffs associated with each of these options that will be described in detail so that the appropriate conditions can be chosen for the desired application.",

In addition, the case presented here is placed in context with an associated comprehensive, evidence-based review of the use of gadolinium in interventional pain procedures, addressing gadolinium chemistry and pharmacologic properties, neurotoxicity and radiology. Physicians must be aware that gadolinium poses a significant risk of acute neurotoxicity even in small doses.

        "abstract": "Glycogen phosphorylase enzymes (GP) catalyse reversible reactions; the glucose transfer from glycogen to inorganic phosphate (P(i), phosphorolysis) or the reverse glucose transfer from glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) to glycogen (synthesis). Rabbit muscle GPb (rmGPb) was used as a model enzyme to study the reversible enzyme reaction. To follow both directions of this reversible reaction, we have developed a novel isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method for the determination of the direct reaction rate. The preference of forward or reverse reaction was ensured by the 0.1 or 10 concentration ratios of G-1-P/P(i), respectively. Substrate specificity was studied using different maltooligosaccharides and glycogen. Based on the K(M) values, glycogen and 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl maltoheptaoside (CNP-G7) were found to be analogous substrates, which allowed to optimize the method by taking advantage of the CNP chromophore being detectable in HPLC. In case of CNP-G7, substrate inhibition was observed and characterised by K(i) of 23\u202f+/-\u202f7\u202fmM. Inhibition of human GP is a promising strategy for the treatment of diabetes. Our ITC measurements have confirmed that caffeine and glucopyranosylidene-spiro-thiohydantoin (GTH), as known GPb inhibitors, inhibit the rmGPb-catalysed reversible reaction in both directions. K(i) values obtained in the direction of synthesis (1.92\u202f+/-\u202f0.14\u202fmM for caffeine and 11.5\u202f+/-\u202f2.0\u202fmuM for GTH) have been shown to be in good agreement with the K(i) values obtained in the direction of phosphorolysis (4.05\u202f+/-\u202f0.26\u202fmM for caffeine and 13.8\u202f+/-\u202f1.6\u202fmuM for GTH). The higher difference between the inhibition constants of caffeine was explained by the non-competitive mechanism. The described ITC method using the developed experimental design and reaction conditions is suitable for activity measurements of different phosphorylase enzymes on various substrates and is applicable for inhibition studies as well.",

Although micro- and macroparasites may exert different selective pressures on their hosts, studies investigating the determinants of parasite species richness in animals have rarely considered this divide. Here, we investigated the role of host life history and ecology in explaining the species richness of helminths (macroparasites) and haemosporidians (microparasites) in birds world-wide. We collated data from multiple global datasets on diverse bird traits (longevity, body mass, coloniality, migration distance/tendency, geographic range size and dietary and habitat breadths) and the species richness of their helminth and haemosporidian parasites. We tested predictors of helminth and haemosporidian parasite richness using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework. We found that, after controlling for research effort and host phylogeny, the richness of helminths, but not of haemosporidians, increased with host longevity, range size, migration distance and dietary breadth. Overall, these correlates were also important across different helminth groups (acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes and trematodes), and two additional ones (body mass, coloniality) emerged as important for cestodes and acanthocephalans. We propose that long life spans may promote the diversity of helminth parasite assemblages over evolutionary time, thus resulting in richer helminth faunas. Similarly, longer-distance migrations, larger ranges and broader dietary breadths are likely to lead to greater encounter rates and the accumulation of trophically transmitted helminths. In contrast, vector-borne haemosporidians may be influenced more by factors related to vector ecology than by the host traits included in the analyses. The lack of strong associations between haemosporidian species richness and host characteristics emphasizes the need to find appropriate traits to model the distribution and diversity of parasites with different environmental preferences in order to anticipate disease emergence risks associated with global change.",

Sixty-four lambs from Santa Ines (SI) and crossbred Dorper x Santa Ines (DSI) were slaughtered. The carcasses were refrigerated at 4  degrees C for 24 h, and half of the right side carcass was divided into five primary cuts, which were then dissected into bone, muscle, and fat. The corrected cold carcass weight (CCWc) was calculated based on the sum of the cuts. There was no effect of the interactions evaluated (P > 0.05) among the factors tested. CCWc, muscle (kg), fat (kg), bone (%), M:F, M:B, F:B, and M+F:B were influenced by the lambs' genetic group (P < 0.05). An effect of body weight at the beginning of confinement was found only for CCWc, muscle (kg), fat (kg), bone (kg), bone (%), and M:F. The crossbreeding of Santa Ines with breeds Dorper promotes improvements in the qualitative characteristics of the carcass. To obtain better relationships of the quantitative characteristics of the carcass, of sheep introduced in confinements with larger weights, the slaughter weight must be adjusted to that initial weight.",

This was done in light of the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) that has been highlighted by some studies, showing an increased incidence of bladder cancer, particularly with use of empagliflozin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Medline and Embase search for \"Canaglifozin\", \"Dapaglifozin\", \"Empaglifozin\", \"Ertuglifozin\", \"Ipraglifozin\", Tofoglifozin\" or \"Luseoglifozin\" was performed, identifying randomized trials with a duration of more than 52 weeks up to 1 December 2018 that compared SGLT-2is with placebo or active comparators. The outcomes considered were all types of cancer and several site-specific cancers (ie, breast, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, skin, prostate and bladder). Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (MH-OR, 95% CI) were calculated for all outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 27 trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Retrieved trials had enrolled 27 744 and 20 441 patients in SGLT-2 inhibitor and comparator groups, respectively. No difference was observed in the incidence of all malignancies between patients allocated to SGLT-2i and comparators (MH-OR 0.98[0.77-1.24]). The incidence of bladder cancer, and of any other type of cancer, was not significantly increased by treatment with any SGLT-2i. CONCLUSIONS: Available data from randomized trials do not suggest a detrimental effect of SGLT-2is on the incidence of malignancies in general, or in bladder cancer in particular.",

        "abstract": "Isotactic polypropylene (iPP) is a commonly used thermoplastic polymer with many excellent properties. But high brittleness, especially at low temperatures, limits the use of iPP. The presence of transcrystallization of iPP makes it possible for fiber-reinforced iPP composites with higher strength. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a kind of cellulose with great potential to be used as a new filler to reinforce iPP due to its high crystallinity, biodegradability and efficient mechanical properties. In this study, the iPP/BC hamburger composite was prepared by a simple hot press and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) was used to improve the interface compatibility of iPP and BC. The polarizing microscope (POM) photograph shows that BC successfully induces the transcrystallization of iPP. The differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) date proves that the addition of BC could improve the thermal properties and crystallization rate of the composite. Especially, this change is more obvious of the iPP/MAPP/BC. The mechanical properties of the iPP/BC composites were greatly increased. This DSC date is higher than BC; we used BC particles to enhance the iPP in our previous research. The scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis intuitively shows that the interface of the iPP/MAPP/BC is more smooth and flat than the iPP/BC. The fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of the iPP/BC hamburger composites was shown that a new C=O group vibration appeared at 1743 cm(-1), which indicated that the hydrogen bond structure of BC molecules was weakened and some hydroxyl groups were substituted after modification which can increase the lipophilicity of BC. These results indicated that the BC fiber can easily induce the transcrystallization of iPP, which has excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, the addition of MAPP contributes greatly to the interface compatibility of iPP and BC.",

Gene-Ontology-enrichment and KEGG-pathway analysis were used for evaluating the biological functions of differentially-expressed genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were employed to assess the prognostic values of hub genes. RESULTS: A total of 1,486 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 13 up-regulated and 1,473 down-regulated genes. KEGG pathways such as metabolic pathways, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and pathways in cancer were significantly represented. In the PPI network, the top ten hub genes ranked by degree were GNG7, PLCB1, CALML5, FGFR4, GRB2, JAK3, ADCY7, ADCY9, GNAS and KDR. Five DEGs, including ANTXR1, EFNA5, GAMT, E2F2 and NRCAM, were associated with relapse-free survival and overall survival.

Lower mortality rates have been reported in admixed populations compared to European origin populations.

Annual mortality cause registers were searched to determine ALS deaths from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses in Ecuador (INEC) from 1990 to 2016. Mid-year population was considered for each year. The time trend was assessed using a negative binomial regression. Rate ratio statistics were performed to compare the age and sex standardized rates based on the 2010 US population among ethnic groups. Overall, 570 ALS deaths were identified. ALS mortality showed an age-related profile with a peak between 55 and 70 years. After age-sex standardization on the 2010 US population, mortality rate was 0.33 (CI 0.30-0.36) per 100,000. The time trend showed an increase of ALS mortality (p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in age-sex standardized mortality rates per 100,000 when admixed was compared to white (p = 0.231) and black (p = 0.125). Differences reached statistical significance between admixed and other ethnics (p = 0.015).

        "abstract": "Organic solvents are widely used in a variety of industrial sectors. Reclaiming and reusing the solvents may be the most economically and environmentally beneficial option for managing spent solvents. Purifying the solvents to meet reuse specifications can be challenging. For hydrophilic solvents, water must be removed prior to reuse, yet many hydrophilic solvents form hard-to-separate azeotropic mixtures with water. Such mixtures make separation processes energy intensive and cause economic challenges. The membrane processes pervaporation (PV) and vapor permeation (VP) can be less energy intensive than distillation-based processes and have proven to be very effective in removing water from azeotropic mixtures. In PV/VP, separation is based on the solution-diffusion interaction between the dense permselective layer of the membrane and the solvent/water mixture. This review provides a state-of-the-science analysis of materials used as the selective layer(s) of PV/VP membranes in removing water from organic solvents. A variety of membrane materials, such as polymeric, inorganic, mixed matrix, and hybrid, have been reported in the literature. A small subset of these are commercially available and highlighted here: poly(vinyl alcohol), polyimides, amorphous perfluoro polymers, NaA zeolites, chabazite zeolites, T-type zeolites, and hybrid silicas. The typical performance characteristics and operating limits of these membranes are discussed. Solvents targeted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for reclamation are emphasized and ten common solvents are chosen for analysis: acetonitrile, 1-butanol, N,N-dimethyl formamide, ethanol, methanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and 2-propanol.",

Cryopreservation medium was supplemented with purified seminal plasma transferrin (Tf), bovine serum albumin (BSA) or antifreeze protein (AFP) Types I and III. Concentration of proteins evaluated was 0.1 mug/ml, 1 mug/ml, and 10 mug/ml. Motility and curvilinear velocity of spermatozoa was evaluated by the Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer (CASA). The percent of motile cells and spermatozoa curvilinear velocity of frozen-thawed sperm with supplementation of Tf and AFP III at all concentrations were greater compared to samples with no added proteins. The protective effect of BSA and AFP I was less and dose-dependent. Thus, it is concluded that incorporation of Tf in the extender before freezing improves crypreservation of common carp spermatozoa whereas supplementation with AFP III in greater concentrations was more effective.",

Recent studies implicate gene expression changes in immune function to be associated with GWI. Since DNA methylation can regulate such changes in gene expression, and disruption of DNA methylation pattern is implicated in various immune and neurological diseases, we aimed to study the DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from GWI patients. Global DNA methylation levels were similar in GWI patients and controls. However, the genome-wide microarray technology detected 10,767 differentially methylated CpG sites across gene regulatory elements and within coding regions. Approximately 88% of them were hypermethylated in GWI patients. The separate analysis found 776 differentially methylated gene promoters (DMP), which were predominantly hypermethylated. Pyrosequencing validation confirmed microarray results. Functional analysis revealed that majority of the DMPs belonged to genes responsible for metabolism and immune system. This is the first pilot human study characterizing genome-wide epigenetic changes associated with GWI. It suggests a significant contribution of epigenetic dysfunction in GWI. Moreover, it supports the dysregulation of immune function in GWI. Lastly, it suggests studies with the larger cohort to validate our findings.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive attention to threat. Several brain areas, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), have been associated with threat processing, with more recent work implicating specialized roles for the medial and lateral subregions of the OFC in mediating specific symptoms of anxiety disorders. Virtually no causal work, however, has evaluated the role of these OFC subregions in regulating behavioral responses under threat. To address this gap, we compared male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with bilateral excitotoxic lesions restricted to either the lateral OFC (lOFC), targeting Walker's areas 11 and 13, or the medial OFC (mOFC), targeting Walker's area 14, to a group of unoperated controls on behavioral responses to the presentation of a fake rubber snake, fake spider, and neutral stimuli. Both lesion groups showed heightened defensive and reduced approach responses, accompanied by longer latencies to retrieve a food reward, in the presence of the threatening stimuli. Compared to unoperated controls, the mOFC lesion group also showed longer latencies to reach for rewards and a greater proportion of defensive responses (e.g., piloerection) in the presence of neutral stimuli. Thus, monkeys with mOFC lesions displayed a greater tendency to express defensive responses even in the absence of threat. Overall, our data reveal that both the mOFC and lOFC contribute to the attenuation of defensive responses. Notably, these findings, obtained following selective, excitotoxic lesions of the OFC, are diametrically opposed to the effects of aspiration lesions of OFC observed in macaques.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Engaging in adaptive defensive responses under threat promotes biological fitness. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in regulating defensive responses to threat, with distinct subregions likely playing different roles. Here we tested the effects of excitotoxic damage restricted to either the lateral or medial subdivisions of the OFC in rhesus macaques. We found significantly heightened defense and reduced approach responses to threatening stimuli in both lesion groups. While lateral OFC lesions led to an increase in defense responses to the threatening stimuli, medial OFC lesions produced increases in defense responses to both threatening and neutral stimuli. Our findings provide insights into the neural regulation of defensive responses to threat and inform the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders in humans.",

        "abstract": "Background: Approximately 3 billion people, worldwide, rely primarily on biomass for cooking. This study aimed to investigate the association between respiratory symptoms among women in charge of household cooking and the type of fuel used for cooking. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted. A total of 1705 women that were randomly selected, completed the survey. We also performed a bivariate and a multivariate analysis to verify the possible associations between respiratory symptoms in women in charge of household cooking and the type of cooking fuel used. Results: Dry cough, breathing difficulties, and throat irritation frequencies were statistically high in biomass fuel users when compared to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) users. It was also the case for some chronic respiratory symptoms, such as sputum production, shortness of breath, wheezing, wheezing with dyspnea, wheezing without a cold, waking up with shortness of breath, waking up with coughing attacks, and waking up with breathing difficulty. After adjustment for the respondents' and households' characteristics; dry cough, breathing difficulties, sneezing, nose tingling, throat irritation, chronic sputum production, wheezing, wheezing with dyspnea, wheezing without a cold, waking up with shortness of breath, waking up with coughing attacks, and waking up with breathing difficulty were symptoms that remained associated to biomass fuel compared to LPG. Women who used charcoal reported the highest proportion of all the chronic respiratory symptoms compared to the firewood users. However, this difference was not statistically significant except for the wheezing, waking up with coughing attacks, and waking up with breath difficulty, after adjustment. Conclusion: Exposure to biomass smoke is responsible for respiratory health problems in women. Charcoal, which is often considered as a clean fuel compared to other biomass fuels and often recommended as an alternative to firewood, also presents health risks, including increased respiratory morbidity in women. Effective and efficient energy policies are needed to accelerate the transition to clean and sustainable energies.",

        "abstract": "There is debate in the literature whether rotating hinge knee (RHK) or constrained condylar knee (CCK) prostheses lead to better clinical outcomes and survival rates in patients undergoing revision total knee arthroplasty (RTKA). The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the survivorship and clinical outcomes of RHK and CCK prostheses. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed studies that evaluated pain and function scores, range of motion (ROM), complications, and survival rates in patients treated with RHK or CCK with short-term (<5 years) or midterm (5-10 years) follow-up. The survivorship was considered as the time to additional surgical intervention such as removal or revision of the components. A total of 12 studies (one randomized study and 11 non-randomized studies) met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The proportion of the knees in which short-term (<5 years) survival rates (RHK, 83/95; CCK, 111/148; odds ratio [OR] 0.52; 95% CI, 0.24-1.11; P = 0.09) and midterm (5-10 years) survival rates (RHK, 104/128; CCK, 196/234; OR 1.05; 95% CI, 0.56-1.97; P = 0.88) were evaluated did not differ significantly between RHK and CCK prostheses. In addition, there were no significant differences in ROM (95% CI: -0.40 to 9.93; P = 0.07) and complication rates (95% CI: 0.66 to 2.49; P = 0.46). In contrast, CCK groups reported significantly better pain score (95% CI: 0.50 to 2.73; P = 0.005) and function score (95% CI: 0.01 to 2.00; P = 0.05) than RHK groups. This meta-analysis revealed that 87.4% of RHK and 75.0% of CCK prostheses survive at short-term (<5 years), while 81.3% of RHK and 83.8% of CCK prostheses survive at midterm (5-10 years). The differences in standardized mean pain and function scores we detected were likely to be imperceptible to patients and almost certainly below the minimum clinically important level, despite a significant difference in both groups. Based on the findings of the current meta-analysis, RHK prostheses continue to be an option in complex RTKA with reasonable midterm survivorship."

Multiphasic scaffolds, where different layers model different microenvironments, are a promising treatment approach, yet stable joining between layers during fabrication remains challenging. Here, a bilayer scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration was fabricated using thermally-induced phase separation (TIPS). Two distinct polymer solutions were layered before TIPS, and the resulting porous, bilayer scaffold was characterized by seamless interfacial integration and a mechanical stiffness gradient reflecting the native osteochondral microenvironment. Chitosan is a critical component of both scaffold layers to facilitate cell attachment and the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes with other biologically relevant natural polymers. The articular cartilage region was optimized for hyaluronic acid content and stiffness, while the subchondral bone region was defined by higher stiffness and osteoconductive hydroxyapatite content. Following co-culture with chondrocyte-like (SW-1353 or mesenchymal stem cells) and osteoblast-like cells (MG63), cell proliferation and migration to the interface along with increased gene expression associated with relevant markers of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis indicates the potential of this bilayer scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Dark-adapted visual fields were obtained from patients with inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) and controls to evaluate the effect that age, retinal region, and disease had on scotopic sensitivity. Intra- and intersession test-retest repeatabilities for patients and controls were measured to establish significant change for longitudinal studies. METHODS: A total of 41 patients with IRD and 30 controls had one eye dilated and dark-adapted for 40 minutes. Scotopic sensitivity was measured with a Medmont dark-adapted chromatic (DAC) perimeter (size V stimulus, 200-ms duration, background luminance < 0.0001 cd/m2, dynamic range 0-75 decibel [dB]). Mixed effects analysis was performed to analyze age, retinal eccentricity, and sensitivity. The intra-/intersession coefficients of repeatability (CR) were calculated for controls and patients with IRD. RESULTS: Each additional year was associated with lower sensitivity (-0.22 dB) per year in normal controls over age 50 compared to younger controls (12-49 years). The superior field had lower sensitivity than the inferior, but the nasal field was not different compared to the temporal field in normal controls. The CR for intra- and intersession testing on mean sensitivity (MS)/pointwise sensitivity (PWS) were +/-1.5/+/-8.5 and +/-3.3/+/-9.8 dB, respectively, for patients with IRD. Control MS/PWS CR were +/-1.5/+/-6.1 dB for intrasession and +/-1.7/+/-6.8 dB for intersession DAC perimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The DAC perimeter is an important asset because it tests a wide field of scotopic vision. The CR are comparable to those of other perimetry devices. Effects of age and retinal region should be considered when assessing scotopic sensitivity measured with the DAC perimeter.",

Black garlic is produced from garlic by heat treatment and its anti-inflammatory activity has been previously reported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of five different extracts of black garlic against carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced acute hepatic injury (AHI). In this study, mice in the control, CCl(4), silymarin, and black garlic groups were orally administered distilled water, silymarin, and different fraction extracts of black garlic, respectively, after CCl(4) was injected intraperitoneally to induce AHI. The results revealed that the n-butanol layer extract (BA) and water layer extract (WS) demonstrated a hepatoprotective effect by reducing the levels of alanine aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, the BA and WS fractions of black garlic extract increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and the interleukin-1 (IL-1beta) level in liver. It was concluded that black garlic exhibited significant protective effects on CCl(4)-induced acute hepatic injury.",

        "abstract": "The shape and contour of the lesion are shown to be effective features for physicians to identify breast tumor as benign or malignant. The region of the lesion is usually manually created by the physician according to their clinical experience; therefore, contouring tumors on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is difficult and time-consuming. For this purpose, an automatic contouring method for breast tumors was developed for less burden in the analysis and to decrease the observed bias to help in making decisions clinically. In this study, a multiview segmentation method for detecting and contouring breast tumors in MRI was represented. The preprocessing of the proposed method reduces any amount of noises but preserves the shape and contrast of the breast tumor. The two-dimensional (2D) level-set segmentation method extracts contours of breast tumors from the transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes. The obtained contours are further utilized to generate appropriate three-dimensional (3D) contours. Twenty breast tumor cases were evaluated and the simulation results show that the proposed contouring method was an efficient method for delineating 3D contours of breast tumors in MRI.",

The aim of this study was to compare experimentally five DCBs in terms of distal embolism of PTX. METHODS: Twenty-five New Zealand rabbits were divided into five groups according to the DCB used: Lutonix (Bard), In.Pact (Medtronic), Passeo-18 Lux (Biotronik), Ranger (Boston Scientific), and Stellarex (Spectranetics) (n = 5 in each group). After ligation of the right common iliac artery, a 4 x 40 mm DCB was inflated in the infrarenal aorta for 180 seconds. Rabbits were euthanised two hours after inflation of the DCB. The infrarenal aorta, a blood sample and three left hind leg muscles (tensor fasciae latae [TFL], vastus lateralis [VL], and tibialis anterior [TA] muscles) were harvested for blind measurement of PTX concentrations and histological analysis (PTX emboli count). RESULTS: In the TA muscle (the most distal), concentrations of PTX were significantly lower for the Ranger (0.067 ng/mg) than for the Lutonix (0.342 ng/mg; p = .008), In.Pact (0.370 ng/mg; p = .012), and Passeo-18-Lux (0.160 ng/mg; p = .021) DCBs. Similarly, concentrations of PTX were significantly lower for the Passeo-18-Lux than for the In.Pact (p = .028). Concentrations of PTX were not significantly different between DCBs in the TFL and VL muscles. Concentrations of PTX were found to be significantly higher in the plasma and lower in the aorta and on the DCBs after use of Lutonix compared with the four other DCBs. Histological analysis revealed evidence of embolised PTX crystals in small arterioles of all muscle tissue samples without any significant difference between the DCBs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests some differences regarding distal embolisation profiles between the five assessed DCBs. Although clinical implications remain to be demonstrated, the present results may have implications when choosing a DCB, especially in a critical limb ischaemia setting.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of accidental hypothermia (core temperature </=35  degrees C) is difficult to estimate, as the affected population is heterogeneous. Both temperature and clinical presentation should be considered while determining severity, which is difficult in a prehospital setting. Extracorporeal rewarming is advocated for all Swiss Staging System class IV (hypothermic cardiac arrest) and class III (hypothermic cardiac instability) patients. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the method of choice, as it not only allows a gradual, controlled increase of core body temperature, but also provides respiratory and hemodynamic support during the unstable period of rewarming and reperfusion. This poses difficulties with the coordination of patient management, as usually only cardiac referral centers can deliver such advanced treatment. Further special considerations apply to subgroups of patients, including drowning or avalanche victims. The principle of ECMO implantation in severely hypothermic patients is no different from any other indication, although establishing vascular access in a timely manner during ongoing resuscitation and maintaining adequate flow may require modification of the operating technique, as well as aggressive fluid resuscitation. Further studies are needed in order to determine the optimal rewarming rate and flow that would favor brain and lung protection. Recent analysis shows an overall survival rate of 40.3%, while additional prognostic factors are being sought for determining those patients in whom the treatment is futile. New cannulas, along with ready-to-use ECMO sets, are being developed that would enable easy, safe and efficient out-reach ECMO implantation, thus shortening resuscitation times. Moreover, national guidelines for the management of accidental hypothermia are needed in order that all patients that would benefit from extracorporeal rewarming would be provided with such treatment. In this perspective article, we discuss burning problems in ECMO therapy in hypothermic patients, outlining the important research goals to improve the outcomes.",

There is evidence suggesting negative links between exposure to environmental toxicants and negative physical health outcomes (i.e. asthma, allergies) in children. However, research on children's exposure to environmental toxicants and other developmental outcomes (cognitive, socioemotional) is limited. Objectives The goal of the current review was to assess the existing literature on the links between environmental toxicants (excluding heavy metals) and children's cognitive, socioemotional, and behavioral development among young children. Methods This literature review highlights research on environmental toxicants (i.e. pesticide exposure, bisphenol A, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco smoke, polychlorinated biphenyls, flame retardants, phthalates and gas pollutions) and children's development across multiple domains. Results The results highlight the potential risk of exposure to multiple environmental toxicants for young children's cognitive and socioemotional development. Discussion Discussion will focus on the role of environmental toxicants in the cognitive and socioemotional development of young children, while highlighting gaps in the existing literature.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for adding parallax and real-time playback of 360 degrees  videos in Virtual Reality headsets. In current video players, the playback does not respond to translational head movement, which reduces the feeling of immersion, and causes motion sickness for some viewers. Given a 360 degrees  video and its corresponding depth (provided by current stereo 360 degrees  stitching algorithms), a naive image-based rendering approach would use the depth to generate a 3D mesh around the viewer, then translate it appropriately as the viewer moves their head. However, this approach breaks at depth discontinuities, showing visible distortions, whereas cutting the mesh at such discontinuities leads to ragged silhouettes and holes at disocclusions. We address these issues by improving the given initial depth map to yield cleaner, more natural silhouettes. We rely on a three-layer scene representation, made up of a foreground layer and two static background layers, to handle disocclusions by propagating information from multiple frames for the first background layer, and then inpainting for the second one. Our system works with input from many of today's most popular 360 degrees  stereo capture devices (e.g., Yi Halo or GoPro Odyssey), and works well even if the original video does not provide depth information. Our user studies confirm that our method provides a more compelling viewing experience than without parallax, increasing immersion while reducing discomfort and nausea.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To compare dyad (training in pairs without an instructor) with resource-intensive instructor-led training for laypersons' paediatric resuscitation skills in a non-inferiority trial and examine cost-effectiveness of the training methods. METHODS: In this randomised parallel group non-inferiority trial, 155 dyad and 175 instructor-led laypersons were trained in Basic Life Support and Foreign Body Airway Obstruction Management. Dyads were given instructional videos, hands-on exercises and provided feedback to their partner for 50 min. Instructor-led laypersons trained in groups of six for two hours. Learning were assessed in scenarios immediately after training and, subsequently, at 14 days, 1, and 3 months. Pass rates, cost-effectiveness of producing a competent layperson (passing both tests), and non-inferiority were analysed. RESULTS: Sixty-eight (45.6%) dyad and 130 (74.3%) instructor-led laypersons passed the basic life support test (p < 0.001). For Foreign Body Airway Obstruction Management 77 (54.2%) dyad and 130 (79.3%) for instructor-led laypersons passed (p < 0.001). Skills decreased over three months for both groups. Forty-two (30.4%) dyad and ninety-eight (59.8%) for instructor-led laypersons were competent after training (p < 0.001). The lower effectiveness of dyad training had reduced costs (p < 0.001). For each 10,000 USD allocated to training, dyad training would result in 71 vs. 65 competent laypersons for instructor-led training. Non-inferiority of dyad training could not be established. CONCLUSION: Instructor-led training was the most effective but also the most expensive training method, making it less cost-effective than dyad training. When the aim is to train for quantity rather than quality, dyad training would be the preferred choice of training method.",

In recent years, small molecule inhibitors, many of which are used in cancer therapy, have emerged as valuable future prospects in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Inhibitors of PGD2, JAK, Syk, and C5a all have, to some extent, theorized efficacy in the treatment of chronic skin conditions, and multiple clinical trials are ongoing.

In this regard, Lacan's reception of the \"linguistic turn\" is considered in the programmatic text that opens his Seminar: \"The function and field of speech and language in psychoanalysis.\" In this text the impasse and ambiguities signaled by Sigmund Freud about how to understand the traumatic (is it something interior or exterior?) were resolved. The new perspective, laid open by the application of the \"linguistic turn\" to the idea of trauma, also modifies what we conceive as the localization of the unconscious (as something more exterior than interior) and what might be understood as the analyst's position during the treatment as well.",

A previous study found that later sleep timing was associated with depressive symptoms in women but not men. To date, however, no research has investigated whether the association between social jetlag and depression varies by sex among adolescents. The current study assessed self-reported sleep, depressive symptoms, and demographic information from 3058 adolescents (48% female, mean [SD] age 15.59 [0.77] years) from the age 15 wave of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). Social jetlag was calculated as the absolute value of the midpoint of sleep on the weekend minus the midpoint of sleep during the school week. Depressive symptoms were measured through a modified 5-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). We assessed whether the associations among sleep duration on school nights, social jetlag, and depressive symptoms were similar between male and female adolescents using multiple linear regression. In fully adjusted models, sex moderated the association between school night total sleep time and depressive symptoms ( p < 0.001) and between social jetlag and depressive symptoms ( p = 0.037). In females, but not in males, school night total sleep time was negatively associated with depressive symptoms ( p < 0.001), whereas social jetlag ( p < 0.001) was positively and independently associated with depressive symptoms. The results indicate the importance of regular sleep timing across the week and adequate sleep duration for the maintenance of optimal emotional health among female adolescents.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thirdhand smoke (THS) pollutants, such as nicotine, accumulate on the hands of children who live in homes with smokers and are exposed to secondhand smoke. Our objective was to examine whether levels of hand nicotine in exposed children are associated with demographics, environmental factors, and clinical findings. METHODS: Participants were caregivers who smoke and children (mean age (SD) = 2.6 (3.7) years) who were part of an ongoing 2-group, randomized controlled trial of an emergency department-based tobacco cessation intervention (N = 104). The primary outcome measure was nicotine on the child's hand. Caregivers reported demographics and smoking patterns; children's medical records were abstracted for chief complaint, medical history, and diagnoses. RESULTS: All children had detectable hand nicotine (geometric mean [GeoM] = 86.2 ng/wipe; range = 3.5-2, 190.4 ng/wipe). Children in the age group of 2 to 4 years old (GeoM = 185.6 ng/wipe) had higher levels than the children in the age groups of 0 to 1 (GeoM = 68.9 ng/wipe, P < .001), 5 to 9 (GeoM = 77.9 ng/wipe, P = .04), and 10 to 15 years old (GeoM = 74.2 ng/wipe, P = .048). Children whose caregivers smoked 6 to 14 (GeoM = 97.2 ng/wipe, P = .047) and 15 to 40 cigarettes/day (GeoM = 124.0 ng/wipe, P = .01) had higher levels than children whose caregivers smoked 1 to 5 cigarettes/day (GeoM = 59.7 ng/wipe). Children with 6 to 14 cigarettes/day (GeoM = 163.11 ng/wipe, P = .007) and 15 to 40 cigarettes/day (GeoM = 186.1, P = .003) smoked inside the home by all smokers had significantly higher levels than homes with 0 cigarettes (GeoM = 81.3 ng/wipe). Similar differences in hand nicotine levels were found for smoking frequency of all household members in any location. Children with complaints of cough/congestion (GeoM = 97.7 ng/wipe) had higher levels than those without cough/congestion (GeoM = 59.0 ng/wipe, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The high hand nicotine levels in children whose caregivers do not necessarily smoke indoor demonstrate that indoor smoking bans do not safeguard against THS exposure and the associations with increased home smoking activity indicate that hand wipes may be a noninvasive way to characterize children's exposure. The findings of associated cough and congestion with higher THS levels need to be examined further.",

        "abstract": "Non-genetic factors are crucial in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), a disease caused by autoimmunity against insulin-producing beta-cells. Exposure to medications in the prenatal period may influence the immune system maturation, thus altering self-tolerance. Prenatal administration of betamethasone -a synthetic glucocorticoid given to women at risk of preterm delivery- may affect the development of T1D. It has been previously demonstrated that prenatal betamethasone administration protects offspring from T1D development in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. The direct effect of betamethasone on the immature and mature immune system of NOD mice and on target beta-cells is analysed in this paper. In vitro, betamethasone decreased lymphocyte viability and induced maturation-resistant dendritic cells, which in turn impaired gammadelta T cell proliferation and decreased IL-17 production. Prenatal betamethasone exposure caused thymus hypotrophy in newborn mice as well as alterations in immune cells subsets. Furthermore, betamethasone decreased beta-cell growth, reduced C-peptide secretion and altered the expression of genes related to autoimmunity, metabolism and islet mass in T1D target tissue. These results support the protection against T1D in the betamethasone-treated offspring and demonstrate that this drug alters the developing immune system and beta-cells. Understanding how betamethasone generates self-tolerance could have potential clinical relevance in T1D.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to validate a new method to detect the degree of correlation between simulated and real tilted blade implants as they appear on a single two-dimensional radiograph. METHODS: The angular correction factor (CF;) was defined as the coupling of two subsequent angle transformations, a set of five angular values describing the theoretical radiographic appearance of the blade implant: (1) three consecutive rotations about the axes of the blade ([Formula: see text], theta, and psi, standing for pitch, roll, and yaw, respectively) to represent the polarization directions; (2) a two-dimensional projection defined by two angles (lambda and [Formula: see text], respectively, longitude and latitude) to represent the vector of the X-ray beam intersecting the detector plate. Data of patients who received fixed prostheses supported by blade-form implants were employed to calculate a dimensional correction factor (CF degrees ), a specific length through the major axis. The simulation of a distorted radiograph of a blade positioned in space was compared with the real radiograph. Differences in the angular measurements served as an initial test to assess the effectiveness of the method. RESULTS: In the acquired sets of periapical radiographs, mean misalignments of + 3.58 degrees  in longitude and - 0.04 degrees  in latitude were registered. The following variations were detected during the accuracy testing: the absolute error was 0.1 +/- 7.5 degrees  for angle [Formula: see text]; 2.4 +/- 6.7 degrees  for angle theta; - 1.0 +/- 3.7 degrees  for angle psi; 4.5 +/- 8.6 degrees  for angle lambda; and 2.0 +/- 9.3 degrees  for angle [Formula: see text]. The linear dependence between CF degrees  and CF; was estimated by a robust linear regression: slope + 0.991, intercept + 0.007, and adjusted R(2) 0.992. CONCLUSIONS: This a posteriori analysis introduces the explicit trigonometric equations of the theoretical standard (CF;) used to describe the blade implant radiographic position and misalignment on two-dimensional radiographs.",

This retrospective study included 928 consecutive patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI in 2 institutions, from January 2012 to August 2016. Mean follow-up was 40.8 +/- 13.9 months. Based on the mean mitral gradient (MMG) at baseline, 3 groups were identified: MMG <5 mm Hg (n\u202f=\u202f737, 81.7%); MMG >/=5 and <10 mm Hg (n\u202f=\u202f147, 16.3%); MMG >/=10 mm Hg (n\u202f=\u202f17, 1.9%). These latter were more frequently women, with a smaller body surface area, a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous history of coronary-artery bypass graft/percutaneous coronary intervention. At baseline, patients with MMG >/=10 mm Hg compared with >/=5 and <10 mm Hg and <5 mm Hg patients had a lower mitral valve area (2.4 +/- 0.94 vs 2.1 +/- 0.86 vs 1.5 +/- 0.44 cm(2)), a lower prevalence of MR >/=2+ (5.9% vs 28.6% and 15.6%, p <0.0001), a higher prevalence of severe mitral annular calcium (70.6% vs 45.6% and 13.0%, p <0.0001) and a higher systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (50.6 +/- 12.1 vs 47.2 +/- 14.5 and 41.6 +/- 14.4, p <0.0001). Despite the low prevalence of MMG >/=10 mm Hg, these patients had higher 5-year mortality compared with the other groups (adjusted hazard ratio 2.91, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 7.20, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). In conclusion, severe calcific MS is uncommon in patients who underwent TAVI. Its presence is associated with higher long-term mortality whereas moderate MS is not.",

A comparison study was performed under conditions mimicking gastric and gastrointestinal digestion. A preparation of encapsulated ferrous sulphate or lactate and vitamin C, in a formula, showed bioaccessibility factors of up to 100% when digested individually, and around 60% in the presence of a food matrix. The degree of oxidation of the ferrous ions differed, depending on the type of preparation, the presence of vitamin C and the food matrix. The highest percentage content of ferrous ion, in the soluble fractions after gastrointestinal digestion, was shown by the preparation containing microencapsulated ferrous lactate or ferrous sulphate and vitamin C. Encapsulation seems to limit the interaction of iron with the food matrix and protect it against oxidation, thus making it more accessible for intestinal uptake.",

Following two OPV infections reported in veterinarians scratched by sick cats in 2005 and 2007 in North-Eastern-Italy, involving a previously undescribed OPV, a similar strain was isolated by a sick cat from the same territory in 2011, i.e., 6 years later, raising attention on OPV circulation in this region. A surveillance program was launched to assess the OPV seroprevalence among the veterinarians working in local veterinary clinics and in the local wild and domestic cat population; seroprevalence was 33.3% in veterinarians and 19.5% in cats. Seroprevalence in cats was unevenly distributed, peaking at 40% in the area where OPV-infected cats had been observed.",

In this study, growth of Listeria monocytogenes in diced onions and celery and Salmonella Typhimurium in diced tomatoes was determined in modified atmosphere packages and snap-fit containers using three fluctuating temperature scenarios for transport, retail storage, and display. As expected, L. monocytogenes growth in diced onions and celery varied depending on the extent of temperature abuse, with exposure to high and intermediate temperature-abuse scenarios generally being growth supportive. A Baranyi primary model with a square-root secondary model for maximum growth rate, and a linear model for maximum population density, were used to estimate Listeria growth under fluctuating temperature. Accuracy and acceptability of the model prediction were evaluated in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and acceptable prediction zone (APZ), respectively. Overall, growth predictions for L. monocytogenes were more accurate for celery (RMSE, 0.28 to 0.47) than onions (RMSE, 0.42 to 1.53) under the fluctuating temperature scenarios tested. However, both predictions yielded APZ values that ranged from 82 to 100% for celery and 36 to 78% for onions. In contrast, Salmonella Typhimurium populations increased more than 1 log CFU/g in diced tomatoes under the three fluctuating temperature scenarios studied. Overall, these diced products packaged under a high-oxygen atmosphere showed decreased pathogen growth compared with product stored in a passive modified atmosphere. Findings from this study will be particularly useful in assessing the risk associated with consumption of diced celery, tomatoes, and onions and in designing effective packaging strategies to minimize pathogen growth in fresh-cut produce.",

There has been a lively scholarly debate over this question, but until now (future) patients have not played a large role in it. Our study supplements biomedical research into innovative diagnostics with an exlporation of its meanings and values according to (future) patients. Based on seven focusgroups with (future) patients and their care-givers, we conclude that stakeholders evaluate early diagnostics with respect to whether and how they expect it to empower their capacity to (self-) care. They value it, for instance, with respect to whether it (a) explains experienced complaints, (b) allows to start a process of psychological acceptance and social adaptation to the expected degeneration, (c) contributes to dealing with anxieties (with respect to inheritable versions of dementia), (d) informs adequately about when to start preparing for the end of life, (d) informs the planning of a request for euthanasia, or (e) allows society to deal with a growing amount of dementia patients. Our study suggests that information about disease is considered 'harmful' or 'premature' when recipients feel unable to act on that information in their (self-) care. The results of this research offers input to further ethical research. It invites to adopt a care perspective in evaluation and to seek ways to prevent the 'harm' that such diagnostic methods can bring about.",

        "abstract": "In type 1 diabetes, pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by chronic autoimmune responses. The disease develops in genetically susceptible individuals, but a role for environmental factors has been postulated. Viral infections have long been considered as candidates for environmental triggers but, given the lack of evidence for an acute, widespread, cytopathic effect in the pancreas in type 1 diabetes or for a closely related temporal association of diabetes onset with such infections, a role for viruses in type 1 diabetes remains unproven. Moreover, viruses have rarely been isolated from the pancreas of individuals with type 1 diabetes, mainly (but not solely) due to the inaccessibility of the organ. Here, we review past and recent literature to evaluate the proposals that chronic, recurrent and, possibly, persistent enteroviral infections occur in pancreatic beta cells in type 1 diabetes. We also explore whether these infections may be sustained by different virus strains over time and whether multiple viral hits can occur during the natural history of type 1 diabetes. We emphasise that only a minority of beta cells appear to be infected at any given time and that enteroviruses may become replication defective, which could explain why they have been isolated from the pancreas only rarely. We argue that enteroviral infection of beta cells largely depends on the host innate and adaptive immune responses, including innate responses mounted by beta cells. Thus, we propose that viruses could play a role in type 1 diabetes on multiple levels, including in the triggering and chronic stimulation of autoimmunity and in the generation of inflammation and the promotion of beta cell dysfunction and stress, each of which might then contribute to autoimmunity, as part of a vicious circle. We conclude that studies into the effects of vaccinations and/or antiviral drugs (some of which are currently on-going) is the only means by which the role of viruses in type 1 diabetes can be finally proven or disproven.",

The articles reviewed included original studies, recent review articles and current guidelines on the management of pneumonia in HIV-infected children. The microbiological etiology and the empiric and pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and children are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: There are many changing epidemiological factors impacting antimicrobial management of community-acquired pneumonia in the context of HIV infection in infants and children. These include vaccination strategies, antimicrobial prophylaxis, emerging drug-resistant pathogens, and recognition of the importance of viruses and tuberculosis in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. Further research is needed on optimal amtimicrobial management strategies in HIV-exposed uninfected children, and HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Cancer registries in the US collect timely and systematic data on new cancer cases, extent of disease, staging, biomarker status, treatment, survival, and mortality of cancer cases. Existing methodologies for accessing local cancer registry data for research are time-consuming and often rely on the manual merging of data by staff registrars. In addition, existing registries do not provide direct access to these data nor do they routinely provide linkage to discrete electronic health record (EHR) data, reports, or imaging data. Automation of such linkage can provide an impressive data resource and make valuable data available for translational cancer research. METHODS: The UPMC Network Cancer Registry collects highly structured, longitudinal data on all reportable cancer patients, from the point of the diagnosis throughout treatment and follow-up/outcomes. Using commercial registry software, we collect data in compliance with standards governed by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. This standardization ensures that the data are highly structured with standard coding and collection methods, which support data exchange among central cancer registries and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: At the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and University of Pittsburgh, we explored the feasibility of linking this well-curated, structured cancer registry data with unstructured text (i.e., pathology and radiology reports), using the Text Information Extraction System (TIES). We used the TIES platform to integrate breast cancer cases from the UPMC Network Cancer Registry system and then combine these data with other EHR data as a pilot use case that can be replicated for other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of this integration, we now have a single searchable repository of information for breast cancer patients from the UPMC registry, combined with their pathology and radiology reports. The system that we developed is easily scalable to other health systems and cancer centers.",

Using single mRNA imaging in living human cells, we find that the interactions of mRNAs with SGs and PBs have different dynamics, very few mRNAs directly move between SGs and PBs, and that specific RNA-binding proteins can anchor mRNAs within these compartments. During recovery from stress, we show that mRNAs that were within SGs and PBs are translated and degraded at similar rates as their cytosolic counterparts.

Although previous research indicated that there may be distinct trajectories of substance use among these youth, studies have examined them as if they were a single homogeneous group. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to explore substance use trajectories among child welfare-involved youth and to identify characteristics that distinguish substance use trajectories. METHODS: Data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) were used. Multilevel latent growth mixture modeling (MLGMM) was performed using a subsample of 625 youth from ages 11-17 years investigated for maltreatment in 2008-2009. Measures included self-reported use of substance use during the previous 30 days, demographic characteristics, maltreatment history, placement in out-of-home care, and behavioral health problems. RESULTS: MLGMM identified two distinct substance use trajectory classes including High Stable Substance Use and Rapid Progression Use. Findings suggest that the experience of physical abuse is the key factor that distinguishes the two groups. When the effects of class-specific covariates were examined, results suggest that involvement in substance use behavior and its escalation vary between groups and are affected by youth's different previous experiences. Conclusions/Importance: The results have important implications for understanding individual differences in substance use behavior over time and how these differences were shaped by youth's experiences of family adversity. Study findings may be helpful for developing and enhancing the effectiveness of interventions targeted at decreasing substance use behaviors in child welfare-involved youth.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An expanding area of research within the realm of body image is its role in human sexual functioning, which denotes people's overall satisfaction with their performance during a specific sexual encounter. Traditionally, studies investigating the association between body image and sexual functioning have focused on women. The Male Body Image Self-Consciousness Scale (M-BISC) was developed to exclusively assess male body image self-consciousness during sexual activity using a sample consisting primarily of heterosexual men. AIM: The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of the M-BISC with a sample of gay men. Research suggests that sexual difficulties and body image concerns can overlap and interrelate. Therefore, 2 subscales (erectile difficulties and body embarrassment) from the Gay Male Sexual Difficulties Scale (GMSDS) were used to assess the validity of the scale. METHODS: 1,930 men self-identifying as \"exclusively gay\" completed an online survey consisting of demographics, the M-BISC, and the GMSDS (erectile difficulties and body embarrassment subscales). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The replicability of the M-BISC factor structure with a gay male sample was determined using an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Additionally, the GMSDS (erectile difficulties and body embarrassment subscales) was used to determine the validity of the M-BISC. RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that, following the removal of 3 items, the M-BISC was unidimensional. Scale score reliability for the 14-item M-BISC was good. Finally, as predicted, scores on the M-BISC correlated with scores on the GMSDS (ie, greater sexual difficulties). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results indicate that assessment scales developed using samples consisting primarily of heterosexual men may not be appropriate for use with gay men in their original form. Thus, limiting the accuracy of the measurement and increasing the risk of misdiagnoses. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study include a large sample of exclusively gay men and the utilization of best-practice statistical analysis for assessing factor structure, validity, and reliability of measures. Limitations include the assumption that the M-BISC should be used in lieu of a novel scale developed exclusively for gay men. Further, the study utilizes an Internet sample consisting primarily of Caucasian gay men. CONCLUSION: Results of the current study illustrate that the M-BISC is a valid tool to measure gay men's body concerns during intimacy. More importantly, it also highlights gay men's elevated body concerns during intimacy and the need to understand the etiology of these apprehensions. Currently, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding the cause of gay male body concerns that have potential clinic implications. Kiss MJ, Morrison TG, McDonagh LK.

Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to protect neurons by binding to N-cadherin. Our previous results have shown that electroacupuncture could increase the expression of N-cadherin mRNA in facial neurons and promote facial nerve regeneration. In this study, the potential mechanisms by which electroacupuncture promotes nerve regeneration were elucidated through assessing the effects of electroacupuncture on GDNF and N-cadherin expression in facial motoneurons of rabbits with peripheral facial nerve crush injury. New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into a normal group (normal control, n = 21), injury group (n = 45) and electroacupuncture group (n = 45). Model rabbits underwent facial nerve crush injury only. Rabbits in the electroacupuncture group received facial nerve injury, and then underwent electroacupuncture at Yifeng (TE17), Jiache (ST6), Sibai (ST2), Dicang (ST4), Yangbai (GB14), Quanliao (SI18), and Hegu (LI4; only acupuncture, no electrical stimulation). The results showed that in behavioral assessments, the total scores of blink reflex, vibrissae movement, and position of apex nasi, were markedly lower in the EA group than those in the injury group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the right buccinator muscle of each group showed that the cross-sectional area of buccinator was larger in the electroacupuncture group than in the injury group on days 1, 14 and 21 post-surgery. Toluidine blue staining of the right facial nerve tissue of each group revealed that on day 14 post-surgery, there was less axonal demyelination and fewer inflammatory cells in the electroacupuncture group compared with the injury group. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction showed that compared with the injury group, N-cadherin mRNA levels on days 4, 7, 14 and 21 and GDNF mRNA levels on days 4, 7 and 14 were significantly higher in the electroacupuncture group. Western blot assay displayed that compared with the injury group, the expression of GDNF protein levels on days 7, 14 and 21 were significantly upregulated in the electroacupuncture group. The histology with hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining of brainstem tissues containing facial neurons in the middle and lower part of the pons exhibited that on day 7 post-surgery, there were significantly fewer apoptotic neurons in the electroacupuncture group than in the injury group. By day 21, there was no significantly difference in the number of neurons between the electroacupuncture and normal groups. Taken together, these results have confirmed that electroacupuncture promotes regeneration of peripheral facial nerve injury in rabbits, inhibits neuronal apoptosis, and reduces peripheral inflammatory response, resulting in the recovery of facial muscle function. This is achieved by up-regulating the expression of GDNF and N-cadherin in central facial neurons.",

        "abstract": "European sturgeon Acipenser sturio is an anadromous fish species being classified \"critically endangered\" with only one remaining population in the Gironde-Garonne-Dordogne basin (France). In the global warming context, this paper aims to determine the sensitivity of A. sturio early life phases to temperature and oxygen saturation. Embryos were experimentally exposed to a combination of temperature (12 to 30  degrees C) and oxygen (30 to 90% O(2) saturation) conditions. Lethal and sublethal effects were evaluated using embryonic mortality, hatching success, malformation rate, yolk sac resorption, tissue development and swimming speed. Embryonic survival peaked at 20  degrees C and no survival was recorded at 30  degrees C regardless of the associated oxygen saturation. No hatching occurred at 50% O(2) sat or below regardless of temperature. Malformation frequency appeared to be minimum at 20  degrees C and 90% O(2) sat. Swimming speed peaked at 16  degrees C. The temperature optimum of early life phases of A. sturio was determined to be close to 20  degrees C. Its upper tolerance limit is between 26 and 30  degrees C and its lower tolerance limit is below 12  degrees C. Oxygen depletion induces sublethal effects at 70% O(2) sat and lethal effects at 50% O(2) sat. Within the spawning period in the Gironde-Garonne-Dordogne basin, we identified yearly favourable oxythermal windows. Consequences of climate change would depend of the phenological adaptation of the species for its spawning period.",

Data on long term effects of prematurity on bone health are conflicting. This study aimed to compare bone mineral density (BMD) in young adults born very preterm and full-term controls and to examine factors associated with long-term bone health. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study enrolled 101 young adults (18-29\u202fyears) born <29\u202fweeks of gestation and 95 sex- and age-matched full-term controls. Participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure areal BMD and body composition. Generalized estimated equations were used to compare groups adjusting for height Z-score, lean body mass and fat mass. RESULTS: Adults born preterm were shorter and lighter than full-term controls. Areal BMD was reduced at the lumbar spine, the femoral neck and whole body in the preterm versus full-term group, but after adjustment, areal BMD Z-score was only significantly lower at the femoral neck by -0.3 unit (95% confidence interval -0.6 to -0.0). Low BMD (Z-score\u202f</=\u202f-1 standard deviation) at any site was observed in 53% of adults born preterm versus 28% of full-term controls, but this was not statistically significantly different. We did not identify any neonatal factors associated with lower BMD within the preterm group. CONCLUSIONS: Very preterm birth is associated with lower areal BMD at the femoral neck in young adulthood, even after accounting for body size. Whether this will translate into higher risk of osteoporotic fractures later in life remains unknown.",

        "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) represents joint inflammation with an unknown cause that starts before the age of 16, resulting in stiff and painful joints. In addition, JIA patients often report symptoms of sickness behavior. Recent animal studies suggest that proinflammatory cytokines produce sickness behavior by increasing the activity of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and guanosinetriphosphate(-)cyclohydrolase-1 (GTP(-)CH1). Here, it is hypothesized that inflammation in JIA patients enhances the enzymatic activity of IDO and GTP-CH1 and decreases the co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). These compounds play a crucial role in the synthesis and metabolism of neurotransmitters. The aim of our study was to reveal whether inflammation affects both the GTP-CH1 and IDO pathway in JIA patients. Serum samples were collected from twenty-four JIA patients. In these samples, the concentrations of tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), tyrosine (TYR), neopterin, and phenylalanine (PHE) were measured. An HPLC method with electrochemical detection was developed to quantify tryptophan, kynurenine, and tyrosine. Neopterin and phenylalanine were quantified by ELISA. The KYN/TRP ratio was measured as an index of IDO activity, while the PHE/TYR ratio was measured as an index of BH4 activity. Neopterin concentrations were used as an indirect measure of GTP-CH1 activity. JIA patients with high disease activity showed higher levels of both neopterin and kynurenine, and a higher ratio of both KYN/TRP and PHE/TYR and lower tryptophan levels than clinically inactive patients. Altogether, these data support our hypothesis that inflammation increases the enzymatic activity of both IDO and GTP-CH1 but decreases the efficacy of the co-factor BH4. In the future, animal studies are needed to investigate whether inflammation-induced changes in these enzymatic pathways and co-factor BH4 lower the levels of the brain neurotransmitters glutamate, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, and melatonin, and consequently, whether they may affect fatigue, cognition, anxiety, and depression. Understanding of these complex neuroimmune interactions provides new possibilities for Pharma-Food interventions to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic inflammation.",

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) comprise a range of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, with the most significant irreversible effect resulting from neurodevelopmental deficits in fetal brain caused by deficient iodine status during early pregnancy. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the studies that assessed iodine status of women of reproductive age in the USA. A systematic review of literature using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement was conducted. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCOHost, Cochrane, ERIC, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were searched, 1652 records were identified. One thousand six hundred forty-one records that did not satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality review were excluded, and 11 peer-reviewed articles were determined to be eligible for this scoping review. Despite the USA being considered iodine sufficient for the general population, the US dietary iodine intakes have decreased drastically since the 1970s, with iodine deficiency reemerging in vulnerable groups such as women of reproductive age. Although data to conduct a scoping review of iodine status among women of reproductive age in the USA was scarce, majority of the articles reviewed demonstrate emergent iodine deficiency in this population of women of reproductive age, indicating alarm for a public health concern needing immediate attention.",

        "abstract": "Lycopene is an aliphatic hydrocarbon carotenoid extracted from plants like tomatoes, papayas, and watermelons. Previous studies have shown that lycopene can exert prophylactic and/or therapeutic effects in different disorders, such as heart failure and neoplasm via anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-proliferative activities. In the central nervous system (CNS), lycopene also has prophylactic and/or therapeutic effects in different type of disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), cerebral ischemia, epilepsy, and depression. Lycopene also improves cognition and memory ability of rodents in different pathological conditions, such as diabetes, colchicine exposure, high-fat diet (HFD), and aging. Further, lycopene can prevent neuro-toxicities induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG), trimethyltin (TMT), methylmercury (MeHg), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), and cadmium (Cd). In some special conditions such as ethanol addiction and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia, lycopene administration displays special therapeutic effects. Mechanisms including inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, and restoration of mitochondrial function have been shown to mediate the neuroprotective effects of lycopene. Other mechanisms, such as inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, and restoration of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis, may be also involved in the neuroprotective effect of lycopene. In hope of get a clear impression about the role of lycopene in the CNS, we summarize and discuss the pharmacological effects of lycopene as well as its possible mechanisms in CNS disorder prevention and/or therapy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenous, noncoding small RNAs that play a key role in regulating biological and pathological processes. The oncogenic properties of miR-199b-5p have been demonstrated in previous studies but the effect of miR-199b-5p on osteosarcoma (OS) has not yet been clarified. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-199b-5p on OS and the relationship between this miR and the pathological parameters and prognosis of OS. METHODS: MiR-199b-5p expression in 57 pairs of OS tissues, corresponding adjacent normal tissues and OS cells was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).The relationship between miR-199b-5p and the pathological features and prognosis of OS patients was examined. We constructed small interfering (si) RNA to knock down miR-199b-5p expression in OS cell lines MG63 and U2OS. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), cell cloning assay and Transwell cell migration and invasion assay were applied for investigating the biological function of miR-199b-5p, respectively. Finally, western blot was used for exploring its underlying mechanism. RESULTS: MiR-199b-5p expression in OS was significantly higher than that of normal tissues. Compared to patients w\\sith low expression of miR-199b-5p, patients with high expression level tended to be with younger age, higher incidence of distant metastases and lower overall survival. Compared with interference sequence negative control (si-NC) group, the abilities of proliferation, invasion and metastasis of cells transfected with si-miR-199b-5p were significantly decreased. Western blot analysis indicated that expressions of key proteins related to epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, beta-catenin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), were significantly decreased after transfection with si-miR-199b-5p. Furthermore, we found that miR-199b-5p promoted the progression of OS mainly through regulating HER2. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulated miR-199b-5p is significantly related with stage, distant metastasis and poor prognosis of OS. This MiR may promote progression of OS through regulating HER2.",

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted between April and May 2017. SETTING: Forty public clinics in Malaysia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 956 adult patients with T2D and/or hypertension were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient experience on SMS was evaluated using a structured questionnaire of the short version Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care instrument, PACIC-M11. Linear regression analysis adjusting for complex survey design was used to determine the association of patient and clinic factors with PACIC-M11 scores. RESULTS: The overall PACIC-M11 mean was 2.3(SD,0.8) out of maximum of 5. The subscales' mean scores were lowest for patient activation (2.1(SD,1.1)) and highest for delivery system design/decision support (2.9(SD,0.9)). Overall PACIC-M11 score was associated with age, educational level and ethnicity. Higher overall PACIC-M11 ratings was observed with increasing difference between actual and expected consultation duration [beta = 0.01; 95% CI (0.001, 0.03)]. Better scores were also observed among patients who would recommend the clinic to friends and family [beta = 0.19; 95% CI (0.03, 0.36)], when health providers were able to explain things in ways that were easy to understand [beta = 0.34; 95% CI (0.10, 0.59)] and knew about patients' living conditions [beta = 0.31; 95% CI (0.15, 0.47)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated patients received low levels of SMS.

The studies' findings were extracted and summarized in a table of evidence, with their quality evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklist. Sixteen articles were included in the review. Articles explored prevention and management strategies including skin cleansing technique, diaper selection, and the application of topical skin care products. Inconsistent and limited evidence was found regarding the benefits of using disposable wipes in preference to water-moistened washcloths in the cleansing process and on the use of superabsorbent polymer diapers with breathable outer lining in IAD prevention. Findings were inconclusive with regard to the best topical skin care product for IAD care. However, the application of skin protectants was encouraged by the authors, as well as promoted in various clinical guidelines. The development of a structured skin care regimen supplemented by a comprehensive patient education program was advised to enhance the prevention and management of IAD.",

This study hypothesized that hospital safety-net burden affects presentation, treatment, and outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with esophageal cancer (2004 to 2013). Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival using chi(2) analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariable modeling. RESULTS: There were 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Further analysis of unadjusted variables such as performance status, completion of therapy, and continuity of care, and others should be undertaken among safety-net hospitals with the goal of creating appropriate clinical pathways for care of esophageal cancer in vulnerable populations.",

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 44 dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine, and prednisone (CMOP) and 51 dogs treated with CHOP at 12 referral institutions. PROCEDURES Medical records were reviewed to determine response to treatment, progression-free survival time, and overall survival time. For dogs treated with CMOP, adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS All 44 (100%) dogs treated with CMOP and 37 of 38 (97.4%) dogs treated with CHOP had a complete or partial response. Median progression-free survival time for dogs treated with CMOP was 165 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 143 to 187 days), and median overall survival time was 234 days (95% CI, 165 to 303 days). For dogs treated with CHOP, median progression-free survival time was 208 days (95% CI, 122 to 294 days), and median overall survival time was 348 days (95% CI, 287 to 409 days). Progression-free and overall survival times were not significantly different between groups. Overall, 9 of the 44 (20%) dogs treated with CMOP had adverse events likely or probably related to mitoxantrone, but all of these adverse events were mild. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that mitoxantrone may be a reasonable substitution in a CHOP protocol for treatment of dogs with multicentric intermediate- to large-cell lymphoma when doxorubicin is contraindicated.",

Methods Two-group, post-test only design, with parents (mothers and fathers) in comparison group (n = 186; received standard discharge information) recruited prior to intervention group (n = 195; received W2P Kit); most were Canadian-born and highly educated. Participants completed an investigator-designed, online or telephone survey at 3 months postpartum, which generated quantitative and qualitative data. The W2P Kit included evidence-based, educational resources about infant feeding, child development, and parenting skills that targeted mothers and fathers, information about community services for new parents, infant board book, and small gifts. Results At 3 months postpartum the intervention group was significantly more likely to be aware of, and to have used, the educational resources than the comparison group. The intervention group was also more likely to have made an unplanned visit to the doctor for their infant, but groups did not differ in early parenting experiences or use of community services. Parents who received the W2P Kit reported that it was helpful to learn about various aspects of child development and parenting. Conclusions for Practice Parents who received the W2P Kit reported increased awareness and use of educational resources, but participants in both groups reported similar experiences as a new parent and use of community services. An enhanced information package given at birth may be a useful health promotion strategy.",

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study (April 2014 to July 2017) was performed utilizing the clinical records of patients who received a premolar CAD/CAM composite crown treatment. The variables of time of treatment for (1) successful crowns (complication event-free) and (2) surviving crowns (clinically functional including re-luted) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Survival distributions regarding \"RPD abutment tooth\" and \"distalmost tooth\" were analyzed with the log-rank test. Multilevel survival analyses were used to identify hazard ratios and associated risk factors. RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-seven crowns were evaluated (mean follow-up time 1.3+/-0.9years) in 327 patients. A total of 87 crowns had at least one complication, with loss of crown retention being the most common (70 crowns). Estimated success and survival rates at 3 years were 71.7% and 96.4%, respectively. The risk of complications was significantly higher for an RPD abutment tooth than for a non-RPD abutment tooth. There was no significant difference between the distalmost tooth and non-distalmost tooth in the dental arch. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstrated complication rate for CAD/CAM composite crowns placed on premolars was 15.9% over a period of up to 3 years. There was a substantial risk of complications with placement of such a crown on an RPD abutment tooth.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & PURPOSE: Although rare, cutaneous lymphomas represent a separate entity in hematologic oncology. T cell origin lymphomas are most common, with Mycosis Fungoides (MF) accounting for about 50-70% of cases. Sezary Syndrome (SS), which represents the leukemic varian of MF, accounts for 3% of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphomas (CTCL). Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSEB) is included at the mainstream of treatment choices for CTCL. The scope of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of two treatment schedules of TSEB. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report our experience with TSEB in the management of MF and SS, as of 14 patients treated in our institution from 2011 to 2015. 8 patients received the 12\u202fGy (low dose) scheme while 6 patients were managed with 36\u202fGy (standard or full dose scheme) according to six dual field Stanford technique. The endpoints were overall response rate, duration of response and toxicity of treatment. RESULTS: After a median follow up of 2.5\u202fyears we noted excellent treatment outcome, with both schemes being well tolerated and resulting in comparable response rates. The overall response rate for both treatment regimens was over 87.5%. Treatment was well tolerated with mild toxicity. CONCLUSION: The role of TSEB in the management of MF and SS is well established. The low dose TSEB schedule of 12\u202fGy is an effective treatment option, since therapeutic results are more than acceptable, compliance is excellent and toxicity is minimal. Moreover, the evidence that it can be repeated safely makes it more attractive than the standard 36\u202fGy scheme, when a patient is referred to radiation treatment according to treatment guidelines.",

However, to date, there are no clear data regarding the correlation between PSA kinetics and PSMA-PET findings. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide evidence-based data in this setting. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of studies published through October 2018 in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases was performed. A meta-analysis to establish the detection rate (DR) of PSMA-PET using different cut-off values of PSA doubling time (PSAdt) and a pooled analysis to establish whether shorter PSAdt may predict positive PSMA-PET results was performed in patients with BRPCa. RESULTS: Twelve articles were included in the systematic review, and eight articles (including about 1400 patients) were selected for the meta-analysis. The pooled DR including 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of PSMA-PET in restaging prostate cancer (PCa) patients was 72% (95%CI:60%-82%), increasing to 83% (95%CI:75%-90%) when PSAdt was </=6 months and decreasing to 60% (95%CI:37%-80%) when PSAdt was >6 months, without a statistical significant difference. PSAdt </=6 months may predict the positive result of PSMA-PET (pooled odds ratio: 3.22; 95%CI:1.17-8.88). Statistical heterogeneity among the included studies was found. CONCLUSIONS: PSA kinetics, and in particular shorter PSAdt, may be predictor of PSMA-PET positivity in patients with BRPCa. Further larger studies in this setting are warranted.",

The aim of this study was to understand the learning experiences of immigrant registered nurses who graduated from an entry-level baccalaureate nursing program in the United States. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach with a Gadamerian focus was utilized. Purposive sampling identified five immigrant graduates who were individually interviewed using several open-ended questions in a non-structured format. Analysis identified an overarching theme, \"being on the outside.\" Five subthemes emerged: harsh realities, disruptions, nurturance, resilience, and propagation. Recommendations from the interviews include: recognition and appreciation of each student, the nurse educator coming to know oneself first, followed by dialoguing with each student to perpetuate deeper understanding. Rather than accommodating the ethnically diverse immigrant nursing student through targeted interventions, the nurse educator should maintain an all-inclusive learning environment.",

It has also been reported in wastewater and urban rivers in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Here we report the draft genome sequences of three KPC-2- and CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae sequence type 437 (ST437) isolates obtained from two urban rivers and from a clinical sample of a patient in Sao Paulo. METHODS: A genomic library was constructed using a Nextera XT Kit. An Illumina platform was used to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: WGS of environmental isolates Kp148/PINH-4900 and Kp196/TIET-4200 and clinical isolate Kp314/11 resulted in estimated genome sizes of 5464058, 5437723 and 5319218bp, respectively. Resistome analysis of the environmental and clinical strains revealed the presence of resistance genes to the following antimicrobials in all strains: aminoglycosides [aac(6')-Ib-cr]; beta-lactams (bla(OXA-1), bla(SHV-11), bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(KPC-2)); fluoroquinolones [aac(6')-Ib-cr, oqxA and oqxB]; fosfomycin (fosA(KP)); macrolides [mph(A)]; phenicols (catB4); sulfonamides (sul1); and trimethoprim (dfrA30). The tetracycline resistance gene tetA was identified in Kp148/PINH-4900 and Kp314/11 only; the aminoglycoside resistance gene aph(3')-Ia was found only in environmental isolates, and aadA2 only in Kp314/11; and the phenicol resistance gene catA1 was identified only in Kp148/PINH-4900. CONCLUSIONS: The draft genome sequences of these strains help us to elucidate the dissemination of resistance genes in micro-organisms inside and outside the hospital and are useful for further comparisons between clinical and environmental strains.",

The impact of NVP regulatory environment and vaping on cigarette demand is unknown. The current study aims to investigate whether or not respondents' reported cigarette demand, as measured by a hypothetical cigarette purchase task, varies with (1) smoking status, (2) vaping status or (3) NVP regulatory environment (country used as proxy). DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey data from wave 1 of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Four Country Smoking and Vaping (4CV) Survey (2016). SETTING: Australia, Canada, England and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 316 adult smokers. MEASUREMENTS: A hypothetical purchase task asked smokers to estimate how many cigarettes they would purchase for consumption in a single day across multiple cigarette prices. Responses were used to derive measures of cigarette demand. Overall sensitivity of cigarette consumption to price increases was quantified to index cigarette demand elasticity, whereas estimated consumption when cigarettes are free was used to index cigarette demand intensity. FINDINGS: A majority of the non-daily smokers had previously smoked daily (72.3%); daily vapers were more likely to be former daily smokers (89.9%) compared to non-daily vapers (70.1%) and non-vapers (69.2%) (P < 0.001). The smoking status x vaping status interaction was significant for cigarette demand intensity (F = 4.93; P = 0.007) and elasticity (F = 7.30; P = 0.001): among non-daily smokers, vapers reported greater intensity but lower elasticity (i.e. greater demand) relative to non-vapers (Ps < 0.05). Among daily smokers, daily vapers reported greater intensity relative to non-vapers (P = 0.005), but vaping status did not impact elasticity (Ps > 0.38). Intensity was higher in Australia compared with all other countries (Ps < 0.001), but elasticity did not vary by country (F = 2.15; P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: In a hypothetical purchase task, non-daily smokers showed lower price elasticity if they used e-cigarettes than if they did not, while there was no clear difference in elasticity between e-cigarette users and non-users among daily smokers or according to regulatory environment of their country with regard to e-cigarettes.",

Treatment consists of surgical excision, endovascular embolization, or a combination of the two. If complete obliteration of the nidus exposes the patient to undue risk of permanent neurological deficits, incomplete obliteration with reduction of the vascular supply is a reasonable compromise to improve clinical symptomatology. Partial devascularization may also alter the natural history by decreasing the risk of further growth and bleeding. In this video we illustrate the case of a patient with a perimedullary fistula of the conus treated with surgical disconnection of the main fistulous component. Partial devascularization resulted in resolution of MRI signal changes and symptoms with documented good clinical and radiological outcome and progressive regression of the residual nidus over six years of follow-up.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apatinib is a newly approved antitumor drug (molecular targeted agent/small molecular kinase inhibitor) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. However, current oral administration of apatinib could induce the even distribution of drugs in the body and cause the concentration of apatinib in the HCC location to be limited or insufficient. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel formulations of apatinib to improve its efficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apatinib was prepared to form a stable and even dispersion with cyclodextrin (a clathrate complex/inclusion complex named Apa-Cyc). A temperature-sensitive phase-change hydrogel of apatinib (named Apa-Gel) was prepared using apatinib-cyclodextrin and poloxamer 407. Apa-Gel was injected into HCC tissues in nude mice to examine the long-term antitumor effect. RESULTS: Apa-Gel can transform from liquid to hydrogel at near body temperature and maintain slow release of apatinib in HCC tumor tissues. When injected subcutaneously, one-time administration of Apa-Gel has a long-acting antitumor effect on the subcutaneous growth or epithelial-mesenchymal transition process of HCC cells. CONCLUSION: This novel slow-releasing system allows apatinib to be released effectively on the long term and facilitates tissue attachment, thereby preserving the efficiency of apatinib over the long term.",

The reactive oxygen levels (ROS) (evaluated by fluorimetry) were increased relative to the control in K562 and K562-Lucena cells treated with 100 microg/mL and were not increased in FEPS cells. The expression of the following genes related to resistance was evaluated by real-time PCR: COX2, ALOX5, ABCB1 and ABCC1. Treatment with 100 microg/mL of C-PC increased COX2 and ABCB1 expression in K562-Lucena cells and reduced expression of ALOX5 in K562-Lucena and FEPS cells. ROS levels appear to be involved in biological responses to C-PC in K562 and K562-Lucena cells, although expression of the genes studied here was only modified by C-PC in the K562-Lucena cell line. Thus, it is possible to suggest that C-PC modulates the expression of COX2 and ABCB1 for the K562-Lucena in a ROS-dependent manner and the expression of ALOX5 for the FEPS in a ROS-independent manner; however, more studies are needed to elucidate these mechanisms.",

Patients presenting with chronic depression were randomly allocated to a treatment group or a waiting list group, which received body psychotherapy after a period on a waiting list. Correlations between repertory grid, questionnaire, and visual analogue measures indicated that depression and bodily dissatisfaction were associated with features of the content and structure of construing.

        "abstract": "Liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer\u2011related mortality worldwide and its incidence is increasing. Considerable effort has been made in recent decades to improve the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Advanced liver cancer often exhibits a poor response to chemotherapy and poor prognosis due to acquired chemoresistance and tumor recurrence. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that are responsible for chemotherapeutic drug\u2011induced cell death could potentially identify novel therapeutic targets and improve liver cancer treatment. In the present study, it was demonstrated that in response to doxorubicin, the most frequently used chemical compound for liver cancer treatment, histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) is specifically downregulated. This enables forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) upregulation, translocation into the nucleus and increased expression of its target genes p27 and Bim, which further induce apoptosis. Overexpression of SIRT6, but not enzyme\u2011inactivated mutants, prevents FOXO3 translocation into the nucleus and doxorubicin\u2011induced cell death. SIRT6 interacts with FOXO3 and this interaction increases FOXO3 ubiquitination and decreases its stability. Finally, it was identified that the effect of SIRT6 in preventing doxorubicin\u2011induced cell death requires FOXO3. Overexpression of SIRT6 could not prevent doxorubicin\u2011induced cell death in FOXO3\u2011knockdown cells. Therefore, it was concluded that SIRT6 plays a central role in determining doxorubicin\u2011induced cell death via modulation of FOXO3 activity. Therapeutic targeting of SIRT6 and/or FOXO3 may offer novel strategies for treatment of liver cancer.",

The binding of G2BR to Ube2g2 allosterically enhances the binding of RING to E2, and the binding of RING triggers the departure of G2BR from E2 also in an allosteric fashion. Targeting these allosteric events, we developed a family of inhibitors that irreversibly block E2-E3 interactions and thereby eliminate the tumorigenic effect of gp78. One among 19 compounds screened with the NCI 60 tumor cell lines exhibited outstanding anticancer activities.

METHODS: This study was performed by analyzing the reported mortality data in 29 provinces of Iran in 2006-2010. Mortality trend of gastrointestinal cancers was drawn for both sexes in the study years and disaggregated by age groups and their frequency distribution. The WinPepi software was used for analysis. RESULTS: In the years 2006-2010, the mortality rate of, gastric, colorectal, liver and pancreatic cancers, has significantly increased. Totally, gastrointestinal mortality is higher in men than women. Also, the results showed that by increasing age, death from these cancers also increased. CONCLUSION: The most important causes of death from gastrointestinal cancers were gastric, liver and colorectal cancers in Iran and because of their increasing trend in the country, performing preventive interventions for the cancers' risk factors is necessary.",

The continual access of these grafts allows for potential failure over extended periods of hemodialysis treatment, as a result of thrombosis and pseudoaneurysm formation. Patency of AV grafts requires interventional management of thrombosis and pseudoaneurysm formation, including thrombectomy and covered stent placement, respectively. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Gore REVISE study, giving indication for covered stents within AV grafts. If covered stent placement is required to treat a thrombosed AV graft, it is still possible to perform a percutaneous thrombectomy procedure afterwards. Direct access of the AV graft by passing through both the graft material and covered stents allows for interventional radiology management to be performed without compromise of the stent or graft. This interventional method of direct access can salvage the AV graft before considering further invasive management, such as a new surgical venous access site.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization recommends viral load (VL) monitoring at six and twelve months and then annually after initiating antiretroviral treatment for HIV. In many African countries, expansion of VL testing has been slow due to a lack of efficient blood sample transportation networks (STN). To assist Zambia in scaling up testing capacity, we modelled an optimal STN to minimize the cost of a national VL STN. METHODS: The model optimizes a STN in Zambia for the anticipated 1.5 million VL tests that will be needed in 2020, taking into account geography, district political boundaries, and road, laboratory and facility infrastructure. We evaluated all-inclusive STN costs of two alternative scenarios: (1) optimized status quo: each district provides its own weekly or daily sample transport; and (2) optimized borderless STN: ignores district boundaries, provides weekly or daily sample transport, and reaches all Scenario 1 facilities. RESULTS: Under both scenarios, VL testing coverage would increase to from 10% in 2016 to 91% in 2020. The mean transport cost per VL in Scenario 2 was $2.11 per test (SD $0.28), 52% less than the mean cost/test in Scenario 1, $4.37 (SD $0.69), comprising 10% and 19% of the cost of a VL respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An efficient STN that optimizes sample transport on the basis of geography and test volume, rather than political boundaries, can cut the cost of sample transport by more than half, providing a cost savings opportunity for countries that face significant resource constraints.",

In this longitudinal study, raw wastewater was collected monthly from three U.S. cities as 24-h weekday composites and analyzed for evidence of alcohol and tobacco consumption. Over the 11-month sampling period, biomarkers of stimulant use were detected in wastewater by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in units of mug/L (ethyl sulfate, 1.6-25.1; nicotine, 0.6-26.7; cotinine, 0.2-3.8; and 3\u2011hydroxycotinine, 0.3-3.8). Average consumption rates in the three communities were calculated using detected biomarker levels in conjunction with wastewater flow rates, metabolic excretion factors, and population size data. Computed average per-capita consumption rates estimated for the sub-population aged 15 and above for alcohol (13.4\u202f+/-\u202f5.6\u202fL/y/person) and daily consumption of nicotine by smokers (14.2\u202f+/-\u202f3.6 cigarettes/d/person) were in good agreement with U.S. survey data (9.0\u202fL/y/person; 14.2 cigarettes/d/smoker). The WBE approach also captured impacts of temporal population influx on substance consumption patterns.

METHODS: All board-certified orthopedic surgeons' offices in Miami-Dade County were identified by their American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons active membership. Offices were contacted and presented a hypothetical patient with end-stage OA searching for treatment (SCT or PRP injections) before having to undergo surgery. RESULTS: Of the 96 registered American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons member's offices, 91 (94.7%) were contacted, 36% of offices offered PRP, and 24.5% offered SCT. However, 81% of the offices were transparent on the pricing of PRP, whereas 42% gave a price for SCT. Remaining practices stated that pricing would be \"determined or discussed\" during a scheduled visit. Mean cost for PRP injection was $897 (range, $350 to $1,700), and for SCT injection, it was $3,100 (range, $1,200 to $6,000).

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) neurofeedback (NF) training-targeting the dlPFC-and its effects on threat-related attention biases of individuals with SAD. 12 individuals with SAD participated in the NIRS-NF training lasting 6-8 weeks and including a total of 15 sessions. NF performance increased significantly, while the attention bias towards threat-related stimuli and SAD symptom severity decreased after the training. The individual increase in neurofeedback performance as well as the individual decrease in SAD symptom severity was correlated with decreased responses to social threat signals in the cerebral attention system. Thus, this pilot study does not only demonstrate that NIRS-based NF is feasible in SAD patients, but also may be a promising method to investigate the causal role of the dlPFC in attention biases in SAD. Its effectiveness as a treatment tool might be examined in future studies.",

The markers include core forensic short tandem repeats (STRs) as well as identity, ancestry and phenotype informative short nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this work, the MiSeq FGx Forensic Genomics System was evaluated by analysing reproducibility, sensitivity, mixture identification and forensic phenotyping capabilities of the assay. Furthermore, the genotype calling of the ForenSeq Universal Analysis Software was verified by analysing fastq.gz files from the MiSeq FGx platform using the softwares STRinNGS and GATK. Overall, the performance of the MiSeq FGx Forensic Genomics System was high. However, locus and allele drop-outs were relatively frequent at six loci (two STRs and four human identification SNPs) due to low read depth or skewed heterozygote balances, and the stutter ratios were larger than those observed with conventional STR genotyping methods. The risk of locus and allele drop-outs increased dramatically when the amount of DNA in the first PCR was lower than 250 pg. Two-person 50:1 mixtures were identified as mixtures, whereas 100:1 and 1 000:1 mixtures were not. Y-chromosomal short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) alleles were detected in the 100:1 and 1 000:1 female/male mixtures. The ForenSeq Universal Analysis Software provided the data analyst with useful alerts that simplified the analysis of the large number of markers. Many of the alerts were due to user-defined, locus-specific criteria. The results shown here indicated that the default settings should be altered for some loci. Also, recommended changes to the assay and software are discussed.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients and three computer models without scar were studied. Regional voltage amplitudes were evaluated in nine LBBB patients who underwent endocardial electro-anatomic mapping (EAM). Pacing-induced voltage differences were evaluated in 12 patients who underwent epicardial EAM during intrinsic rhythm and right ventricular (RV) pacing. Three computer models customized for LBBB patients were created. Changes in voltage amplitudes after an LBBB (intrinsic), a normal synchronous, an RV pacing, and a left ventricular pacing activation sequence were assessed in the computer models. Unipolar voltage amplitudes in patients were approximately 4.5 mV (4.4-4.7 mV,  approximately 33%) lower in the septum when compared with other segments. A normal synchronous activation sequence in the computer models normalized voltage amplitudes in the septum. Pacing-induced differences were larger in electrograms with higher voltage amplitudes during intrinsic rhythm and furthermore larger and more variable at the epicardium [mean absolute difference: 3.6-6.2 mV, 40-53% of intrinsic value; interquartile range (IQR) differences: 53-63% of intrinsic value] compared to the endocardium (mean absolute difference: 3.3-3.8 mV, 28-30% of intrinsic value; IQR differences: 37-40% of intrinsic value). CONCLUSION: In patients and computer models without scar, lower septal unipolar voltage amplitudes are exclusively associated with an LBBB activation sequence. Pacing substantially affects voltage amplitudes, particularly at the epicardium.",

Here, two rice PHS mutants F254 and F5-1 were characterized. In addition to the PHS, these mutants showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as twisting and slender leaves, and then died when the seedling developed to four or five leaves. Map-based cloning showed that OsCNX6 and OsCNX1 encoding homologs of MoaE and MoeA were responsible for F254 and F5-1 mutants, respectively. Genetic complementation indicated that OsCNX6 not only rescued the PHS and seedling lethal phenotype of the cnx6 mutant, but also recovered the MoCo-dependent enzyme activities such as xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase (AO), nitrate reductase (NR) and sulfite oxidase (SO). Expression pattern showed that OsCNX6 was richly expressed in seed during embryo maturation by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and RNA in situ hybridization. Furthermore, the OsCNX6 overexpression plants can significantly enhance the MoCo-dependent enzyme activities, and improved the osmotic and salt stress tolerance without unfavorable phenotypes. Collectively, these data indicated that OsCNX6 participated in MoCo biosynthesis, and is essential for rice development, especially for seed dormancy and germination, and OsCNX6 could be an effective target for improving abiotic stress tolerance in rice.",

The analog optical link manifests its high fidelity in the measured characteristics: small gain variation (< +/- 1 dB for the entire transmission bandwidth), low noise (<-136 dBm/Hz), and large dynamic range (spurious free dynamic range of >106 dB\u2219Hz(2/3)), subsequently providing superior error vector magnitude (EVM) performance (~2%) for a wide range of ambient temperatures (-20 ~60 degrees C).

The current research seeks to contribute to that initiative by using a neurophysiological measure, transcranial Doppler sonography that has been shown to be sensitive to decrements in sustained attention and may provide an additional biomarker of executive dysfunction in ADHD. Twenty-seven participants performed a 12-min vigilance task while cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was recorded. Thirteen participants were included in an ADHD condition if they had been formally diagnosed with ADHD. The remaining 14 participants who had never been formally diagnosed with ADHD were included in the control condition. Participants that had been diagnosed with ADHD demonstrated a steeper decrement in performance accuracy, a steeper decrement in perceptual sensitivity, and employed a more liberal response bias over time as compared to the control participants. Critically, the decrement in CBFV was steeper for participants previously diagnosed with ADHD than those who were not. Moreover, CBFV was found to better predict decreases in sensitivity and hit rate, as well as increases in liberal responding above and beyond self-reported ADHD symptoms. Results suggest that CBFV can be used to index failures of executive control in ADHD and can predict response strategy, and that the measure may provide an additional index of the sustained attention deficits associated with ADHD compared to traditional diagnostic methods.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Maternal psychological distress is associated with a range of adverse child outcomes. We sought to determine whether children's exposure to medium or severe distress at 5 years was associated with increased risks of overweight and obesity when they were aged 11 years. We also investigated whether any association was attenuated after accounting for potential confounding and mediating factors. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We analysed data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a nationally representative sample with data collected throughout childhood, imputing missing covariates (analytic sample: n = 9206). Multinomial regression was used to examine whether maternal psychological distress (Kessler-6 scale, using medium and severe score thresholds) at 5 years of age predicted children's objectively measured overweight and obesity at 11 years, adjusting for sex and ethnicity. We then carried out a series of models incorporating potential confounders (early life and socio-demographic, recorded at 9 months) and mediators (physical activity and dietary factors, at 7 years) in turn, and then simultaneously. RESULTS: A third of mothers reported distress when their child was aged 5 years (29% medium; 4% severe distress), and over a quarter of children were overweight at 11 years (22% overweight; 6% obese). Risks of obesity at 11 years increased with severity of maternal distress at 5 years (medium distress: relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-1.75; severe RRR = 2.27, CI 1.42-3.63). Adjusting for each set of explanatory factors in turn (particularly early years and socio-demographic confounding factors) reduced but did not eliminate these elevated risks. However, risks were attenuated in the fully adjusted model (medium: RRR = 1.14, CI 0.92-1.41; severe: RRR = 1.26, CI 0.75-2.11). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that maternal psychological distress, particularly if severe, at 5 years was associated with risk of obesity (but not overweight) at 11 years. Accounting for potential explanatory factors attenuated this association to non-significance, suggesting a range of mechanisms may be implicated. Future research should seek to disentangle the potentially complex pathways linking explanatory factors, maternal distress and child obesity.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a significant health problem that is increasing in prevalence, and advances in treatment are needed. METHODS: We briefly review the leading evidence-based psychological therapies for chronic pain-cognitive-behavioral and acceptance/mindfulness-based therapies-and examine several limitations and missing perspectives of these approaches. We review six lesser-known interventions that address these limitations, and we describe our integrative model for psychological assessment and treatment of centralized pain. We present a typical patient and describe how we apply this approach, along with challenges to its implementation and possible solutions to these challenges. RESULTS: Greater pain treatment efficacy may be possible if clinicians: (a) distinguish patients with primarily centralized (i.e., somatoform or nociplastic) pain from those with primarily peripheral (nociceptive, inflammatory, or neuropathic) pain; (b) acknowledge the capacity of the brain not only to modulate pain but also generate as well as attenuate or eliminate centralized pain; (c) consider the powerful role that adverse life experiences and psychological conflicts play in centralized pain; and (d) integrate emotional processing and interpersonal changes into treatment. Our integrative treatment involves delivering a progression of interventions, as needed, to achieve pain reduction: tailored pain neuroscience education, cognitive and mindfulness skills to decrease the pain danger alarm mechanism, behavioral engagement in avoided painful and other feared activities, emotional awareness and expression to reverse emotional avoidance and overcome trauma or psychological conflict, and adaptive communication to decrease interpersonal stress. CONCLUSIONS: This integrative assessment and treatment model has the potential to substantially reduce and sometimes eliminate centralized pain by changing the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and interpersonal processes that trigger and maintain centralized pain.",

DESIGN CROSS-SECTIONAL SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: UK adults aged 45 years and over (N = 366, n = 177 male, n = 189 female). MEASUREMENTS: Bioimpedance analysis was used to derive SMI. CAVI score was calculated using a vascular screening system. Handgrip strength was measured using a standard dynamometer. RESULTS: Average CAVI was significantly correlated with SMI (correlation coefficient (r) = -0.285, p < .001), with higher correlation in women (r = -0.416, p < .001) than men (r = -0.214, p = .01). CAVI had the highest correlation with SMI from appendicular muscle (fat-free mass in men, r = -0.253, p = .002; predicted muscle mass in women, r = -0.436, p < .001). There was a significant difference in average CAVI between groups, with participants who were not sarcopenic having lower CAVI (8.98) than those who were sarcopenic (9.80) (p < .001, t-test). Linear regression was performed using SMI as the dependent variable. After adjustment for age, average CAVI was a significant predictor of SMI in women (beta = -0.332, p < .001) but not men. CONCLUSION: Indices of sarcopenia are independently associated with a higher CAVI, with greater correlation in women than men. The CAVI can be used to assess overall vascular compliance and may be a useful operator-independent tool that can be used to measure sarcopenia and its cardiovascular implications in older adults.

METHODS: Vestibular, postural, clinical, and polygraphic parameters were assessed in 32 OSA patients before and after beneficial CPAP treatment by means of video head impulse test (vHIT), static posturography (SP), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), respectively, and were compared by means of a \"within-subject\" ANOVA model and Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: After the 12-month period of treatment, OSA patients demonstrated a significant reduction in AHI values, in both opened and closed eyes conditions of surface and length as well as in power spectra recorded in low, middle, and high frequency interval. Although a significant improvement was also recorded among DHI and ESS scores, VOR gain increase did not survive to post-hoc corrections. Finally, positive correlations between the differences between pre- and post-treatment AHI, ESS, and PS values were found. CONCLUSIONS: The present work highlighted that postural instability and dizziness-related conditions due to OSA may improve after 12 months of CPAP treatment. Although VOR gain did not demonstrate significant improvement, this study might open future perspectives directed to assessing VOR gain changes after longer periods of CPAP treatment.",

        "abstract": "Osteoblast differentiation, defined as the process whereby a relatively unspecialized cell acquires the specialized features of an osteoblast, is directly linked to multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease. Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are proved to be implicated in the pathological or defective osteoblast differentiation process. This study aims to test the involvement of Wnt, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) pathways, and empty spiracles homeobox 2 (EMX2) in osteoblast differentiation and MM development. Initially, differentially expressed genes in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from MM patients and healthy donors were identified using microarray-based gene expression profiling. The functional role of Wnt and BMP in MM was determined. Next, we focused on the co-operative effects of Wnt and BMP on calcium deposition, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, the number of mineralized nodules, and osteocalcin (OCN) content in MSCs. The expression patterns of Wnt and BMP pathway-related genes, EMX2 and osteoblast differentiation-related factors were determined to assess their effects on osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, regulation of Wnt and BMP in ectopic osteogenesis was also investigated in vivo. An integrated genomic screen suggested that Wnt and BMP regularly co-operate to regulate EMX2 and affect MM. EMX2 was downregulated in MSCs. The activated Wnt and BMP resulted in more calcium salt deposits, mineralized nodules, and a noted increased in ALP activity and OCN content by upregulating EMX2, leading to induced differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts. Collectively, this study demonstrated that Wnt and BMP pathways could co-operatively stimulate differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts and inhibit MM progression, representing potential targets for MM treatment.",

METHODS: We collected data from the Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Epidemiology database on persons with CD (n=852) or UC (n=303), from 2001 through 2016, who began treatment with a TNF antagonist. New and/or continuing users of immunomodulators at the time anti-TNF therapy began were considered recipients of combination therapy. The main outcome was treatment ineffectiveness (IBD-related hospitalization, intestinal resection, corticosteroid use, or change of anti-TNF agent) during TNF antagonist-based therapy or within 90 days after the anti-TNF agent was discontinued. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between concomitant use of immunomodulators and treatment ineffectiveness. RESULTS: In patients with CD, combination therapy was associated with a significant decrease in likelihood of treatment ineffectiveness (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for ineffectiveness, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49-0.79). However, this association was not significant in patients with UC (aHR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.56-1.20). In patients with CD, combination therapy was also associated with increased time to first IBD-related hospitalization (aHR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.80) and switching anti-TNF agents (aHR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41-0.97), but not associated with IBD-related surgery (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.51-1.12) or new or recurrent use of corticosteroids (aHR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55-1.04). CONCLUSION: In an analysis of a database of real-world patients with IBD, we associated initiation therapy with a combination immune modulators and anti-TNF agents with a decreased likelihood of treatment ineffectiveness for patients with CD but not UC.",

Methods: A meta-synthesis. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed qualitative single studies of fathers' experiences during the first week after early discharge (defined as less than 72 hours postpartum) from hospital after the birth of a healthy singleton baby born between weeks 37 and 40. Databases: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline, Maternity and Infant Care, Joanna Briggs, SweMed+ and PsycInfo were searched in May 2015 and May 2018. Of the 940 titles scanned for eligibility, three articles met the inclusion criteria. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist was used. Findings: All included studies were conducted in Sweden during the period 2002-2012. The total sample of participants in the meta-synthesis comprised 35 fathers. Analysis of the included studies generated two themes: building confidence and coping with responsibility. Conclusions: The fathers' experiences were affected by the emotional support of midwives, which boosted their confidence. This seems to be a premise for taking and coping with responsibility during the first days at home. Good cooperation between hospitals and municipalities is vital, and midwives must be available and present in order to ensure continuity in maternity care.",

        "abstract": "Bovine mycotic abortion is sporadic and caused by different ubiquitous and opportunistic fungi. Recently, a broad spectrum of bacterial opportunists involved in bovine abortion was revealed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We hypothesized that fungal organisms potentially involved in bovine abortion also might remain undetected by conventional culture. In this retrospective study, we therefore applied fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region amplicon sequencing to 74 cases of bovine abortion submitted to our diagnostic service. The investigation was complemented by fungal culture and, retrospectively, by data from bacteriological, virological and parasitological analyses and histopathological examination of placentas. Fungal DNA was found in both the placentas and abomasal contents, with 92 fungal genera identified. In 18 cases, >75% of the reads belonged to one specific fungal genus: Candida (n = 7), Malassezia (n = 4), Cryptococcus (n = 3), unidentified Capnodiales (n = 3), Actinomucor (n = 1), Cystofilobasidium (n = 1), Penicillium (n = 1), Verticillum (n = 1) and Zymoseptoria (n = 1) with one case harboring two different genera. By culture, in contrast, fungal agents were detected in only 6 cases. Inflammatory and/or necrotizing lesions were found in 27/40 histologically assessed placentas. However, no lesion-associated fungal structures were detected in HE- and PAS-stained specimens. Complementary data revealed the presence of one or more non-fungal possible abortifacient: Chlamydiales, Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira spp., Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pluranimalium, Bacillus licheniformis, Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, Serratia marcescens, Trueperella pyogenes, Schmallenbergvirus, Neospora caninum. The mycobiota revealed by sequencing did not differ between cases with or without a possible infectious etiology. Our study suggests that amplicon sequencing of the ITS2 region from DNA isolated from bovine abortion does not provide additional information or new insight into mycotic abortion and without complementary analyses may easily lead to a false interpretation of the role of fungal organisms in bovine abortion.",

In this work, for in vivo detecting indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), one of phytohormones, fine stainless steel (SS) wire was used as electrode material. Highly ordered nanopores, popcorn-like Au nanostructures, Pt nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) nanocomposite films, and polymerized ST film (PST) were fabricated on the SS microelectrode in turn for improving the detection effect. Using the as-prepared SS microelectrode as working electrode, two untreated SS wires as reference electrode and counter electrode respectively, a disposable electrochemical microsensor for IAA were developed. The microsensor exhibited excellent selectivity and high sensitivity with low detection limit (LOD) of 43\u202fpg\u202fmL(-1). The limit of quantity (LOQ) is 143\u202fpg\u202fmL(-1). The RSD was 7% for 12 different PST/Pt-ERGO/Au/a-SS microsensors in presence of 100\u202fmicrog\u202fmL(-1) IAA. Using this microsensor, IAA of the stem of soybean seedlings was detected in vivo under salt stress. Our result was also confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrum (UPLC-MS). This is the first report for the in vivo detection of IAA in plants using SS-based electrochemical microsensor. Our sensor provides an excellent sensing platform for detecting IAA in plants in vivo.",

A focal point of NOD2 signaling is RIP2, which upon polyubiquitination nucleates the NOD2:RIP2 complex, enabling signaling events leading to inflammation, yet the precise nature and the regulation of the polyubiquitins coordinating this process remain unclear. Here we show that NOD2 signaling involves conjugation of RIP2 with lysine 63 (K63), K48 and M1 polyubiquitin chains, as well as with non-canonical K27 chains. In addition, we identify MYSM1 as a proximal deubiquitinase that attenuates NOD2:RIP2 complex assembly by selectively removing the K63, K27 and M1 chains, but sparing the K48 chains. Consequently, MYSM1 deficient mice have unrestrained NOD2-mediated peritonitis, systemic inflammation and liver injury. This study provides a complete overview of the polyubiquitins in NOD2:RIP2 signaling and reveal MYSM1 as a central negative regulator restricting these polyubiquitins to prevent excessive inflammation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the analysis of a large number of metagenomic sequences costs heavy computing resources and takes long time, we examined a selected small part of metagenomic sequences as \"sample\"s of the entire full sequences, both for a mock community and for 10 different existing metagenomics case studies. A mock community with 10 bacterial strains was prepared, and their mixed genome were sequenced by Hiseq. The hits of BLAST search for reference genome of each strain were counted. Each of 176 different small parts selected from these sequences were also searched by BLAST and their hits were also counted, in order to compare them to the original search results from the full sequences. We also prepared small parts of sequences which were selected from 10 publicly downloadable research data of MG-RAST service, and analyzed these samples with MG-RAST. RESULTS: Both the BLAST search tests of the mock community and the results from the publicly downloadable researches of MG-RAST show that sampling an extremely small part from sequence data is useful to estimate brief taxonomic information of the original metagenomic sequences. For 9 cases out of 10, the most annotated classes from the MG-RAST analyses of the selected partial sample sequences are the same as the ones from the originals. CONCLUSIONS: When a researcher wants to estimate brief information of a metagenome's taxonomic distribution with less computing resources and within shorter time, the researcher can analyze a selected small part of metagenomic sequences. With this approach, we can also build a strategy to monitor metagenome samples of wider geographic area, more frequently.",

Recently, NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome functions in impairing endothelial barrier function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that TXNIP-NLRP3 axis repression prevents against intestinal barrier function disruption in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). First, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced alterations in expression of ZO-1 and occludin, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and TXNIP(-/-) mice were evaluated. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of TXNIP knockout in vivo were investigated with the detection of expressions of TXNIP, NLRP3 and ZO-1, and occludin, the interaction of TXNIP-NLRP3, MPO activity, ROS level, permeability of intestinal mucosa, levels of inflammatory factors in serum, and LPS concentration. We identified that TXNIP knockout promoted ZO-1 and occludin expression, yet reduced MPO activity, ROS level, and cell permeability in IECs, indicating restored the intestinal barrier function. However, LPS upregulated TXNIP and NLRP3 expression, as well as contributed to the interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3 in vitro. Furthermore, TXNIP was significantly upregulated in the intestinal mucosa of NASH mice and its knockout repaired the intestinal barrier disrupt, inhibited expression of inflammatory factors, and reduced LPS concentration as well as hepatic injury in vivo. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that inhibited the activation of the TXNIP-NLRP3 axis reduced MPO activity and oxidative stress and thus restoring the intestinal barrier function in NASH. TXNIP-NLRP3 axis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the NASH treatment.",

In the current study, we investigated the role of anti-oxidant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity. We found that human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exhibited significant apoptotic cell death following PFOS exposure, and this process was accompanied with apparent accumulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS). In addition, we revealed that PFOS exposure caused marked activation of Nrf2 pathway and the expression of Nrf2 transcription target heme oxygenase-1. We further found that pre-treatment with ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) dramatically ameliorated PFOS-induced ROS production and Nrf2 signaling. In keeping with these findings, western blot and Cell Counter Kit-8 analyses revealed that pre-incubation with NAC suppressed PFOS-induced expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and impairment of neuronal viability. Moreover, antagonizing Nrf2 pathway with Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol resulted in increased ROS production and enhanced PFOS-induced expression of apoptosis related proteins. Finally, we showed that PFOS exposure altered mitochondrial transmembrane potential and disrupted normal mitochondrial morphology in SH-SY5Y cells. Whereas treatment with NAC ameliorated PFOS-induced mitochondrial disorders, co-incubation with brusatol augmented PFOS-induced mitochondrial deficits, consequently contributing to neuronal apoptosis. These results manifest that Nrf2 pathway plays a protective role in PFOS-induced neurotoxicity, providing new insights into the prevention and treatment of PFOS-related toxicities.",

        "abstract": "Knowing the full set of essential genes for a given organism provides important information about ways to promote, and to limit, its growth and survival. For many non-model organisms, the lack of a stable haploid state and low transformation efficiencies impede the use of conventional approaches to generate a genome-wide comprehensive set of mutant strains and the identification of the genes essential for growth. Here we report on the isolation and utilization of a highly stable haploid derivative of the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, together with a modified heterologous transposon and machine learning (ML) analysis method, to predict the degree to which all of the open reading frames are required for growth under standard laboratory conditions. We identified 1,610 C. albicans essential genes, including 1,195 with high \"essentiality confidence\" scores, thereby increasing the number of essential genes (currently 66 in the Candida Genome Database) by >20-fold and providing an unbiased approach to determine the degree of confidence in the determination of essentiality. Among the genes essential in C. albicans were 602 genes also essential in the model budding and fission yeasts analyzed by both deletion and transposon mutagenesis. We also identified essential genes conserved among the four major human pathogens C. albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum and highlight those that lack homologs in humans and that thus could serve as potential targets for the design of antifungal therapies.IMPORTANCE Comprehensive understanding of an organism requires that we understand the contributions of most, if not all, of its genes. Classical genetic approaches to this issue have involved systematic deletion of each gene in the genome, with comprehensive sets of mutants available only for very-well-studied model organisms. We took a different approach, harnessing the power of in vivo transposition coupled with deep sequencing to identify >500,000 different mutations, one per cell, in the prevalent human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and to map their positions across the genome. The transposition approach is efficient and less labor-intensive than classic approaches. Here, we describe the production and analysis (aided by machine learning) of a large collection of mutants and the comprehensive identification of 1,610 C. albicans genes that are essential for growth under standard laboratory conditions. Among these C. albicans essential genes, we identify those that are also essential in two distantly related model yeasts as well as those that are conserved in all four major human fungal pathogens and that are not conserved in the human genome. This list of genes with functions important for the survival of the pathogen provides a good starting point for the development of new antifungal drugs, which are greatly needed because of the emergence of fungal pathogens with elevated resistance and/or tolerance of the currently limited set of available antifungal drugs.",

I observed that all involve quasi-emotional reactions to stimuli that are composites of multiple elements that ordinarily do not occur together and whose interaction, when appropriately potentiated, is transformative-different in kind from the effects of the separate constituent elements. Such effects, termed synergetic, can evoke surprise-tinged emotional responses. Aesthetic reactions, unlike many other kinds of emotional reactions, are never evoked by biologically urgent action-demanding events, such as threats or opportunities. The examined effects were created by various concept manipulation devices: class expansion, identification of new relations, repetition, symmetry, parsimony, and emotional displays for the audience to mirror (I identified a total of 16 such devices). The effects would occur only for individuals with the necessary priming, in circumstances that include effective potentiating factors. Synergetic stimuli that evoke aesthetic responses tend to be reinforcing, via mechanisms related to their biological utility during our evolution. I offer a theory as to how aesthetics may have evolved from its primordial pre-aesthetic roots, with examples of how consideration of those roots often explains aesthetic and related effects. The article suggests that aesthetic phenomena are a special case of a more pervasive aspect of behavior and proposes research approaches involving laboratory models and fMRI technology.",

We studied inter- and intraindividual differences in the metacontrol bias towards persistence or flexibility in cognitive search tasks from various cognitive domains that require continuous switching between persistence and flexibility. For each task, clustering and switching scores were derived to assess persistence and flexibility, respectively, as well as a total performance score to reflect general performance. We compared two, not mutually exclusive accounts according to which the balance between clustering and switching scores is affected by (1) individual, trait-like metacontrol biases towards persistence or flexibility and/or (2) the metacontrol adaptivity to bias states according to changing situational demands. We found that clustering and switching scores failed to generalize across tasks. However, clustering and switching were inversely related and predicted the total performance scores in most of the tasks, which in turn partially generalized across tasks and task domains. We conclude that metacontrol-biases towards persistence or flexibility can be adapted easily to specific task demands and individual resources, possibly overwriting individual metacontrol trait biases. Moreover, we suggest that total performance scores might serve to measure metacontrol adaptivity in future studies if task-restrictions and resources are known and/or well balanced.",

This study aimed to explore the association between famine exposure in early life and risk of diabetes in adulthood. METHODS: A total of 4138 subjects were selected from the data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011-2012. Diabetes was diagnosed as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >/=7.0 mmol/L, glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)) > 6.5%, or self-reported diabetes. Birthdates of subjects were used to categorize famine exposure groups. The association of fetal-stage famine exposure with diabetes risk in adults was assessed using logistics regression model. RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes in the non-exposed, fetal-stage exposed, infant-stage exposed, and preschool-stage exposed groups were 9.0, 13.6, 12.7 and 10.8%, respectively. Compared with the age-balanced control group, the fetal-stage exposed group was associated with the elevated risk of diabetes in later life after adjusting for covariates (OR = 1.37; 95%CI: 1.09-1.72; P = 0.008). Stratified analysis showed that the association between prenatal famine exposure and diabetes risk in adulthood was comparable between severely affected areas and less severely affected areas (P for interaction =0.153). CONCLUSIONS: Famine exposure in fetal stages was associated with the elevated diabetes risk in adults, which could be the critical periods for relative intervention.",

Here, we develop a hybrid three-dimensional (3D) computational model that integrates pharmacokinetic model, continuum diffusion-reaction model and discrete cell automaton model to investigate 3D invasive solid tumor growth in heterogeneous microenvironment under chemotherapy. Specifically, we consider the effects of heterogeneous environment on drug diffusion, tumor growth, invasion and the drug-tumor interaction on individual cell level. We employ the hybrid model to investigate the evolution and growth dynamics of avascular invasive solid tumors under different chemotherapy strategies. Our simulations indicate that constant dosing is generally more effective in suppressing primary tumor growth than periodic dosing, due to the resulting continuous high drug concentration. In highly heterogeneous microenvironment, the malignancy of the tumor is significantly enhanced, leading to inefficiency of chemotherapies. The effects of geometrically-confined microenvironment and non-uniform drug dosing are also investigated. Our computational model, when supplemented with sufficient clinical data, could eventually lead to the development of efficient in silico tools for prognosis and treatment strategy optimization.",

The drawback of this buffer is its prescribed limit of 200 mug per recommended application volume in the final formulation. Currently, a TLC test according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) has to be performed for quantification, but this analysis suffers from low reliability and reproducibility and is based on a subjective, semi-quantitative visual evaluation. In this study, the TLC method according to the Ph. Eur. and two literature-known HPLC assays for HEPES quantification were evaluated. Additionally, the development of an improved TLC method was performed. RESULTS: The assay according to Antunes et al. provided a reasonable quantification of HEPES using HPLC. Additionally, a reliable and conclusive TLC method was developed, which facilitates quantitative analysis by means of a pixel-based evaluation. A comparison of those two methods with the Ph. Eur. TLC assay pinpoints the superiority of the HPLC as well as the new TLC assay. Furthermore, evaluation of HEPES contents using both TLC assays by 28 subjects supported the conclusion that the newly developed TLC method is clearly favorable. CONCLUSION: The TLC method according to the Ph. Eur. provides unsatisfactory results in terms of conclusiveness and reproducibility. In contrast, a reported HPLC assay showed valid results, with the drawback of high technical effort. An optimized alternative is provided by the improved TLC method described in this work that results in reliable outcomes and additionally offers quantitative analysis.",

Specifically, the intrinsic free energy of the alkane molecule is tackled by quantum DFT, while the solvent effect arising from the solvent density inhomogeneity in confined space is addressed by classical DFT. By varying the alkane chain length, pore size, and wettability of inner pore surface, we find that pore confinement and hydrophilic inner surface facilitate the alkane conformational change from extended state to helical state, which becomes more significant as the alkane chain length increases. Our findings, which are in line with previous experimental observations, provide not only the microscopic mechanism but also theoretical guidance for elaborately manipulating molecular conformation at the nanoscale.",

METHODS: Thirty patients, average age of 8.5 years ranging from 5 to 13 years, with distal radius extension type fracture and undergoing a failed manual reposition in our hospital were included, and treated by palmar approach with K-wire fixation between May 2014 and December 2017. Among these patients (21 male and 9 female), 5 patients had chronic injuries over 10 days, and 6 patients had fracture of the distal radius epiphysis. The time between injury and treatment ranged from 1 to 30 days. Among them, 11 patients with right-sided fractures and 19 patients with left-sided fractures were operated via the palmar longitudinal incision approach. RESULTS: The results were evaluated after an average of 18 months ranging from 5 to 36 months after operation. The recovery time of fracture was from 4 to 8 weeks and all incisions were primary healing with an average of 6 weeks. Nonunion, delayed union, early closure of distal radial epiphysis, and wrist varus/valgus deformity were not found in all the cases. Based on Gartland and Wereley wrist score assessment undertaken three months after operation, excellent scores were achieved in 24 cases, good scores in 3 cases, acceptable scores in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The palmar approach with K-wire fixation via a front longitudinal incision in the treatment of children's distal radius extension type fracture has following advantages: (1) easy to reposition for both fresh and old fractures; (2) less damage to surrounding tissues and epiphysis; (3) quick recovery. It is suitable to treat children's distal radius extension type fracture.",

        "abstract": "Posttraumatic growth (PTG), the positive psychological transformations that follow traumatic events, affects both direct survivors (primary PTG) and their significant others (secondary PTG). Though primary and secondary PTG have been widely investigated in the literature, their long-term trajectories decades after a traumatic event, especially as survivors enter older age, remain largely uninvestigated. Furthermore, it remains contested whether PTG adds up to a monolithic construct or rather consists of relatively independent components. Addressing these issues, we assessed a sample of Israeli male veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur war (N = 349) and their wives (N = 156) at three time points over the course of nearly three decades. Both the veterans (primary survivors) and their wives (secondary survivors) reported PTG relating to the veterans' experiences during the war and/or captivity. Latent growth mixture modeling was conducted to identify trajectories of PTG on the five subscales of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Long-term trajectories of PTG followed heterogeneous patterns of fluctuation over time and particularly as participants entered older age. On most subscales, decreasing PTG scores were evident, a trend that was more pronounced among the primary survivors than the secondary survivors as primary and secondary PTG fluctuate considerably in the long-term and seem to decrease as individuals enter older age. Furthermore, it would seem that PTG should not be considered a holistic concept but rather a conglomeration of positive changes. Implications of the findings are discussed within the context of limitations and potential intervening factors.",

The present study aimed to determine the prognostic significance of the soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 in patients with HCC. The present study prospectively collected clinicopathological data from 36 patients with HCC who had undergone successful hepatectomy. An analysis using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to determine the cut-off value for predicting prognosis. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The ROC curve analysis revealed a sICAM-1 cut-off value of 440 ng/ml. HCC patients with sICAM-1 >/=440 ng/ml exhibited a poorer OS and RFS than those with sICAM-1 <440 ng/ml (P=0.002). sICAM-1 >/=440 ng/ml (hazard ratio=3.623; 95% confidence interval: 1.145-11.458; P=0.028) and Child B (hazard ratio=1.514; 95% confidence interval: 1.066-2.150; P=0.021) were independent prognostic factors for OS, and sICAM-1 >/=440 ng/ml was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (hazard ratio=3.625; 95% confidence interval: 1.233-10.659; P=0.019).

The EU's recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been seen as a core tool for achieving better governance of this area. While the GDPR does apply to the use of models in some limited situations, most of its provisions relate to the governance of personal data, while models have traditionally been seen as intellectual property. We present recent work from the information security literature around 'model inversion' and 'membership inference' attacks, which indicates that the process of turning training data into machine-learned systems is not one way, and demonstrate how this could lead some models to be legally classified as personal data. Taking this as a probing experiment, we explore the different rights and obligations this would trigger and their utility, and posit future directions for algorithmic governance and regulation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.",

The objective of the present study was to review, compare, and critically appraise medical nutrition therapy guidelines for adult patients with severe burns, and produce salient points for the future update of relevant guidelines. METHODS: A total of 8 clinical practice guidelines developed by the American Burn Association (ABA), the European Burn Association (EBA), the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN), the Midlands National Health Service, the Society for Critical Care Medicine (SCCM)/American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), the Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Coronary Units and Spanish Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, the Indian Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (IAPEN), and the International Society for Burn Injury regarding medical nutrition therapy in burn patients was independently reviewed by a team of 4 multidisciplinary researchers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. RESULTS: From the appraised guidelines, the SCCM/ASPEN guidelines received the greatest scoring in the majority of AGREE domains compared with ABA, EBA, and IAPEN, which obtained the lowest scores. On the other hand, the ESPEN guidelines provided the majority of information concerning nutrition support and medical nutrition therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study identified gaps in most nutrition guidelines and emphasized methodologic issues that could improve the quality of future guidelines concerning nutrition support among adult severe burn patients.",

        "abstract": "Imiquimod (IMQ) is an immunostimulant drug topically used for the treatment of actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma. IMQ formulation and skin delivery is difficult because of its very low solubility in the most of pharmaceutical excipients and very poor skin penetration properties. The purpose of this study was to develop a microemulsion to optimize imiquimod skin delivery using d\u2011alpha\u2011tocopherol polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS) as surfactant (so as to take advantage of its thickening properties) and isostearic acid as oil phase. This fatty acid was selected since it has demonstrated a good solubilizing power for imiquimod and it has also shown to contribute to its therapeutic activity. We have built pseudo-ternary diagrams using two different co-surfactants (Transcutol(R) and propylene glycol - PG) in a 1:1 ratio with TPGS and then selected microemulsions in the clear and viscous regions of the diagrams. The systems were characterized in terms of rheology and X-ray scattering; additionally, the capability to promote IMQ skin uptake was evaluated ex-vivo on a porcine skin model. All the formulations selected in the gel-microemulsion regions behaved as viscoelastic solids; X-rays scattering experiments revealed in all cases the presence of an ordered lamellar structure, but with differences in terms of interlamellar distance and flexibility between Transcutol(R) and PG-containing systems. A higher flexibility and a greater hydrophobic volume, possibly interconnected at some point, was associated to the use of Transcutol(R) and had an impact on the microemulsion capacity to solubilize IMQ as well as on the capability to enhance drug uptake into the skin. The best performing gel-like microemulsion was composed of  approximately 26% of water,  approximately 21% of isostearic acid,  approximately 26% of TPGS and  approximately 27% of Transcutol(R) and accumulated, after 6\u202fh of contact, 3.0\u202f+/-\u202f1.1\u202fmug/cm(2) of IMQ. This value is higher than the one reported in the literature for the commercial cream (1.9\u202f+/-\u202f0.8\u202fmug/cm(2)), despite the 4-times lower concentration of the vehicle (13\u202fmg/g for the microemulsion vs 50\u202fmg/g for the commercial cream).",

HGF was increased especially in male AS patients and smokers and associated with both lower BMD and more chronic radiographic changes in the spine. INTRODUCTION: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is characterized by both osteoproliferation and increased bone loss. Biomarkers are requested to predict the processes. The aims of this study were to compare serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in AS patients with healthy controls (HC) and to explore the associations with disease activity, osteoproliferation, and bone mineral density (BMD). METHODS: Serum from AS patients (modified NY-criteria) and HC was analyzed for HGF, MMP-3, and VEGF with ELISA. Disease activity parameters were collected. Osteoproliferation was assessed with modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) and BMD was measured in femoral neck. RESULTS: Totally, 204 AS patients and 80 sex and age matched HC were included. Serum HGF was higher in the AS patients compared with the HC, whereas serum MMP-3 and VEGF were not. Serum HGF was also higher in smokers and in the male AS patients positively correlated with age, BASMI, and mSASSS, and negatively correlated with BMD. The biomarkers were all positively associated with ESR, CRP, and WBC. In multiple linear regression analysis serum HGF remained associated with higher mSASSS and lower BMD, after adjusting for age, sex, CRP, smoking, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Serum HGF was increased in male AS patients and associated with higher mSASSS and lower BMD. In addition, serum HGF was positively associated with risk factors for osteoproliferation such as age, CRP and smoking. HGF could be a potential biomarker of importance for the bone metabolism in AS.

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among men. Though statins are mainly used as antihyperlipidemic drugs, many studies have reported their proapoptotic and antimetastatic activities on prostate cancer. However, the poor solubility and insufficient delivery of statins in tumor site limit their anticancer activity. The present study introduces an efficient hybrid drug delivery system for the treatment of prostate cancer. The system involves the chemical conjugation of Simvastatin (SMV), a statin compound, to acid-terminated poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid), PLGA chains followed by its conversion into nanoparticles (NPs), with in situ physical incorporation of more SMV and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONS) into the PLGA NPs. The PLGA-based hybrid nanocarrier system has been designed in such a way to evade the low bioavailability of SMV, confer sustained release of both encapsulated and chemically conjugated SMV, as well as enhancing the anti-cancer effect of the formula via the magnetic targeting with the aid of the encapsulated SPIONS. Magnetism, morphological and physicochemical characterizations, as well as in-vitro release studies were performed. Besides, cytotoxicity on human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was evaluated using MTT assay, cell cycle arrest analysis, annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assay and ELISA immunoassay for apoptotic enzyme. Optimum PLGA-based hybrid nanocarrier significantly improved the SMV anticancer activity against human prostate cancer cell line through both apoptosis mechanism and retardation of G2-M phase of cell cycle. Also, the up-regulation of the Caspase 3 was aligned with cytotoxicity study's findings.",

The antinociceptive effect of EVOA has already been demonstrated, and beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) is known to improve the analgesic effect of various substances. PURPOSE: Thus, we aimed to evaluate the orofacial antinociceptive effect of a complex containing EOVA-betaCD in rodents. METHODS: EOVA was obtained by simple hydrodistillation, and the essential oil was complexed with betaCD. The animals (n\u202f=\u202f6/group) were treated orally with EOVA-betaCD (10 or 50\u202fmg/kg), or vehicle (control), and subjected to cutaneous orofacial nociception (formalin, capsaicin, acidic saline or glutamate), corneal (hypertonic saline) or temporomandibular (formalin) tests. The expression of FOS protein was analyzed in the spinal cord. Molecular docking was performed using the 5-HT(3) and M(2) receptors and BISA. RESULTS: The oral administration of EOVA-betaCD reduced nociceptive behaviour. Moreover, EOVA-betaCD decreased FOS expression. The molecular docking study indicates that BISA interacts with 5-HT3 and M2 receptors, indicating the potential mechanism of action of the tested compound. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that EOVA-betaCD possesses orofacial antinociceptive effect, indicating that this complex can be used in analgesic drug development.",

This procedure is often associated with significant but rare postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the types and frequencies of intra- and perioperative complications related to Le Fort I osteotomies in noncleft Iranian patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, all the healthy systemic patients, (ASA I, II) with the age range of 18 to 30 years from both genders, who had the skeletal class II or III deformities and required only isolated 1-piece maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy, were included in this study. These patients had no craniofacial cleft history and were candidates for orthognathic surgery in Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Qaem Hospital of Mashhad (Iran), 2015 to 2017. All of the operations were carried out or supervised by a single surgeon and anesthesiologist using the same protocol. The patients were monitored for occurrence of intra- or postoperative complications till 6 months. The t-test, Chi-squared test, and Fisher exact test were performed for data analysis using SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 114 consecutive patients with the average age of 22 +/- 5 years from October 2015 to November 2017 were recruited. About 77 (67.54%) patients were presented skeletal class III deformity and 37 (32.46%) were class II. The most prevalent maxillary movement after Le Fort I osteotomy was identified to be isolated maxillary advancement in 51 (44.75%) patients. Only 10 (8.77%) of all 114 patients confronted surgical complications. Hemorrhagic complication (arterial bleeding from descending palatine artery and epistaxis) and anatomic complications (septal deviation and bad fracture) would be the most prevalent complications with the frequency of 5.25% and 3.5% in total. Maxillary setback with impaction presented the highest rate (36.4%) of complications compared to other maxillary movement types. On balance, there was a significant association between Le Fort I surgery complications and maxillary movement types in our research (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The rate of intra- and postoperative complications following Le Fort I osteotomy for healthy noncleft adults in our center was low. Therefore, it can be concluded that this technique is safe and reliable. The maxillofacial surgeon should pay more attention for prevention or even management of the risk of intra- and perioperative complications in patients with anatomic irregularities (previous craniofacial cleft or trauma history) and those who required maxillary setback concomitant with impaction movements.",

We present this treatment's effects on InSb(111)B surface and its electronic properties with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Possibility to oxidize (111)B surface with parameters similar to the ones used for (100) surface is found, indicating a generality of the crystalline oxidation among different crystal planes, crucial for utilization in nanotechnology. The outcome is strongly dependent on surface conditions and remarkably, the (111) plane can oxidize without changes in surface lattice symmetry, or alternatively, resulting in a complex, semicommensurate quasicrystal-like structure. The findings are of major significance for passivation via oxide termination for nano-structured III-V/oxide devices containing several crystal plane surfaces. As a proof-of-principle, we present a procedure where InSb(111)B surface is cleaned by simple HCl-etching, transferred via air, and post-annealed and oxidized in ultrahigh vacuum.",

METHOD: Ten women performed 2 water-based protocols (i.e., resistance and concurrent water-based exercises) on separate days. We evaluated isometric force and electromyographic signal (sEMG) before and after protocols and analyzed kinematic parameters during a water-based resistance exercise. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between knee extension force production and sEMG from the vastus lateralis during the maximal voluntary contraction performed before and after the protocols. However, sEMG from the rectus femoris presented a significant difference between pretest and posttest measurements in both water-based protocols with greater values in the measurement after the end of the protocol (p = .046). The peak angular velocity of knee extension and mean angular velocity of knee extension and flexion showed similar values among the sets, with no difference between protocols. The peak angular velocity of knee flexion presented greater values in the water-based resistance exercises compared with the water-based concurrent protocol in the last set (p < .001). CONCLUSION: The main impairment induced by the water-based concurrent exercises was the lower peak angular velocity in the knee flexors compared with water-based resistance exercises alone.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines are useful to suggest pharmacological therapies for the treatment of single chronic diseases. However, there is little guidance for multimorbidity, and specific quality measures for people with multimorbidity that can be used at a population level are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To describe what pharmacists and geriatricians consider to be an optimal basic pharmacological therapy for an older individual with type 2 diabetes (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF). METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey among 162 pharmacists and geriatricians, in Quebec, Canada, was performed. Participants were invited to choose, from a list of 32 medications or classes, the optimal basic therapy for an individual aged 65-75 years with the 3 chronic diseases. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the median number of medications chosen and the proportions of participants who chose each medication, according to the participant's specialty. A Kruskall-Wallis test was performed to detect whether there were differences in the median number of medications recommended according to speciality. RESULTS: There was little consensus on the optimal basic pharmacological therapy for this hypothetical multimorbid individual, with 157 different combinations provided by the 162 participants. Nevertheless, 5 classes were chosen by at least 75% of the participants: metformin, long-acting anticholinergic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and short-acting beta-agonists. The median number of recommended medications was 10 (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-13). There was a statistically significant difference between specialties (p\u202f=\u202f0.0396). Geriatricians recommended the lower median number of medications, 7 (IQR: 5-10). CONCLUSIONS: At least half of the participants considered polypharmacy (>/=10 medications) inevitable for an optimal basic treatment of DM, COPD and HF. The heterogeneity of responses raises issues when considering quality indicators in population-based studies.",

METHODS: We used data from the national registry in Scotland, Scottish Care Information-Diabetes, linked to hospital admissions. Using descriptive statistics and logistic regression we described associations of risk factors with CVD. CVD was defined based on diagnostic codes in primary or secondary care data for ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertensive heart disease and revascularization procedures. RESULTS: Among 248 400 people with Type 2 diabetes with a median age of 67.5 years (IQR 58.2, 76.1) and median diabetes duration of 7.8 years (3.8, 13.0), 32% had prior CVD (35% of men, 29% of women). Median HbA(1c) overall was 55 mmol/mol (7.2%), median SBP was 132 mmHg, median total cholesterol was 4.1 mmol/l and mean BMI was 32 kg/m(2) (.) Overall two-thirds (65% of men, 68% of women) have two or more of the following CVD risk factor thresholds: HbA(1c) >/= 53 mmol/mol (7%), SBP > 130 mmHg or DBP > 80 mmHg, total cholesterol >/= 5 mmol/l or BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2) , or were currently smoking. Overall 84% were taking anti-hypertensives and 75% a statin. Use of metformin was common at 58%, but other diabetes drugs that reduce CVD were rarely used. CONCLUSIONS: There continues to be a high prevalence of CVD among people with Type 2 diabetes and a high level of unmet need for risk factor control. This implies substantial scope for reducing the excess risk of CVD in diabetes through improved management of known risk factors.",

Here, we improved and optimized the methods of silver phosphate preparation for oxygen isotope analysis from soils and sediments. During our preparations, organic matter was removed by sodium hypochlorite and XAD-2 resin, while the impurities of elemental silver and its oxide were removed by rapid microprecipitation and ammonium phospho-molybdate and magnesium ammonium phosphate. The total organic carbon and total nitrogen in the prepared silver phosphates from soils and sediments were 0.226+/-0.033% and 0.030+/-0.0059% (n = 7), 0.217+/-0.053% and 0.034+/-0.0120% (n = 9), respectively, indicating a high removal efficiency of organic matter. We confirmed that adding citric acid during rapid microprecipitation would introduce the impurity of elemental silver, which could be removed by ammonia recrystallization. The pH range of solutions for rapid microprecipitation was optimized at 7.0\u20127.5. Results of X-ray Diffraction and stable oxygen isotope analyses showed that the improved method could obtain high pure silver phosphate from soil and sediment samples without oxygen isotope fractionation. This improved procedure provides a foundation for biogeochemical studies on phosphorus in soil and lacustrine environments by using phosphate oxygen isotopes.",

The study objective was to evaluate the effects of MSP on the regulation of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators in an I/R-induced acute kidney injury rat model. Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups. Sham and I/R were given 1 mL/day of physiological solution; MSP+I/R was given intragastric MSP (300 mug/kg) for 3 days. For I/R and MSP+IR, the renal hilum was clamped for 45 min, followed by 15 h of reperfusion. Renal function tests, pro-inflammatory cytokines, mediators of oxidative stress, and histological analysis were evaluated. Pro-inflammatory cytokine activity was significantly attenuated in the MSP+I/R group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between Sham and MSP. Regarding antioxidant activity, MSP+I/R showed a significant decrease in these mediators compared with Sham and I/R.

Although there are large number of drugs that can be used for the treatment of cancer, the problem is selective and specific killing of cancerous cells without harming the normal cells. There are some biological barriers to potential drug delivery in cancer cells like hepatic, renal, abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix, and high interstitial fluid pressure. The physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles (NPs) such as size, shape, and surface charge may also have significant effects on tumor penetration. NPs coated with drug can be used to overcome these biological barriers to enhance targeted delivery. This literature survey encompasses the biological barriers to potential drug delivery in cancer cells, elaborate on designing strategies to enhance NPs penetration and distribution inside the tumor interstitium. Scientists are now doing great efforts to design next-generation of nanomedicines (NMs) that need to be better targeted with high specificity and efficacy to kill cancer cells. These challenges need to be overcome through collaborations among academia, pharmaceutical industries, and regulatory agencies to eradicate this global menace. Furthermore, this review article has critically discussed the recent developments, controversies, challenges, emerging concepts, and future perspectives in cancer NMs.",

The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview of major writings dealing with adjuvant (non-pharmacological) treatments associated with botulinum toxin for managing spasticity in order to provide some up-to-date information about the usefulness of the most commonly used procedures. METHODS: The literature in PubMed was searched with the MeSH terms botulinum toxins, muscle spasticity, physical therapy modalities, and rehabilitation. The results were limited to studies focusing on adjuvant treatments associated with botulinum toxin for managing spasticity. We excluded papers on the use of non-drug treatments for spasticity not associated with botulinum toxin serotype A (BoNT-A) injection. Relevant literature known to the authors along with this complementary search represented the basis for this overview of the literature. RESULTS: Adhesive taping and casting effectively improved the botulinum toxin effect in patients with upper- and lower-limb spasticity. There is level 1 evidence that casting is better than taping for outcomes including spasticity, range of motion and gait. However, consensus about their most appropriate timing, duration, target and material is lacking. In terms of physical modalities combined with botulinum toxin injection, we found level 1 evidence that extracorporeal shock wave therapy is better than electrical stimulation for some post-injection outcomes including spasticity and pain. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of injected muscles might be useful to boost the toxin effect. However, the best stimulation protocol has not been defined. In addition, we found level 2b evidence that whole-body vibration therapy might reduce spasticity with cerebral palsy. CONCLUSION: Future research in this field should focus on investigating the most appropriate post-injection treatment protocol for each goal to achieve.",

In this study, we compared quantitative EEG parameters between patients with temporal slowing with no signs of neurological disease and controls to evaluate cortical function in the temporal lobes and other cerebral regions. We also compared the width of the temporal lobes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Mean dominant frequency and relative power in delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands were examined in 20 patients older than 60 years with intermittent temporal slowing and 20 age-matched controls without significant lesions on MRI or medical conditions known to affect the EEG. Furthermore, the correlation between the frequency of temporal slowing and the mean dominant frequency and the width of the medial temporal lobes on MRI were examined. RESULTS: Mean dominant frequency and the relative power in the beta frequency band was lower in patients with temporal slowing than in controls in all of the cortical regions examined. No significant correlation was found between the frequency of slowing and the mean dominant frequency. There was no significant difference in the width of the medial temporal lobes. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent temporal slowing was correlated with diffusely reduced mean dominant frequency and a shift in relative power to lower frequency bands. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that subclinical diffuse cerebral pathology may be present in subjects with intermittent temporal slowing, but prospective studies including tests of cognitive function, cerebral perfusion, metabolic status, and advanced neuroimaging should be conducted.",

This prospective study was conducted at Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during the November 2013-November 2016. SSc patients by ACR/EULAR 2013 or ACR 1980 criteria were eligible. TA-mRSS was classified as low, intermediate, or high, and then compared between groups. Correlation between the arithmetic mean of laboratory tests and TA-mRSS was assessed by multiple linear regression analysis. A total of 118 patients, with 81.4% women, median (IQR) age 49.8 (43.8, 55.1) years, disease duration from onset of non-Raynaud symptoms to first visit of 3.3 (1, 6.8) years, 78% dcSSc, and 75.3% anti-Scl-70 positivity, were analyzed. TA-mRSS over 1 year ranged from 0 to 37.44. The high skin sclerosis burden group had a median TA-mRSS > 7.26 (> 67th percentile). Patients with high TA-mRSS were dcSSc, high initial and average mRSS, and had tendon friction rub, digital ischemic complications, usual interstitial pneumonia, diastolic dysfunction, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and low serum albumin. In multiple linear regression analysis, the arithmetic mean of hemoglobin (B = - 1.007, 95% CI - 1.779 to - 0.236), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (B = - 0.078, 95% CI - 0.126 to - 0.029), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (B = 0.073, 95% CI 0.026-0.12), creatine phosphokinase (B = 0.012, 95% CI 0.003-0.021), and albumin (B = - 4.117, 95% CI - 6.958 to - 1.276) were associated with TA-mRSS. This study found a higher cumulative course of mRSS over a 1-year period to be significantly associated with severe internal organ involvement.",

Thus, the goal of this study was to unravel the evolution of the GDF1 and GDF3 genes of vertebrates, emphasizing the understanding of homologous relationships and their evolutionary origin. Our results revealed that the GDF1 and GDF3 genes found in anurans and mammals are the products of independent duplication events of an ancestral gene in the ancestor of each of these lineages. The main implication of this result is that the GDF1 and GDF3 genes of anurans and mammals are not 1:1 orthologs. In other words, genes that participate in fundamental processes during early development have been reinvented two independent times during the evolutionary history of tetrapods.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D analogs have been widely utilized for the treatment of vitiligo, but the molecular mechanism underlying their pharmacological effects (especially their antioxidant properties) has not yet been investigated. We evaluated the relationship between serum vitamin D level and oxidative damage severity in vitiligo patients, and investigated the molecular mechanism of vitamin D in protecting melanocytes against oxidative stress. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and malondialdehyde (MDA) were first measured in patients. A variety of in vitro experiments such as intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), cellular viability, migration, and apoptotic assays were then performed to detect the effects of vitamin D or beta-catenin silencing on H(2)O(2)-treated melanocytes. Expression of Wnt/beta-catenin, Nrf2, apoptotic, and MITF pathways was finally examined using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. In this study, we initially found that vitamin D insufficiency was closely associated with the severity of oxidative stress in vitiligo patients. Using ex vivo cell models, we further showed that vitamin D positively modulated beta-catenin signaling at both translational and posttranslational levels in melanocytes under oxidative stress. Like WNT agonists, vitamin D significantly inhibited ROS accumulation and cell apoptosis in H(2)O(2)-treated melanocytes and promoted their proliferative and migratory activity, while the protective effects of vitamin D against oxidative stress were abolished by beta-catenin silencing in melanocytes. Furthermore, beta-catenin deficiency also blocked the activation of Nrf2 and MITF as well as the inhibition of apoptosis induced by vitamin D. Taken together, vitamin D insufficiency was associated with severity of oxidative stress in vitiligo patients. Our work also provides new insights into the mechanism of vitamin D against vitiligo, in which vitamin D protects melanocytes against oxidative stress by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this paper is to examine effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention in community settings, and the factors associated with effectiveness. Limited research in the area of HIV prevention has focused on evaluating intervention program effectiveness in real-world settings. METHODS: We implemented an efficacious theory-based sexual risk reduction intervention for female sex workers (FSW) called Mujer Segura across 13 different clinics in 13 sites across Mexico. The overall design was a cluster randomized Type I design simultaneously testing intervention program effectiveness with an observational study of implementation factors. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of Mujer Segura at reducing HIV/STI incidence among FSW participants at each site, and to examine the client-, provider-, organization-, and structure-related factors associated with program effectiveness. RESULTS: We found lower HIV/STI incidence density in the intervention relative to the control group in 5 sites we labeled as \"program effective sites,\" but not in 8 sites we labeled as \"program ineffective sites.\" Using generalized estimating equations controlling for site and computed mean difference effect sizes, we examined statistically and practically significant differences, respectively, between the two groups of sites along various client-, provider-, organization-, and structure-related characteristics. Results indicated that client-level HIV/AIDS related knowledge, and proficiency and engagement in the organizational social context were associated with program effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Enormous resources are required to systematically and adequately test the role of multilevel factors on program effectiveness. We successfully implemented Mujer Segura in 13 sites in Mexico. Results suggest that other measures may need to be included in future implementation studies than the ones included here. We were able to point to a few specific factors that should be targeted to increase effectiveness of similar evidence-based programs in low- and other middle-income countries like Mexico.

This is the case for children with theorised phonetic and motor disorders, such as children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS, e.g., Ekelman & Aram, 1983; McNeill & Gillon, 2013 ). The morphological skills of children with CAS remain relatively unexplored in pre-schoolers. We investigated English morphology in a retrospective, cross-sectional design of 26 children aged 4-5 years who completed the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool (2nd edition; Wiig, Secord & Semel, 2006). The research aims were to determine: (1) the language profile of the children, (2) the accuracy of each morpheme type produced, and (3) how many of those morphological errors are explained by speech errors (clusters, late developing phonemes, central vowels or weak syllable stress)? The results indicate the group of children with CAS had poorer expressive language skills than receptive skills and 48% demonstrated difficulties with morphology in word structure and recalling sentences subtests. The children had poor accuracy and inconsistent production of a range of morphemes and despite many errors due to the speech characteristics of the stimuli on the CELF-P2, motor speech concerns could not explain all the child's morphological errors. The results suggest morphological difficulties are co-morbid to CAS and when this occurs, treatment for morphosyntax is indicated. There are also significant clinical implications in the assessment of morphosyntax for children with CAS which are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Hybridization is a widespread phenomenon present in numerous lineages across the tree of life. Its evolutionary consequences range from effects on the origin and maintenance, to the loss of biodiversity. We studied genetic diversity and intra- and interspecific gene flow between two sympatric populations of closely-related species, Pitcairnia flammea and P. corcovadensis (Bromeliaceae), which are adapted to naturally fragmented Neotropical inselbergs, based on nuclear and plastidial DNA. Our main results indicate a strong reproductive isolation barrier, although low levels of interspecific gene flow were observed in both sympatric populations. The low rates of intraspecific gene flow observed for both P. corcovadensis and P. flammea populations corroborate the increasing body of evidence that inselberg bromeliad species are maintained as discrete evolutionary units despite the presence of low genetic connectivity. Nuclear patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow revealed that hybridization and introgression might not cause species extinction via genetic assimilation of the rare P. corcovadensis. In the face of reduced intraspecific gene exchange, hybridization and introgression may be important aspects of the Pitcairnia diversification process, with a positive evolutionary impact at the bromeliad community level, and thus contribute to increasing and maintaining genetic diversity in local isolated inselberg populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arthrofibrosis after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common complication, potentially occurring in up to 25% of patients, and may be treated during the early recovery period by manipulation under anesthesia (MUA). The majority of preoperative factors that predispose patients to postoperative stiffness are patient specific and not modifiable. The United States Veteran Affairs is a particularly challenging group given a higher baseline rate of medical comorbidities and opioid dependence than the general population. Patient education about postoperative expectations and complications has been shown to improve outcomes in certain orthopedic procedures. This retrospective study aims to determine if preoperative counseling for veterans undergoing primary TKA reduces the rate of postoperative stiffness, and consequently MUA, in this subset of patients. METHODS: We evaluated the medical records of 244 veterans at a single veteran affairs hospital who underwent 278 TKAs during a 6-year period under one surgeon. Patients were separated into groups based on attendance in the preoperative counseling session. Effects of various factors, including age, sex, body mass index, preoperative knee range of motion, and history of previous knee surgery, were compared between these 2 cohorts. RESULTS: Attendance in the preoperative course did not have a statistically significant impact on the rate of manipulation (odds ratio [OR], 1.07). Female gender and prior manipulation had an increased OR of knee manipulation, whereas age > 65 years had a decreased OR that did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that preoperative counseling did not have a benefit in terms of postoperative MUA rates in veterans. Preoperative education may be helpful for setting appropriate expectations of pain, recovery, and function after total joint arthroplasty and may be useful in an online or video format in small practices in which cost may be prohibitive. Further studies are needed to determine whether they provide any benefit in postoperative arthrofibrosis rates.",

In this study, we determined the prevalence and characteristics of plasmids coharboring mcr-1, oqxAB, and bla(CTX-M) as well as those harboring oqxAB and bla(CTX-M) in Escherichia coli from food-producing animals. We isolated 493 E. coli strains, and mcr-1, bla(NDM), and bla(CTX-M) were present in 140 (28.4%), 51 (10.3%), and 195 (39.6%) of the isolates, respectively. The two most prevalent plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were oqxAB (34.5%) and qnrS (29.4%). Nine IncHI2/ST3 plasmids co-carrying mcr-1, oqxAB, and bla(CTX-M) were found, and similar IncHI2/ST3 plasmids mediated dissemination of these resistance genes. Two sequenced MDR IncHI2/ST3 plasmids coharboring mcr-1, oqxAB, and bla(CTX-M) showed high similarity to reference plasmid pHNSHP45-2, although they were from different regions in China. Colocalization of oqxAB and bla(CTX-M) on the same plasmid was found in 28 isolates, including the nine plasmids harboring mcr-1. The co-dissemination of oqxAB and bla(CTX-M) was mediated by diverse F33:A-:B- plasmids and similar IncHI2/ST3 plasmids. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing analysis of donor isolates revealed heterogeneous patterns indicating that clonal dissemination was unlikely. The high incidence of similar IncHI2/ST3 plasmids simultaneously possessing mcr-1, oqxAB, and bla(CTX-M) poses a great threat to public health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent drug-related deaths at Australian music festivals have led to increasing concern about the risk of future harm, but contention about how to effectively respond. One hotly debated strategy has been the use of drug detection dogs which currently operate at festivals across Australia, despite claims they are ineffective and contribute to risky drug use practices. This paper aims to investigate responses to the expected presence, and sightings, of drug dogs at the last festival attended. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was completed by almost 2000 Australian festival-goers. The largest subsample used in the analyses for this paper (n= 647) was 59% male and had a median age of 20 (IQR = 18-22). RESULTS: Of those who expected dogs to be present at their last festival (n= 647), only 4% reported that this threat led them to decide not to take drugs. Other responses included: concealing their drugs well (48%), getting someone else to carry their drugs (15%), buying their drugs inside (11%), taking less easily detected drugs (10%) and taking drugs before entering (7%). Of those who carried drugs in (n= 418), 10% concealed them internally and 1% swallowed them to retrieve inside. Of those who had drugs on their person when seeing a dog (n= 189), 10% reported consuming drugs in response. No respondents reported being detected with drugs due to a positive identification. CONCLUSION: Almost all festival-goers surveyed did not report being deterred from drug usage by the expected presence of drug dogs. Instead, a variety of alternative responses to avoid detection were reported, many of which could place festival-goers at greater risk of experiencing drug-related harms. In the face of mounting evidence of both ineffectiveness and iatrogenic effects, the use of drug detection dogs at Australian music festivals should be urgently reconsidered.",

        "abstract": "Background: Iran is located in Asian esophageal cancer belt, with age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of approximately 7 per 100,000 for both men and women. To provide potential solution recommendations for achieving accurate estimations regarding the burden of the disease in Iran, we designed a study to assess the burden of esophageal cancer in Iran during 1995-2015 by collecting data from the Global Burden of Disease studies. Methods: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) during 1995-2015, which were published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. For this purpose, disability adjusted life years (DALYs), incidence, and prevalence rate were applied to report burden of esophageal cancer based on gender and age group in Iran during 1995-2015. The Cochran-Armitage and t test were used to assess statistical significance. Stata Version 13 and Excel 2016 were used for data analysis. Results: During 1995-2015, in total, 304 102 DALYs (179 562 for males vs. 124 540 for females) were attributed to esophageal cancer in Iran. In both genders and all ages, the number of DALYs increased significantly from 45 018 in 1995 to 74 399 in 2015. Conclusion: Esophageal cancer is still a public health issue in Iran. Most of DALYs were due to years of life lost (YLL), suggesting the need for prevention, early detection, and screening programs. P-value was statistically significant just between male and female groups (p<0.05).",

Among the synthesized derivatives, 12a exhibited reversible and potent inhibition (IC(50)\u202f=\u202f0.41\u202fmuM) and high selectivity over the MAO-A and MAO-B. Notably, 12a strongly induced differentiation effect on acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line and distinctly escalated the methylation level on histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4).

        "abstract": "In this work, we report a novel class of a commercially available surfactant which shows a multistimuli-responsive behavior toward foam stability. It comprises three components-a hydrophobe (tristyrylphenol), a temperature-sensitive block (polypropylene oxide, PO), and a pH-sensitive moiety (carboxyl group). The hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity balance of the surfactant can be tuned by changing either the pH or temperature of the system. At or below pH 4, the carboxyl functional group is dominantly protonated, resulting in zero foamability. At higher pH, the surfactant exhibits good foamability and foam stability marked with a fine bubble texture ( approximately 200 mum). Foam destabilization could be achieved rapidly by either lowering the pH or bubbling CO(2) gas. At a fixed pH in the presence of salt, increasing the temperature to 65  degrees C resulted in rapid defoaming because of the increased hydrophobicity of the PO chain. This stimuli-induced stabilization and destabilization of foam were found to be reversible. We envisage the use of such a multi-responsive foaming system in diverse applications such as foam-enhanced oil recovery and environmental remediation where spatial and temporal control over foam stability is desirable. The low-cost commercial availability of the surfactant further makes it lucrative.",

Thence, we designed the remarkable SERS platform (AuNPs/WS(2)@AuNPs hybrids) by introducing bilayer WS(2) film as the precise nanospacer. Bilayer WS(2) film can realize the facile and tight combination with AuNPs via the thermal decomposition approach. Dense three-dimension (3D) hot spots provided by this hybrid plasmonic nanostructures are responsible for the extremely satisfying SERS performances. Using rhodamine 6G (R6G) as the probe molecules, the AuNPs/WS(2)@AuNPs hybrids perform the excellent sensitivity with the minimum detectable concentration as low as 10(-11) M. Uniform and reproducible SERS signals illustrate that the synthesized SERS hybrids perform the splendid spot-to-spot reproducibility (RSD~5.4%) and substrate-to-substrate reproducibility (RSD~5.7%). The stability of AuNPs and the protection of WS(2) film endow this hybrid plasmonic nanostructures with the brilliant anti-oxidation stability. Moreover, the enhanced electric field distribution simulated with the COMSOL software proves the remarkable SERS performance in theory. Therefore, AuNPs/WS(2)@AuNPs substrate not only widens the SERS research filed of WS(2), but also shows vast potential as excellent SERS sensor for practical applicability.",

The strain grew optimally at 0.5 M NaCl and 16:8 h L:D photoperiod along with maintaining low level of intracellular Na(+) even at higher salinity, emphasizing special features of its cell membranes. It was observed that the cells experienced stress beyond 2 M NaCl as evidenced by increased intracellular reactive oxygen species and antioxidative enzymes, nevertheless proline and malondialdehyde content declined sharply accompanied by higher neutral lipid accumulation. Salinity exceeding 2 M resulted decrease in photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and enhanced glycerol synthesis accompanied by leakage. Super oxide dismutase seemed to play a pivotal role in antioxidative defense as eight isoforms were expressed differentially while catalase and glutathione peroxidase showing no significant change in their expression at higher salinity. The ability of D. salina to grow in range of salinities by sustaining healthy photosynthetic apparatus along with accumulation of valuable products made this alga an ideal organism that can be exploited as resource for biofuel and commercial products.",

This study aimed to analyze the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (GRM7) gene with ARHI in an elderly population in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a community-based study performed in a metropolitan hospital. Participants >/=65 years of age were recruited. Participants with a pure tone average (PTA) of speech frequencies in the better ear of >35 decibel hearing level (dBHL) were classified into the case group, whereas those with PTA </=25 dBHL were classified into the control group. The association of SNPs rs11928865, rs1353828, rs9814809, and rs9880404 with ARHI was analyzed. RESULTS: In 106 cases and 190 controls, alleles of all SNPs were found not to be associated with ARHI. The genotype of rs9880404 was found to be associated with ARHI in a dominant pattern, but the genotypes of rs11928865, rs1353828, and rs9814809 were found not to be associated with ARHI. CONCLUSION: GRM7 SNPs are associated with susceptibility to ARHI, but the significance of this finding in a Taiwanese population differed from that observed in European studies. Further studies may help to determine Taiwanese (Asian)-specific SNPs associated with ARHI.",

A total of 818 stool specimens were obtained from outpatients (n = 45) and hospitalized patients (n = 773) in Tehran, Iran, from 2011 to 2017. The 44 C. difficile isolates were subjected to PCR of toxin C. difficile A (tcdA), toxin C. difficile B (tcdB), tcdA 3'-end deletion, toxinotyping and sequencing of the tcdC gene. Thirty-eight isolates (86.36%) were identified as tcdA and tcdB positive, and the remaining six isolates (13.63%) were nontoxigenic. All tcdA- and tcdB-positive isolates yielded an amplicon of 2535 bp by PCR for the tcdA 3' end. Fourteen (36.84%), seventeen (44.73%) and seven (18.43%) isolates belonged to wild-type, toxin C. difficile C subclone3 (tcdC-sc3) and tcdC-A genotype of tcdC, respectively. Thirty-one isolates (81.57%) belonged to toxinotype 0, and seven isolates (18.42%) were classified as toxinotype V. This study provides evidence for the circulation of historical and hypervirulent isolates in the healthcare and community settings. Furthermore, it was also demonstrated that the tcdC-A genotype and toxinotype V are not uncommon among Iranian C. difficile isolates.",

        "abstract": "Conceptions of acute public health events typically assume that they are tackled exclusively or principally through technical and medical solutions. Yet health and politics are inexorably linked. To better understand this link, this paper adopts a disaster diplomacy perspective for analysing and assessing the impacts of acute public health events on diplomatic outcomes. Two gaps in understanding disaster-health-politics connections are addressed: (i) how health interventions can impact diplomatic endeavours, especially for (ii) acute public health events. Three diverse case studies are interpreted from a disaster diplomacy perspective: Cuba's medical diplomacy, China and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and polio vaccination. Disaster diplomacy permits deeper investigation and analysis of connections amongst health, disaster, and diplomatic activities by viewing efforts on acute public health events as being political through disaster risk reduction (beforehand) and disaster response (during and afterwards). Understanding improves how health interventions affect diplomacy and on disaster diplomacy's limitations.",

The beliefs that outbreak of epilepsy as an unnatural or supernatural activities can be most frequently seen in rural population. One cannot say that the perception of urban populace is different from that of rural populace, but yes, they do differ at some extent. OBJECTIVE: Knowledge, superstition, and myth toward epilepsy in North India. METHODS: This is a questionnaire-based study (12 questions) conducted in neurology outpatient department of Banaras Hindu University, visited by more than hundreds of people from different province of northern India. This survey was also conducted in nearby areas of holy city Varanasi. People belonging to different socioeconomic background and educational level were surveyed to know their view regarding epilepsy. RESULTS: In this survey conducted by our team, we came to the truth that urban population do consider epilepsy as an unnatural phenomenon and adopted different treatment tactics as given in this article. CONCLUSION: There is the urgent need of creating awareness among the common people through different means such as newspaper, television, organizing health camps, and training local health practitioners for epilepsy management.",

Hence, this study examined longitudinal associations between child eating and drinking engagement at 27 months of age and child eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) at 33 months of age (N\u202f=\u202f91 children; 57.1% boys). At 27 months of age, we coded child eating and drinking engagement during a videotaped naturalistic lunch meal at home. We also obtained mothers' reports of their child's food responsiveness (FR), satiety responsiveness (SR), and desire to drink (DD) using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ). Children participated in a standard EAH protocol at 27 and 33 months of age where they were presented with palatable foods and the amount of food eaten was assessed (calculated as total kilocalories consumed). Correlational analyses showed that EAH at 27 months of age was positively related to EAH at 33 months of age and that neither mother-reported child FR or SR were associated with child eating engagement. Mother-reported child DD was associated with child drinking engagement. To predict EAH at 33 months, a regression analysis was conducted in which EAH at 27 months, mother-reported and observed child eating and drinking engagement at 27 months were entered as predictors, controlling for child demographics (i.e., age, sex, race/ethnicity and weight-for-length z-score (WLZ). Findings were that children who were observed to engage in more drinking at 27 months of age consumed more energy (measured as kcal) in the EAH at 33 months of age. Implications for understanding eating, and drinking, behaviors in toddlerhood are discussed.",

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is used to detoxify users of illicit opiates, but drug relapse is common and associated with poor quality of life (QoL). This study investigated the associations between the GRIN3A, GRM6, and TPH2 genetic variants and QoL in the MMT population. A total of 319 participants were included in the study, and genotyping of GRIN3A, GRM6, and TPH2 genes was performed using the Sequenom iPLEX. Associations between genotypes and the domains of QoL were examined through posthoc analysis with LSMEANS syntax using SAS 9.1.3. The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs9325202 and rs1487275 in the TPH2 gene were significantly associated with the QoL domain of physical functioning. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression model revealed that the risk allele rs1487275-G was significantly correlated with the domain of physical functioning when clinical characteristics were considered as covariates. The results of the present study illuminate the importance of the genetic basis of QoL in the MMT population, and suggest that genotypes should be considered as a potential QoL indicator.",

AIM: To assess outpatient IHR practice in France and to identify predictive factors of selection and failure of ambulatory procedures. METHOD: Surgeons of the French \"Club Hernie\" prospectively gathered data concerning IHR over a period of almost 5years within a nationwide database. RESULTS: A number of patients (1429) were operated on during the period of the study. The mean age was 63.3 (22-97) years old. An ambulatory procedure was planned in 305 (21%) patients. Among these, 272 (89%) IHR were effectively performed as one-day procedures. Upon multivariate analysis, predictive factors influencing practitioners for not propose an ambulatory care were increasing age (OR 0.97, P<0.001), body mass index (OR 0.95, P<0.001), ASA grade>/=III (OR 0.23, P<0.001), hernia width>/=4cm (OR 0.44, P<0.001), recurrent hernia (OR 0.55, P=0.01) and a laparoscopic IHR (OR 0.54, P<0.001). A number of patients (1157) were not selected preoperatively for outpatient IHR mainly because of organizational issues or an ASA grade>/=III. Medical or social reasons were the main causes of failure of initially planned ambulatory settings. CONCLUSION: Ambulatory IHR is a safe and feasible practice subject to a good preoperative selection of the patients. Increasing age, body mass index, ASA grade>/=III, hernia width>/=4cm, recurrent hernia and a laparoscopic IHR were identified to be preoperative factors for not proposing an ambulatory care. One-day surgery for IHR could be systematically proposed for IHR of small incisional hernias (<4cm) in young patients with few comorbidities.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we investigate, using direct numerical simulation, the motion of a small bubble in a horizontal microchannel filled with a liquid containing surfactants. In particular, we study the combined effect of surfactants and bubble deformability on the bubble shape, bubble-liquid relative velocity, velocity field in the liquid, liquid velocity on the gas-liquid interface, and surfactant distribution on the interface. The level-set method is used to capture the gas-liquid interface. The surfactant transport equation on the gas-liquid interface is solved in an Eulerian framework and is coupled to an equation describing the transport of surfactants inside the liquid phase. The Marangoni stress, induced by surfactant concentration gradients, is computed using the continuum surface force model. The simulation results give insights into the complexity of the coupling of the different phenomena controlling the dynamics of the studied system. For instance, the results show that for values of the capillary number much smaller than unity, that is, for spherical bubbles, the bubble velocity decreases as the bubble diameter increases. Moreover, surfactants tend to decrease significantly the bubble velocity, when compared with a bubble with a clean surface. Indeed, they accumulate at a convergent stagnation point/circle on the bubble surface and deplete at a divergent stagnation point/circle. As a consequence, the velocity of the liquid adjacent to the bubble is reduced in between the convergent and divergent stagnation points/circles because of Marangoni stresses. It is shown that regarding the bubble-liquid relative velocity, the bubble behaves as a rigid sphere when the Langmuir number is larger than unity, at least for the range of parameters explored in this study. For values of the capillary number of the order of unity, the bubble can take a \"bullet shape\". In this case, the bubble velocity increases as the bubble diameter increases. This increase of the bubble-liquid relative velocity is linked to a drastic change in the liquid flow structure near the bubble. Surfactants are swept to the rear of the bubble and have less influence on the bubble dynamics than for spherical bubbles. Finally, it is shown that increasing the amount of surfactants adsorbing to the surface eventually leads to the bursting of the bubble.",

Enucleation of cystic lesions in the jaw produces bone defects, which may recover spontaneously or with assisted healing with the use of autogenous bone graft or other bone substitute materials. This clinical study presents a spontaneous bone regeneration after residual cyst enucleation in the distal part of the maxilla. The progress of recovery is followed by clinical and radiographic examination and subjective data obtained from the patient. Bone regeneration and cystic cavity reduction was observed in the panoramic image after six months and after one year.

MPD acts on brain structures of the reward/motivation system, including the caudate nucleus (CN). The objective of this study was to investigate the acute and chronic dose response effects of MPD on CN neurons in freely behaving adolescent rats. Semi-microelectrodes were implanted into the CN of one hundred and sixty-three adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats. On experimental day one (ED1), each rat was injected with 0.8\u202fml saline followed by an injection of MPD (0.6, 2.5, or 10.0\u202fmg/kg). Behavioral and neuronal recordings of 60\u202fmin followed each injection. Throughout ED2-6, each rat remained in its home cage and received daily injections of a specific dose of MPD. ED7-9 consisted of a three-day washout period during which no injections were given. On the last day (ED10), each rat was returned to the testing chamber in its home cage and an identical protocol was performed as on ED1. The same repetitive (i.e. chronic) dose of MPD elicited behavioral sensitization in some animals and behavioral tolerance in others. After chronic MPD exposure, CN units recorded from rats expressing behavioral sensitization responded mainly with increased neuronal firing rates. Conversely, rats expressing behavioral tolerance responded mainly with decreased neuronal firing rates. These findings suggest a direct correlation between the behavioral and CN neurophysiological response to chronic MPD in adolescent animals.",

METHODS: An electronic questionnaire was developed and sent to 36,817 pharmacists; 3723 (11%) responded representing a broad cross-section of practice settings and job roles. Forty-eight attributes were analyzed, 24 character traits and 24 markers of academic success. Respondents identified: 1) the relative importance the possession of each attribute would play in the decision to hire an applicant; 2) the relative importance the lack of possession of the attribute would play on the decision to hire an applicant; 3) the 10 most important attributes used when considering an applicant, and; 4) the 10 least important attributes used when considering an applicant. After investigating the relative importance of the 48 traits, a factor analysis to further group the traits was undertaken. RESULTS: Character traits were consistently ranked higher than academic traits, both in importance and as more likely to effect the hiring decision. Additionally, \"the top ten most important attributes\" were dominated by character traits and \"the top ten least important attributes\" used in the hiring of an entry-level pharmacist were dominated by the academic traits. A factor analysis provided further evidence of the distinction of the character traits from the academic success markers. CONCLUSION: When selecting employees from a pool of qualified applicants, the most important attributes used in hiring decision relate to the character of the pharmacist. The results are similar across all practice settings and types of respondents completing the survey.",

The model is minimal (semi-mechanistic) with just enough detail that all relevant therapeutic effects can be represented. The regimens are optimized to yield the highest possible reduction in disease burden, taking into account dosing constraints and side effect risks due to drug exposure. We compare the following three types of regimens: (1) regimens that are restricted to certain discrete dose levels, which can only change every three months; (2) optimal regimens determined using optimal control; and (3) regimens that are piecewise-constant like the first type of regimen, but are obtained as approximations to the optimal control regimens. All three types of regimens result in similar outcomes, but the last one is easy to compute in addition to being clinically feasible.",

T. amblypharyngodoni sp. n. is characterized by having a large, darkly stained central area; rectangularly-rounded butterspoon-shaped blade with very narrow interblade space and blunt tangent point; indistinct anterior and posterior blade apophysis, but a rounded apex near the base of the central part of denticle; slender, sometimes slightly triangular central part with rounded tip; and filamentous, curved, anteriorly directed rays with inflated tip and indistinct central groove. Based on these characters and the unique shape and absence of variability of the denticles among the silver impregnated specimens of the present species, it may be said that to a lesser extent, it resembles Trichodina prowazeki Grupcheva and Lom, 1980.",

Despite the high biological relevance of guanine oxidation and seminal recent advances in sequencing bulky adducts, single-nucleotide-resolution whole genome mapping of oxidative damage is not yet realized. We coupled the specificity of repair enzymes with the efficiency of a click DNA ligation reaction to insert a biocompatible locator code, enabling high-throughput, nucleotide-resolution sequencing of oxidative DNA damage in a genome. We uncovered thousands of oxidation sites with distinct patterns related to transcription, chromatin architecture, and chemical oxidation potential.

The obtained NiFe@NBCNT hybrid exhibits a high electrochemical activity and stability with an unexpectedly low overpotential of  approximately 195 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) and an onset potential at 1.03 V for ORR, superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO(2) catalysts. Additionally, compared to the mixture of Pt/C and RuO(2) cathodes, the ZAB based on the NiFe@NBCNT cathode displays a lower overpotential (0.80 V), higher stable round-trip efficiency (58.3%), and improved power density for 200 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2).

        "abstract": "Tendon or ligament reconstructions often use autologous or allogenic tendons from either extrasynovial or intrasynovial sources. Allograft tendons must be lyophilized for preservation before transplantation, a process which can impact mechanical properties of the graft. Reconstituted graft properties that are similar to native tendon are desirable. Although tensile and compressive properties of tendons have been investigated, there is a paucity of information describing flexural properties of tendon, which can impact the gliding resistance. This study aims to design a testing method to quantify tendon flexural modulus, and investigate the effects of lyophilization/rehydration procedures on tendon flexibility. A total of 20 peroneus longus tendons (extrasynovial) and 20 flexor digitorum profundus tendons (intrasynovial) were collected. Ten of each tendon were processed with 5 freeze-thaw cycles followed by lyophilization and rehydration with saline solution (0.9%). Bend testing was conducted on tendons to quantify the flexural modulus with and without processing. As canine FDP tendons contain fibrous and fibrocartilaginous tissue regions, the flexural moduli were measured in both regions. Flexural modulus of rehydrated, lyophilized extrasynovial PL tendon was significantly lower than that of similarly processed intrasynovial FDP tendon (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Flexural moduli of both the fibrocartilaginous and non-fibrocartilaginous regions of intrasynovial tendon significantly increased after lyophilization (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The flexural modulus of the fibrocartilaginous region was significantly higher than that of the non-fibrocartilaginous region in intrasynovial tendon (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lyophilization significantly increases the flexural modulus of extrasynovial and intrasynovial tendons, and flexural modulus differs significantly between these two tendon types. Increases in stiffness caused by lyophilization may impact the mechanical performance of the allograft in vivo.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate nuclei detection and segmentation in histological images is essential for many clinical purposes. While manual annotations are time-consuming and operator-dependent, full automated segmentation remains a challenging task due to the high variability of cells intensity, size and morphology. Most of the proposed algorithms for the automated segmentation of nuclei were designed for specific organ or tissues. RESULTS: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a fully multiscale method, named MANA (Multiscale Adaptive Nuclei Analysis), for nuclei segmentation in different tissues and magnifications. MANA was tested on a dataset of H&E stained tissue images with more than 59,000 annotated nuclei, taken from six organs (colon, liver, bone, prostate, adrenal gland and thyroid) and three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). Automatic results were compared with manual segmentations and three open-source software designed for nuclei detection. For each organ, MANA obtained always an F1-score higher than 0.91, with an average F1 of 0.9305 +/- 0.0161. The average computational time was about 20 s independently of the number of nuclei to be detected (anyway, higher than 1000), indicating the efficiency of the proposed technique. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, MANA is the first fully automated multi-scale and multi-tissue algorithm for nuclei detection. Overall, the robustness and versatility of MANA allowed to achieve, on different organs and magnifications, performances in line or better than those of state-of-art algorithms optimized for single tissues.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease (DD) remains unclear although there is increasing evidence supporting the role of stem cells in this and other fibrotic conditions. This review examines the role of DD tissue-associated embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and circulating fibrocytes and circulating MSCs, in the biology of DD. It is exciting to infer that dysfunction of an upstream ESC-like population within the affected tissue leads to the downstream development and proliferation of aberrant myofibroblasts through a putative MSC intermediate. This ESC-like population may be a potential novel therapeutic target through modulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, circulating CD34(+) fibrocytes and MSCs either derived from the bone marrow, peripheral blood cells, or DD-associated ESC-like population, may serve as potential additional extra-palmar reservoirs that undergo endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, eventually giving rise to the aberrant myofibroblasts. Further studies examining the relative roles of these stem cells and the precise regulatory pathways that govern them may lead to novel therapy that targets these populations.",

In this paper, we propose a joint energy supply and routing path selection algorithm to extend the network lifetime based on an initiative power supply. We develop a two-stage energy replenishment strategy to supplement the energy consumption of nodes as much as possible. Furthermore, the influence of charging factors on the selection of next-hop nodes in data routing is considered. The simulation results show that our algorithm effectively prolong the network lifetime, and different demands of network delay and energy consumption can be obtained by dynamically adjusting parameters.",

We sought to characterize the responsiveness of class II (enhanced kinase activity, dimerization dependent) BRAF mutant melanoma to dMAPKi. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors from patients with BRAF wild-type (WT), V600E (class I), and L597S (class II) metastatic melanoma were used to generate patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines with class IIa (activation segment) or IIb (p-loop) mutations and compared these with WT or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with BRAFi (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and LY3009120), MEKi (cobimetinib, trametinib, and binimetinib), or the combination. We identified 2 patients with BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. RESULTS: BRAFi impaired MAPK signaling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations and prolonged survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. CONCLUSIONS: Class II BRAF mutant melanoma is growth inhibited by dMAPKi. Responses to dMAPKi have been observed in 2 patients with class II BRAF mutant melanoma. These data provide rationale for clinical investigation of dMAPKi in patients with class II BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.See related commentary by Johnson and Dahlman, p. 6107.",

        "abstract": "There are animal species that have adapted to life at high altitude and hypobaric hypoxia conditions in the Andean highlands. One such species is the llama (Lama glama), which seem to have developed efficient protective mechanisms to avoid maladaptation resulting from chronic hypoxia, such as a resistance to the development of hypoxia -induced pulmonary hypertension. On the other hand, it is widely known that different models of hypertension can arise as a result of changes in endothelial function. The respect, one of the common causes of deregulation in endothelial vasodilator function have been associated with down-regulation of the NO synthesis and an increase in plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and homocysteine. Additionally, it is also known that NO production can be regulated by plasma levels of L-arginine as a result of the competition between nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase. The objective of this study, was to determine the baseline concentrations of ADMA and homocysteine in llama, and to evaluate their effect on the arginase pathway and their involvement in the resistance to the development of altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension. METHOD: Lowland and highland newborn sheep and llama were investigated near sea level and at high altitude. Blood determinations of arterial blood gases, ADMA and homocysteine are made and the effect of these on the arginase activity was evaluated. RESULTS: The basal concentrations of ADMA and homocysteine were determined in llama, and they were found to be significantly lower than those found in other species and in addition, the exposure to hypoxia is unable to increase its concentration. On the other hand, it was observed that the llama exhibited 10 times less arginase II activity as compared to sheep, and the expression was not induced by hypoxia. Finally, ADMA y Hcy, has no effect on the type II arginase pathway. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we propose that low concentrations of ADMA and homocysteine found in llamas, the low expression of arginase type II, DDAH-2 and CBS, as well as its insensitivity to activation by homocysteine could constitute an adaptation mechanism of these animals to the hypoxia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Second European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey recently demonstrated widespread discrimination across EU countries, with high discrimination rates observed in countries like Finland. Discrimination is known to negatively impact health, but fewer studies have examined how different types of perceived discrimination are related to health. METHODS: This study examines (i) the prevalence of different types of perceived discrimination among Russian, Somali and Kurdish origin populations in Finland, and (ii) the association between different types of perceived discrimination (no experiences; subtle discrimination only; overt or subtle and overt discrimination) and health (self-rated health; limiting long-term illness (LLTI) or disability; mental health symptoms). Data are from the Finnish Migrant Health and Wellbeing Study (n = 1795). Subtle discrimination implies reporting being treated with less courtesy and/or treated with less respect than others, and overt discrimination being called names or insulted and/or threatened or harassed. The prevalence of discrimination and the associations between discrimination and health were calculated with predicted margins and logistic regression. RESULTS: Experiences of subtle discrimination were more common than overt discrimination in all the studied groups. Subtle discrimination was reported by 29% of Somali origin persons and 35% Russian and Kurdish origin persons. The prevalence of overt discrimination ranged between 22% and 24%. Experiences of discrimination increased the odds for poor self-reported health, LLTI and mental health symptoms, particularly among those reporting subtle discrimination only. CONCLUSIONS: To promote the health of diverse populations, actions against racism and discrimination are highly needed, including initiatives that promote shared belonging.",

        "abstract": "Eye formation in vertebrates involves highly coordinated processes, and the differentiation of various eye tissues is regulated by conserved transcription factors and signalling pathways. Mutations in key genes of the regulatory hierarchy lead to congenital disorders and ocular diseases. The Wnt signalling pathway plays a key role in different aspects of eye development, and several Wnt receptors of the Frizzled family are required for eye specification and differentiation. However, their precise function in these processes remains elusive. Here we show that mutation of the frizzled8a gene in zebrafish leads to microphthalmia. The differentiation of retinal layers is delayed, and retinal progenitor cells in microphthalmic embryos fail to normally exit the cell cycle to enter into the post-mitotic state. They exhibit delayed differentiation associated with enhanced apoptosis, which results in abnormal lamination of retinal layers, reduction in the number of retinal cells, and small eye phenotype. These findings suggest that Frizzled8a plays a specific role in regulating cell cycle progression during the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells.",

However, the poor workability at room temperature restricts the processing of high-precision micro-tubes for the application as stent materials. In this study, Mg-Zn-Y-Nd alloy tube blank was firstly produced through hot extrusion. By multi-pass cold drawing combining with interpass annealing, the extruded tube blank can be processed into high-precision micro-tube with an outer diameter of about 2.0\u202fmm and a wall thickness of about 0.15\u202fmm. The drawn micro-tube after annealing exhibits improved mechanical properties with an ultimate tensile strength of about 298\u202fMPa and a large breaking elongation of up to 20%. Meanwhile, the micro-tube shows good corrosion resistance with a trend of uniform corrosion in simulated body fluid solution. The investigation revealed that a significant improvement in the mechanical properties is mainly attributed to grain refinement and texture weaken, while the good biodegradable properties is related with the low density of crystallographic defects as well as fine and homogeneous microstructure. As a result, the successful processing of magnesium alloy micro-tube provides the precursor for laser engraving stents.",

However, because convergent evolution may arise via alternative evolutionary mechanisms, putative examples of Batesian mimicry must be rigorously tested. Here, we used artificial butterfly facsimiles (N = 4000) to test the prediction that (1) palatable Limenitis lorquini butterflies should experience reduced predation when in sympatry with their putative model, Adelpha californica, (2) protection from predation on L. lorquini should erode outside of the geographical range of the model, and (3) mimetic color pattern traits are more variable in allopatry, consistent with relaxed selection for mimicry. We find support for these predictions, implying that this convergence is the result of selection for Batesian mimicry. Additionally, we conducted mark-recapture studies to examine the effect of mimicry and found that mimics survive significantly longer at sites where the model is abundant. Finally, in contrast to theoretical predictions, we found evidence that the Batesian model (A. californica) is protected from predation outside of its geographic range. We discuss these results considering the ongoing hybridization between L. lorquini and its sister species, L. weidemeyerii, and growing evidence that selection for mimicry predictably leads to a reduction in gene flow between nascent species.",

This study was focused on the relation with antibiotics and enterocins of identified Aeromonas species isolated from the intestine of trouts living in Slovakian aquatic sources. Intestinal samples from 50 trouts (3 Salmo trutta and 47 Salmo gairdnerii) were collected in April of years 2007, 2010, and 2015 from trouts of different water sources in Slovakia (pond Bukovec near Kosice, river Cierny Vah). Due to the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry evaluation, 25 strains were proposed to the genus Aeromonas involving nine different species (Aeromonas bestiarum-nine strains, Aer. salmonicida-four strains, Aer. encheleia, Aer. eucrenophila, Aer. molluscorum, Aer. media, Aer. sobria, Aer. popoffii, Aer. veronii). Phenotypic evaluation of individual strains confirmed their species identification. Twenty-five strains of different Aeromonas species were sensitive to azithromycin, amikacin, mecillinam, mezlocillin, piperacillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. On the other side, they were resistant to carbenicillin and ticarcillin. The growth of Aer. bestiarum R41/1 was inhibited by treatment with Ent M and Ent 2019 (inhibition activity 100 AU/mL). Aer. bestiarum R47/3 was inhibited by eight enterocins (100 AU/mL). It is the first study testing enterocins to inhibit the growth of Aeromonas species from trouts.",

        "abstract": "Metasurfaces are two dimensional arrays of artificial subwavelength resonators, which can manipulate the amplitude and phase profile of incident electromagnetic fields. To date, limited progress has been achieved in realizing reconfigurable phase control of incident waves using metasurfaces. Here, an active metasurface is presented, whose resonance frequency can be tuned by employing insulator to metal transition in vanadium dioxide. By virtue of the phase jump accompanied by the resonance frequency tuning, the proposed metasurface acts as a phase shifter at THz frequency. It is further demonstrated that by appropriately tailoring the anisotropy of the metasurface, the observed phase shift can be used to switch the transmitted polarization from circular to approximately linear. This work thus shows potential for reconfigurable phase and polarization control at THz frequencies using vanadium dioxide based frequency tunable metasurfaces.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify rates of overweight (body mass index [BMI] >/=85th percentile) and obesity (BMI >/=95th percentile) at 6-7 years of age and associated risk factors among extremely preterm infants born at <28 weeks of gestation. STUDY DESIGN: Anthropometrics, blood pressure, and active and sedentary activity levels were prospectively assessed. Three groups were compared, those with a BMI >/=85th percentile (overweight or obese for age, height, and sex) and >/=95th percentile (obese) vs <85th percentile. Multiple regression analyses estimated the relative risks of BMI >/=85th percentile and >/=95th percentile associated with perinatal and early childhood factors. RESULTS: Of 388 children, 22% had a BMI of >/=85th percentile and 10% were obese. Children with obesity and overweight compared with normal weight children had higher body fat (subscapular skinfold and triceps skinfold >85th percentile), central fat (waist circumference >90th percentile), spent more time in sedentary activity (20.5 vs 18.2 vs 16.7 hours/week), and had either systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (24% vs 26% vs 14%), respectively. Postdischarge weight gain velocities from 36 weeks postmenstrual age to 18 months, and 18 months to 6-7 years were independently associated with a BMI of >/=85th percentile, whereas weight gain velocity from 18 months to 6-7 years was associated with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: One in 5 former extremely preterm infants is overweight or obese and has central obesity at early school age. Postdischarge weight gain velocities were associated with overweight and obesity. These findings suggest the obesity epidemic is spreading to the most extremely preterm infants.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antitumor activity and bone-targeting ability of CUR-loaded ALN-oHA-S-S-CUR micelles. The in vivo experiment results showed that a larger number of micelles was gathered in the bone metastatic tumor tissue and reduced the bone destruction.

CKD profoundly affects HDL composition and functionality, but whether abnormal HDL independently contributes to cardiovascular events in CKD patients remains elusive. In the present study, we assessed whether compositional and functional properties of HDL predict cardiovascular outcome among 526 nondialysis CKD patients who participate in the CARE FOR HOMe study. We measured HDL cholesterol, the content of HDL-associated proinflammatory serum amyloid A (SAA), and activities of the HDL enzymes paraoxonase and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA(2)). In addition, we assessed the antioxidative activity of apoB-depleted serum. During a mean follow-up of 5.1 +/- 2.1 years, 153 patients reached the predefined primary endpoint, a composite of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events including cardiovascular mortality and death of any cause. In univariate Cox regression analyses, lower HDL-cholesterol levels, higher HDL-associated SAA content, and lower paraoxonase activity predicted cardiovascular outcome, while Lp-PLA(2) activity and antioxidative capacity did not. HDL-cholesterol and HDL-paraoxonase activity lost their association with cardiovascular outcome after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular and renal risk factors, while SAA lost its association after further adjustment for C-reactive protein. In conclusion, our data suggest that neither HDL quantity nor HDL composition or function independently predict cardiovascular outcome among nondialysis CKD patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) commonly arises secondary to conditions affecting the left heart and is associated with right ventricular dysfunction and tricuspid annular dilatation. We set out to establish an animal model of acute RV failure (RVF) with FTR resembling the clinical features. METHODS: Ten adult sheep had pressure sensors placed in the LV, RV, and right atrium while sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around tricuspid annulus and on the RV. Animals were studied open-chest to assess for RV function and FTR after: (1) volume infusion, (2) pulmonary artery constriction, (3) 5\u202fmin posterior descending artery occlusion, and (4) combination of all interventions. Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and sonomicrometry data were collected at baseline and after every intervention. RV dimensions, RV strain, and annular area, perimeter, and size were calculated from crystal coordinates. The model was validated in six additional sheep studied only before and after combined interventions. RESULTS: Neither volume infusion, pulmonary hypertension, nor ischemia were associated with RVF or clinically significant TR when applied separately but combined resulted in RVF and greater than moderate FTR. In the validation group, maximal RV volume increased (62\u202f+/-\u202f14 vs 70\u202f+/-\u202f16\u202fml, p\u202f=\u202f0.006), contractility decreased (20\u202f+/-\u202f6 vs 12\u202f+/-\u202f2%, p\u202f=\u202f0.02), and strain increased. FTR increased from 0.4\u202f+/-\u202f0.5 to 2.5\u202f+/-\u202f0.8 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and annular area from 652\u202f+/-\u202f87\u202fmm(2) to 739\u202f+/-\u202f87\u202fmm(2) (p\u202f=\u202f0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The developed ovine model of acute RVF was associated with significant annular and RV enlargement and FTR. This novel and clinically pertinent research platform offers insight into the acute RVF pathophysiology and can be utilized to evaluate treatment interventions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of methylprednisolone on the proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells (ENSCs) in nonhuman primates with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS A total of 14 healthy cynomolgus monkeys ( Macaca fascicularis) (4-5 years of age) were randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group (n = 6), SCI group (n = 6), and methylprednisolone therapy group (n = 2). Only laminectomy was performed in the control animals at T-10. SCI was induced in monkeys using Allen's weight-drop method (50 mm x 50 g) to injure the posterior portion of the spinal cord at T-10. In the methylprednisolone therapy group, monkeys were intravenously infused with methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) immediately after SCI. All animals were intravenously infused with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (50 mg/kg/day) for 3 days prior to study end point. The small intestine was dissected for immunohistochemical examination. After 3, 7, and 14 days, the spinal cord segments of the control and SCI groups were dissected to prepare frozen and paraffin sections. The proliferation of ENSCs was evaluated using BrdU and nestin immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS Histological examination showed that a larger number of mucosa epithelial cells in the small intestine of all groups were BrdU positive. Nestin-positive ependymal cells are increased around the central canal after SCI. After 3, 7, and 14 days of SCI, BrdU-positive ependymal cells in the SCI group were significantly increased compared with the control group, and the percentage of BrdU-positive cells in the left/right ventral horns and dorsal horn was significantly higher than that of the control group. Seven days after SCI, the percentages of both BrdU-positive ependymal cells around the central canal and BrdU- and nestin-double positive cells in the left/right ventral horns and dorsal horn were significantly lower in the methylprednisolone therapy group than in the SCI group. CONCLUSIONS While ENSCs proliferate significantly after SCI in nonhuman primates, methylprednisolone can inhibit the proliferation of ependymal cells after SCI.",

The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), a synthetic food additive, in serving as an antioxidant against sub-lethal diazinon-induced oxidative stress in male Wistar rats. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups: Control (treated with corn oil as a vehicle), diazinon (10 mg/kg/day), TBHQ (0.028 g/kg of diet) and a combination group of TBHQ (0.028 g/kg of diet) plus diazinon (10 mg/kg/day). All animals were treated orally once a day by gastric tube and treatments were continued for 7 weeks. Hematological indices, including red blood cell (RBC) indices and white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, were measured at the end of the treatment schedule. On comparison of the treatment groups with the untreated control group, RBC count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly decreased in the diazinon and TBHQ+diazinon groups, while MCHC in the TBHQ group and MCV in the diazinon and TBHQ+diazinon groups were significantly increased. When the diazinon and TBHQ+diazinon groups were compared with the TBHQ group, RBC, Hb, Hct, and MCHC were significantly decreased whereas MCV was increased in both groups. Additionally, when comparing the TBHQ+diazinon group with the diazinon group, MCHC was determined to be significantly decreased. The results of the current experiments suggested that TBHQ could not efficiently protect blood cells against diazinon toxicity.",

We have investigated the ability of IV in-line filters to eliminate particulate matter from multidrug infusion lines and so prevent contamination. The impact on particle occurrence of the internal volume of the IV line below the in-line filter was then evaluated. The multidrug therapy given to children was reproduced with and without in-line filtration. Three combinations with a filter were tested to vary the internal volume (V) between the filter and the catheter egress. The catheter was then connected to a dynamic particle count to evaluate the particulate matter potentially administered to children during infusion. The introduction of in-line filters led to a significant reduction in overall particulate matter, from 416,974 [208,479-880,229] to 7,551 [1,985-11,287] particles (p < 0.001). Larger particles of >/=10 and 25 microm were also significantly reduced. Adding an extension set to the egress of the in-line filter (V = 1.7 mL) caused a significant increase in particulate contamination for both. This study showed that in-line filtration is an effective tool in preventing particle administration to patients. Their position in the infusion in-line is therefore important because of its impact on internal volume and drug particle formation.",

        "abstract": "Recent epidemiological findings suggest that high levels of dietary acid load can affect insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Consumption of high protein diets results in the over-production of metabolic acids which has been associated with the development of chronic metabolic disturbances. Mild metabolic acidosis has been shown to impair peripheral insulin action and several epidemiological findings suggest that metabolic acid load markers are associated with insulin resistance and impaired glycemic control through an interference intracellular insulin signaling pathways and translocation. In addition, higher incidence of diabetes, insulin resistance, or impaired glucose control have been found in subjects with elevated metabolic acid load markers. Hence, lowering dietary acid load may be relevant for improving glucose homeostasis and prevention of type 2 diabetes development on a long-term basis. However, limitations related to patient acid load estimation, nutritional determinants, and metabolic status considerably flaws available findings, and the lack of solid data on the background physiopathology contributes to the questionability of results. Furthermore, evidence from interventional studies is very limited and the trials carried out report no beneficial results following alkali supplementation. Available literature suggests that poor acid load control may contribute to impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, but it is not sufficiently supportive to fully elucidate the issue and additional well-designed studies are clearly needed.",

        "abstract": "The FMN-heme interdomain electron transfer (IET) in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is a key stage of the electron transport chain, which supplies the catalytic heme site(s) with the NADPH-derived electrons. While there is a recognition that this IET depends on both the electron tunneling and the conformational dynamics, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this work, the IET kinetics were measured by laser flash photolysis for a bidomain oxygenase/FMN (oxyFMN) construct of human inducible NOS (iNOS) over the ionic strength range from 0.1 to 0.5\u202fM. The forward (heme\u202f-->\u202fFMN, k(ETf)) and backward (FMN\u202f-->\u202fheme, k(ETb)) intrinsic IET rate constants were determined from the analysis of the observed IET rates using the additional information regarding the conformational dynamics obtained from the FMN fluorescence lifetime measurements and theoretical estimates. Both k(ETf) and k(ETb) exhibit a bell-shaped dependence on the ionic strength, I, with the maximum rates corresponding to I\u202f~\u202f0.2\u202fM. This dependence was explained using a new model, which considers the effect of formation of pairs between the protein surface charged residues and solution ions on the docked state dynamics. The trial simulations of the intrinsic IET rate dependences using this model show that the data can be reproduced using reasonable energetic, structural, and chemical parameters.

        "abstract": "Objective: To explore a simple method for early detection of osteoporosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), by analyzing the correlation between computed tomography (CT) values of the thoracolumbar vertebrae and dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA). Methods: 86 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD were included in this study. The average age of the patients, including 57 males and 29 females, was 74+/-10 years. They all received chest CT and DXA examination within 1 month after admission. The relation between each CT value from 6(th) thoracic vertebrae (T6) to 1(st) lumbar (L1) and T-score measured by DXA was analyzed by linear correlation analysis with SPSS 17.0 software. Results: The mean CT value of T6-L1 was significantly lower in patients with osteoporosis than that in patients with normal bone mineral density (P<0.05). The CT values of T6-L1 were positively correlated with T-score (P<0.001). The ROC curve analysis of T6-L1 CT value showed that the area under ROC curve of L1 CT value was the largest, and therefore the accuracy of diagnosis of osteoporosis by L1 CT value was better.A L1 CT value lower than 100 HU was proposed as the threshold for lower bone mass or osteoporosis in the patients. Conclusion: It is possible to detect osteoporosis in patients with COPD through evaluating the CT values of T6-L1. This method could potentially reduce X-ray irradiation and expense. Early detection and intervention in patients with COPD and osteoporosis could improve the prognosis of patients.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to determine the percentage of infertility patients who are diagnosed with a non-receptive endometrium according to the endometrial receptivity array (ERA) test and to examine whether adjusting the embryo transfer day according to the proposed shift in the window of implantation improves the pregnancy rate compared to non-ERA-tested patients. METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study, including 53 consecutive good prognosis patients (0-2 previous frozen embryo transfers) admitted to our IVF unit for a mock cycle prior to their frozen day-5 embryo (blastocyst) transfer cycle. The mock cycle included an endometrial biopsy for both the ERA test and histological assessment by the Noyes criteria (study group). The next cycle frozen embryo transfer (FET) in the study group was adjusted according to the ERA results. The control group consisted of patients who underwent FET cycles at our clinic during the same period, without performing the endometrial biopsy and ERA testing. RESULTS: During the study period, 503 patients (control group) underwent FET cycles without performing the ERA testing and 41 patients had FET following an ERA test. There were no between-group differences in patients' age, number of previous transfers, endometrial thickness, number of transferred embryos, and ongoing pregnancy rates (35.2 vs. 39%, respectively, p = NS). Out of the 53 patients who performed the ERA test before their first or second FET, five endometrial samples (9.4%) were found to be post-receptive, 29 (54.7%) pre-receptive, and only 19 samples (35.8%) were receptive. Women in the study group with pre- or post-receptive endometrium on ERA testing, the appropriate adjustment in timing of FET according to the ERA test resulted in a 33.3% pregnancy rate, which is comparable to the 35.2% background ongoing pregnancy rate of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Performing the ERA test in a mock cycle prior to a FET does not seem to improve the ongoing pregnancy rate in good prognosis patients. Further large prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of ERA testing in both good prognosis patients and in patients with recurrent implantation failure.",

        "abstract": "The study introduces an analytical platform for the detection of genes or aptamer-ligand complexes by nucleic acid barcode patterns generated by DNA machineries. The DNA machineries consist of nucleic acid scaffolds that include specific recognition sites for the different genes or aptamer-ligand analytes. The binding of the analytes to the scaffolds initiate, in the presence of the nucleotide mixture, a cyclic polymerization/nicking machinery that yields displaced strands of variable lengths. The electrophoretic separation of the resulting strands provides barcode patterns for the specific detection of the different analytes. Mixtures of DNA machineries that yield, upon sensing of different genes (or aptamer ligands), one-, two-, or three-band barcode patterns are described. The combination of nucleic acid scaffolds acting, in the presence of polymerase/nicking enzyme and nucleotide mixture, as DNA machineries, that generate multiband barcode patterns provide an analytical platform for the detection of an individual gene out of many possible genes. The diversity of genes (or other analytes) that can be analyzed by the DNA machineries and the barcode patterned imaging is given by the Pascal's triangle. As a proof-of-concept, the detection of one of six genes, that is, TP53, Werner syndrome, Tay-Sachs normal gene, BRCA1, Tay-Sachs mutant gene, and cystic fibrosis disorder gene by six two-band barcode patterns is demonstrated. The advantages and limitations of the detection of analytes by polymerase/nicking DNA machineries that yield barcode patterns as imaging readout signals are discussed.",

The role of the stress\u202fx\u202fBDNF Val66Met interaction in depression has been studied widely using childhood stress, but few studies have utilized chronic stress in adulthood as a moderator. This study was to examine the chronic stress\u202fx\u202fBDNF Val66Met interaction in job-related depression in the healthcare workers in a Chinese Han population, which has not been reported yet. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 243 doctors and nurses were recruited from a general hospital in Beijing, and were assessed for depression with Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the stress using the House and Rizzo's Work Stress Scale. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped. RESULTS: There was a significant positive association between job stress and depressive scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). No significant main effect of the BDNF Val66Met genotype on depressive symptoms was observed (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). A statistically significant interaction between BDNF Val66Met and job stress on depressive symptoms was found (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); individuals with Val/Val genotype showed a higher SDS score than Met allele carriers only in the low-stress group, without significant differences in SDS score between the BDNF Val66Met subgroups in medium- or high-stress group. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include cross-sectional study design, the small sample size only in healthcare workers and only one polymorphism in BDNF gene was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a close relationship between job-related stress and depression, and the interaction of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and chronic stress in adulthood may impact the depressive symptoms.",

Data were collected for operative characteristics, surgical complications and pain related outcomes. Overall, operative times for OIHR were less than RIHR (83.7 vs. 109.7 min, p < 0.0001); however, there was no difference in operative time for bilateral repairs (121.5 vs. 121.9 min, p = ns). Complication rates were similar between the groups. RIHR patients had less pain at POD 1 than OIHR patients (p = 0.05). RIHR were less likely to have multiple post-op visits for pain than OIHR patients (p = 0.003). RIHR can be implemented in the VA system with acceptable surgical outcomes. RIHR may be associated with less post-operative pain in the early post-operative period.",

METHODS: The sFasL and sTRAIL levels in the sera of patients with bladder cancer or healthy donors were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Micro-culture tetrazolium viability assay and Western blot were used to analyze cell cytotoxicity and death receptors protein expression respectively. RESULTS: Whether no difference in sTRAIL levels was seen between patients and controls, the level of sFasL was higher in patients than that in healthy donors. According to, sFasL level was the highest in the serum of patients with superficial stage or low- and medium-grade cancer. Moreover, sFasL in patients with superficial noninvasive bladder tumors or low- and medium-grade cancers was higher than that in patients with invasive carcinomas and high-grade cancers. Patients with high levels of sFasL survive longer than those with low levels, probably related to the cytotoxic potential of FasL preserved in its soluble form. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that monitoring the level of sFasL and its cytotoxic activity could be a prognostic marker in the follow-up of patients with bladder cancer.",

This study aimed to investigate if cesarean section increases the risk of IC/PBS. METHODS: Women who exclusively gave birth through cesarean section or vaginal delivery were identified from a nationwide database between 2002 and 2013. All were followed up during the study period to detect the event of IC/PBS. The IC/PBS hazard ratio (HR) in the cesarean cohort was compared with the vaginal delivery cohort with and without matching for confounding factors. RESULTS: The unmatched group included 22 158 cesarean deliveries and 40 214 vaginal deliveries. The IC/PBS HR in the cesarean cohort compared with that in the vaginal delivery cohort was 1.370 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.903-2.079; P = 0.139). In the matched group, 8368 women were matched in each cesarean and vaginal delivery cohort using propensity scores for age and comorbidities. The IC/PBS HR was 0.725 (95%CI, 0.358-1.471; P = 0.373). Both HRs in these two groups were not significantly different. The incidence density of IC/PBS in delivered women, non-delivery women, and the general female population were not significantly different either (0.310, 0.255, and 0.292 per 1000 person-years, respectively; P = 0.549). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of IC/PBS was not different between cesarean and vaginal delivery after controlling the confounding factors in this cohort study. Cesarean section has no causal effect on IC/BPS. Furthermore, delivery was not a risk factor for IC/PBS.",

The RapidChek method uses a proprietary enrichment media system, a 44-48 h enrichment at 30 +/- 1 degrees C, and detects L. monocytogenes on an immunochromatographic lateral flow device within 10 min. Different L. monocytogenes strains were used to spike each of the matrixes. Samples were confirmed based on the reference method confirmations and an alternate confirmation method. A total of 140 low-level spiked samples were tested by the RapidChek method after enrichment for 44-48 h in parallel with the cultural reference method. There were 88 RapidChek presumptive positives. One of the presumptive positives was not confirmed culturally. Additionally, one of the culturally confirmed samples did not exhibit a presumptive positive. No difference between the alternate confirmation method and reference confirmation method was observed. The respective cultural reference methods (USDA-FSIS/MLG, FDA/BAM, and AOAC/OMA) produced a total of 63 confirmed positive results. Nonspiked samples from all foods were reported as negative for L. monocytogenes by all methods. Probability of detection analysis demonstrated no significant differences in the number of positive samples detected by the RapidChek method and the respective cultural reference method.",

Such systems generate a single-handed chiral near field with simultaneous zero far-field circular dichroism. The phenomenon is theoretically elucidated with a rotating dipole model, which predicts a uniform single-handed chiral near field that flips handedness solely by reversing the handedness of the source. This property allows detection of pure background free molecular chirality through near-field light-matter interaction, which is experimentally demonstrated in the precise identification of both handedness of a chiral molecule on a single substrate with about four orders of magnitude enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to its conventional volumetric counterpart.",

(K.) medvedevi inter alia by its smaller eyes, sparser pubescence of the pronotum and elytra, shorter 3rd antennal joint and more elongate, acute lobes of the protarsomere 3. Moreover, there are distinct differences in the morphology of the male genitalia in both cases.

Secondary objectives were to examine associations between treatment adherence, QOL, treatment satisfaction, and illness perception. METHODS: This cross-sectional study, conducted in 20 community pharmacies from all districts of Lebanon between August 2016 and April 2017, enrolled 247 adult patients taking any statin. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 52.63 +/- 11.92 years (57.5% males); the mean duration of treatment with a statin was 59.72 months. A significant association was found between adherence and marital status ( P < .0001), educational level ( P = .001), cigarette smoking ( P < .0001), and alcohol drinking ( P < .0001). A negative but significant correlation was found between the adherence score and the duration of dyslipidemia ( r = -0.199). A significant but negative correlation was also found between the side effect score and age ( r = -0.137). The monthly salary, the marital status, the educational level, smoking cigarettes or waterpipes, and drinking alcohol were all associated with the Illness Perception Questionnaire scores ( P < 0.0001 for all variables). Secondary level of education (beta = 13.43), smoking more than 3 waterpipes per week (beta = 14.06), global satisfaction score (beta = 0.32), convenience score (beta = 0.29), and effectiveness score (beta = 0.27) would significantly increase the adherence score. Smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day (beta = -11.15) and a divorced status (beta = -14.81) would however significantly decrease the adherence score. Significant associations were found between the illness perception score, the QOL domains, and the satisfaction domains ( P < .05 for all variables). CONCLUSION: This study showed that global satisfaction with treatment, convenience, and effectiveness are important factors that increase treatment adherence. Patient adherence results in patient satisfaction and improved QOL and is an important criterion for achieving desired therapeutic outcomes.",

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario 'A. Gemelli', Rome, Italy. PATIENTS: A total of 12 098 deliveries in periods I (1998-1999) and II (2010-2011). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CS rates in groups 1 and 3 of RTGCS. RESULTS: In group 1, 1144 (20%) patients were assigned to period I and 1302 (20.4%) to period II, while in group 3, 1587 (27.8%) were assigned to period I and 1502 (23.5%) to period II. CS rates were 16.4% and 23.1% in group 1 and 12.7% and 10.9% in group 3 in periods I and II, respectively. In group 1, significant and independent contributions to CS rate were provided by maternal age (p=0.018; OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.97)), body mass index (BMI) (p=0.022; OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.91)) and EA administration (p=0.037; OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.77)). In group 3, maternal age (p<0.001; OR 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.96)) and BMI (p=0.023; OR 0.98 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.99)) were found to be significantly associated with CS. CONCLUSIONS: RTGCS is an effective tool for analysing changes in obstetric care, allowing for the recognition of maternal age, BMI and EA administration in the strategic planning for mitigation of CS rates in selected groups.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Despite global efforts to increase facility-based delivery (FBD), 90% of women in rural Ethiopia deliver at home without a skilled birth attendant. Men have an important role in increasing FBD due to their decision-making power, but this is largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine the FBD care attributes preferred by women and men, and whether poverty or household decision-making are associated with choice to deliver in a facility. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional discrete choice experiment in 109 randomly selected households in rural Ethiopia in September-October 2015. We interviewed women who were pregnant or who had a child <2 years old and their male partners. RESULTS: Both women and men preferred health facilities where medications and supplies were available (OR=3.08; 95% CI 2.03 to 4.67 and OR=2.68; 95% CI 1.79 to 4.02, respectively), a support person was allowed in the delivery room (OR=1.69; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.07 and OR=1.74; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.14, respectively) and delivery cost was low (OR=1.15 95% CI 1.12 to 1.18 and OR=1.14; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.17, respectively). Women valued free ambulance service (OR=1.37; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.70), while men favoured nearby facilities (OR=1.09; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.13) with friendly providers (OR=1.30; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.64). Provider preferences were complex. Neither women nor men preferred female doctors to health extension workers (HEW) (OR=0.92; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.42 and OR=0.74; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.14, respectively), male doctors to HEW (OR=1.33; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.99 and OR=0.75; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12, respectively) or female over male nurses (OR=0.68; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.71 and OR=1.03; 95% CI 0.77 to 2.94, respectively). While both women and men preferred male nurses to HEW (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80 and OR=1.95; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.95, respectively), men (OR=1.89; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.78), but not women (OR=1.47; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.13) preferred HEW to female nurses. Both women and men preferred female doctors to male nurses (OR=1.71; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.29 and OR=1.44; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.92, respectively), male doctors to female nurses (OR=1.95; 95% CI 1.44 to 2.62 and OR=1.41; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.90, respectively) and male doctors to male nurses (OR=2.47; 95% CI 1.84 to 3.32 and OR=1.46; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.95, respectively), while only women preferred male doctors to female doctors (OR=1.45; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.93 and OR=1.01; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35, respectively) and only men preferred female nurses to female doctors (OR=1.34; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84 and OR=1.39; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.89, respectively). Men were disproportionately involved in making household decisions (X(2) (1, n=216)=72.18, p<0.001), including decisions to seek healthcare (X(2) (1, n=216)=55.39, p<0.001), yet men were often unaware of their partners' prenatal care attendance (X(2) (1, n=215)=82.59, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Women's and men's preferences may influence delivery service choices. Considering these choices is one way the Ethiopian government and health facilities may encourage FBD in rural areas.",

        "abstract": "The lifecycle of Leishmania, the causative agent of leishmaniasis, alternates between promastigote and amastigote stages inside the insect and vertebrate hosts, respectively. While pathogenic symptoms of leishmaniasis can vary widely, from benign cutaneous lesions to highly fatal visceral disease forms depending on the infective species, all Leishmania species reside inside host macrophages during the vertebrate stage of their lifecycle. Leishmania infectivity is therefore directly related to its ability to invade, survive and replicate within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) inside macrophages. Thus, assessing the parasite's ability to replicate intracellularly serves as a dependable method for determining virulence. Studying leishmaniasis development using animal models is time-consuming, tedious and often difficult, particularly with the pathogenically important visceral forms. We describe here a methodology to follow the intracellular development of Leishmania in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). Intracellular parasite numbers are determined at 24 h intervals for 72 - 96 h following infection. This method allows for a reliable determination of the effects of various genetic factors on Leishmania virulence. As an example, we show how a single allele deletion of the Leishmania Mitochondrial Iron Transporter gene (LMIT1) impairs the ability of the Leishmania amazonensis mutant strain LMIT1/DeltaLmit1 to grow inside BMMs, reflecting a drastic reduction in virulence compared to wild-type. This assay also allows precise control of experimental conditions, which can be individually manipulated to analyze the influence of various factors (nutrients, reactive oxygen species, etc.) on the host-pathogen interaction. Therefore, the appropriate execution and quantification of BMM infection studies provide a non-invasive, rapid, economical, safe and reliable alternative to conventional animal model studies.",

The analysis of measured data revealed the core research institutions, excellent research teams, leading scholars, major research aspects and research progress in the field. Results showed that most of the scholars in the field were from colleges and institutions, accounting for 74.6% of the total research findings and forming a group of core scholars. In terms of frequency and timeliness of citation, pharmacognosy is a discipline in sustained growth and development since it mainly cites the literature in the other disciplines, absorbs and utilizes knowledge of the other disciplines. Over the last few years, molecular identification and genetic diversity have become the research hotspots in pharmacognosy, and the techniques and methods such as ISSR, RAPD, DNA barcoding and DNA molecular marker have been widely used.",

RECENT FINDINGS: MSCs have multilineage potential and a low immunogenic profile and are immunomodulatory and more easy to expand in culture. Their ability to migrate, engraft and differentiate, or act via a paracrine effect on target tissues makes MSCs candidates for clinical therapies. Fetal and extra-fetal MSCs offer higher therapeutic potential compared to MSCs derived from adult sources. SUMMARY: MSCs may be safely transplanted prenatally via ultrasound-guided injection into the umbilical cord. Due to these characteristics, fetal MSCs are of great interest in the field of in utero stem cell transplantation for treatment of congenital disease.",

        "abstract": "Congenital heart defects represent a characteristic part of several genetic syndromes associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; many genes located in this locus, mainly TBX1, are candidate genes for congenital heart defects. In our cohort of 27 subjects with congenital heart defect, both karyotype analysis and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed. The TBX1 gene was sequenced in patients lacking chromosomal abnormalities. FISH analysis showed a de novo 22q11.2 deletion in two patients. The screening of TBX1 coding sequence identified a novel missense mutation c.569C\u202f>\u202fA (p.P190Q) in six unrelated patients and detected two associated known single nucleotide polymorphisms; the c.664C\u202f>\u202fT (rs2301558) in three patients and the c.420T\u202f>\u202fC (p.Phe140 Phe) (rs41298814) in one patient. Bioinformatic tools show that the novel missense mutation c.569C\u202f>\u202fA could modify the function and the stability of the TBX1 protein. The c.569C\u202f>\u202fA mutation was not found in 50 healthy controls. Ours results suggest a deleterious role of the c.569C\u202f>\u202fA mutation and strengthen the hypothesis that this mutation might be responsible for the same phenotype spectrum as the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.",

On the basis of massive sequencing data, functional interactions among different genes are suggested to explain the common molecular pathway underlying the pathogenic process of these disorders. However, the relevance of such interactions with the phenotypic severity or variety in an affected individual remains elusive. In this report, we present a 45-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy, and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified de novo pathogenic mutations in NF1 and the Schaaf-Yang syndrome-associated gene, MAGEL2. Literature-curated interaction data predicted that NF1 and MAGEL2 proteins were closely connected in this network via their common interacting proteins. Direct conversion of fibroblasts into neurons in vitro showed that neuronal cells from 9 patients with NF1 expressed significantly lower levels of MAGEL2 (54%, p = 0.0047) than those from healthy individuals. These data provide the first evidence that pathogenic mutations of NF1 deregulate the expression of other neurodevelopmental disease-associated genes. De novo mutations in multiple genes may lead to severe developmental phenotypes through their cumulative effects or synergistic interactions.",

However, as a result of procedural evolution over time, direct TAVI (without pre-implantation balloon aortic valvuloplasty) has emerged as an interesting option to simplify the procedure and to avoid potential valvuloplasty-related complications. Several real-world retrospective studies and one small randomised study have shown that direct TAVI (with both self-expanding and balloon-expandable prostheses) is feasible, safe and associated with outcomes similar to standard TAVI with pre-implantation balloon aortic valvuloplasty. In the absence of high-quality, robust evidence, the current review aims to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of omitting predilatation prior to TAVI.",

        "abstract": "As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, the manufacturer of reslizumab (Teva) submitted evidence for its clinical and cost effectiveness for the treatment of eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. NICE commissioned Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC) as an independent Evidence Review Group (ERG) to provide a critique of the manufacturer's submitted evidence. Reslizumab is compared with best standard of care and omalizumab, for a small 'overlap' population of patients who have both eosinophilic and IgE-mediated severe asthma. This paper provides a summary of the ERG's review of the manufacturer's submission, and summarises the NICE Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance (issued in August 2017). The ERG considered that there were limitations in the approach proposed by the manufacturer for the exacerbation rate and the utility for severe exacerbation. The company amended their initial analysis, following comments from the ERG and the NICE committee, whereby the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was  pound29,870 per QALY gained for reslizumab compared with best standard care. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) concluded that reslizumab was recommended as an option for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma that is inadequately controlled in adults despite maintenance therapy with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another drug, only if (1) the blood eosinophil count has been recorded as 400 cells per microlitre or more and (2) the patient has had three or more asthma exacerbations in the past 12 months, and (3) the company provides reslizumab with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors can co-exist with disability and cause a greater burden on the health status of adults with disabilities. A lack of egalitarian social policies in China may result in gender disparities in the NCD risk factors of adults with disabilities. However, little is known about the gender disparities in the association between socio-demographics and NCD risk factors among adults with disabilities in China; consequently, we examined this association among adults with disabilities in Shanghai, China. METHODS: We used the health examination data of 44,896 adults with disabilities in Shanghai in 2014. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were conducted to estimate gender disparities in the association between socio-demographics, disability characteristics, and four selected NCD risk factors among adults with disabilities-including high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high blood lipids, and being overweight. We estimated marginal effects (MEs) on NCD risk factors between gender and other confounders. RESULTS: Women with disabilities were about 11.6 percentage points more likely to suffer from high blood lipids and less likely to develop the other three risk factors than men were. The association of age group, residence permit, education level, marital status, and disability type with health outcomes varied by gender among adults with disabilities. The difference in age effects between men and women was more pronounced in older age groups. Urban residence was associated with less risk of high blood pressure risk among women (DeltaME =  - 0.035, p < 0.01), but no significant difference in other NCD risk factors. Education remained a major protective factor against high blood pressure, high blood glucose and being overweight among women with disabilities (MEs < 0, p < 0.05); however, this did not hold for men. The difference in marriage effects between men and women was observed in high blood lipids (DeltaME =  - 0.048 for the married group and -0.054 for the divorced or widowed group) and overweight individuals (DeltaME =  - 0.091 for the married group and -0.114 for the divorced or widowed group). Women with intellectual disabilities or mental disabilities reported worse health conditions than men did. DISCUSSION: Preventive strategies and interventions on NCD risk factors for adults with disabilities should take into account gender disparities in these socio-demographic effects. Rural women or poorly educated women with disabilities can be a vulnerable population that requires more health education and promotion strategies. Health education for caregivers of women with intellectual or mental disabilities may also play a vital role in preventing their NCD risk factors.",

We test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses for its widespread persistence. We show that dormancy has evolved numerous times. Most species displaying dormancy exhibit life-history costs of sprouting, and of dormancy. Short-lived and mycoheterotrophic species have higher proportions of dormant plants than long-lived species and species with other nutritional modes. Foliage loss is associated with higher future dormancy levels, suggesting that carbon limitation promotes dormancy. Maximum dormancy duration is shorter under higher precipitation and at higher latitudes, the latter suggesting an important role for competition or herbivory. Study length affects estimates of some demographic parameters. Our results identify life historical and environmental drivers of dormancy. We also highlight the evolutionary importance of the little understood costs of sprouting and growth, latitudinal stress gradients and mixed nutritional modes.",

On a global scale, particulate matter in the atmosphere arises mainly from the combustion process of motorized vehicles, but natural sources are still considered as the major contributors. In Africa, PM emissions differ from those in developed countries; human activities such as biomass burning in households, poor household waste management, and the high number of diesel-powered vehicles are the predominant anthropogenic sources. Natural contributions are also observed. Saharan dust and savanna fires are the most common atmospheric natural sources of particulate matter. The present literature review gives an overview of the status of air quality in African cities and highlights the various sources of particulate matter emissions and local human activities specific to each African region. This could likely serve as a reference to evaluate the current air quality in this region and will be a useful tool in the future to develop pollution mitigation strategies at the source. Recommendations are proposed in the conclusion in order to reduce emissions from their sources, taking into account the low-income African countries.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Crowdsourcing contests (also called innovation challenges, innovation contests, and inducement prize contests) can be used to solicit multisectoral feedback on health programs and design public health campaigns. They consist of organizing a steering committee, soliciting contributions, engaging the community, judging contributions, recognizing a subset of contributors, and sharing with the community. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review describes crowdsourcing contests by stage, examines ethical problems at each stage, and proposes potential ways of mitigating risk. METHODS: Our analysis was anchored in the specific example of a crowdsourcing contest that our team organized to solicit videos promoting condom use in China. The purpose of this contest was to create compelling 1-min videos to promote condom use. We used a scoping review to examine the existing ethical literature on crowdsourcing to help identify and frame ethical concerns at each stage. RESULTS: Crowdsourcing has a group of individuals solve a problem and then share the solution with the public. Crowdsourcing contests provide an opportunity for community engagement at each stage: organizing, soliciting, promoting, judging, recognizing, and sharing. Crowdsourcing poses several ethical concerns: organizing-potential for excluding community voices; soliciting-potential for overly narrow participation; promoting-potential for divulging confidential information; judging-potential for biased evaluation; recognizing-potential for insufficient recognition of the finalist; and sharing-potential for the solution to not be implemented or widely disseminated. CONCLUSIONS: Crowdsourcing contests can be effective and engaging public health tools but also introduce potential ethical problems. We present methods for the responsible conduct of crowdsourcing contests.",

        "abstract": "Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) caused by hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency has severe consequences on brain monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism. We have studied monoamine neurotransmitter status and the effect of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) treatment in Pah(enu1/enu2) (ENU1/2) mice, a model of partial PAH deficiency. These mice exhibit elevated blood L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) concentrations similar to that of mild hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), but brain levels of L-Phe are still ~5-fold elevated compared to wild-type. We found that brain L-tyrosine, L-tryptophan, BH(4) cofactor and catecholamine concentrations, and brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity were normal in these mice but that brain serotonin, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5HIAA) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) content, and brain TH protein, as well as tryptophan hydroxylase type 2 (TPH2) protein levels and activity were reduced in comparison to wild-type mice. Parenteral L-Phe loading conditions did not lead to significant changes in brain neurometabolite concentrations. Remarkably, enteral BH(4) treatment, which normalized brain L-Phe levels in ENU1/2 mice, lead to only partial recovery of brain serotonin and 5HIAA concentrations. Furthermore, indirect evidence indicated that the GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) complex may be a sensor for brain L-Phe elevation to ameliorate the toxic effects of HPA. We conclude that BH(4) treatment of HPA toward systemic L-Phe lowering reverses elevated brain L-Phe content but the recovery of TPH2 protein and activity as well as serotonin levels is suboptimal, indicating that patients with mild HPA and mood problems (depression or anxiety) treated with the current diet may benefit from supplementation with BH(4) and 5-OH-tryptophan.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted the data from all the available pediatric ADR forms submitted to ADR monitoring center (AMC) from May 2014 to December 2016. The data including nature, frequency, causality (World Health Organization [WHO] causality scale), and the severity (Hartwig and Siegel scale for severity) of ADR were extracted. We also assessed the preventability of the event on modified Schumock and Thornton scale of ADR preventability. RESULTS: There were a total of 20 pediatric ADRs reported during this period. Nearly two-thirds of the ADRs occurred in patients who were receiving multiple drugs (polytherapy). Antimicrobial agents were the most commonly implicated drugs. The most common ADRs were skin rash (maculopapular, erythematous, and urticaria, itching, etc.). The severity and preventability scales indicated that most reactions (18/20) were moderate in nature and all were preventable. Four reactions were \"certainly\" and ten ADRs were \"probably\" related to the suspected drug as determined by the WHO causality assessment. CONCLUSION: Frequency of ADR increased with number of medications patient was receiving. Health-care providers (HCPs) involved in the care of children must be aware of this fact and should use additional drugs when absolutely necessary. They should be involved in pharmacovigilance program by exchanging and updating each other through sharing constructive information, communication, and education concerning the appropriate use of drugs in children. Pediatric pharmacovigilance is the need of the hour and should be given utmost importance for monitoring the safety of drugs in children. Motivating HCPs for voluntary reporting of ADRs for preventing the morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population could be of immense importance.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Various types of conduits are available for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction. We have developed an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) conduit with bulging sinuses and a fan-shaped ePTFE valve. This study summarized the results of a multicenter study evaluating the valved ePTFE conduit. METHODS: The valve functions of 902 patients (median age, 3.9 years; median weight, 12.6 kg) who underwent RVOT reconstruction using valved ePTFE conduits (9 different sizes, 8-24 mm in diameter) at 65 hospitals between 2001 and 2015 were retrospectively investigated. Median follow-up time was 5.5 years. The valve functions were assessed using echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and magnetic resonance angiography. RESULTS: There were no deaths related to the ePTFE conduit. The peak RVOT gradient was 16.5 +/- 13.1 mm Hg, and pulmonary insufficiency graded better than mild was 95.9% at the latest follow-up. Conduit replacement was performed in 55 patients, and in only 3 patients because of conduit infection. Freedom from intervention at 5 years and 10 years was 92.3% and 76.1%, respectively, with small conduits (8-16 mm in diameter) and 99.6% and 95.1%, respectively, with large conduits (18-24 mm in diameter). CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcomes of the ePTFE conduit with a fan-shaped valve and bulging sinuses appear clinically satisfactory. We believe that the longevity of small-sized conduits can yield sufficient time to exchange them to larger-sized conduits without any loss of their valve functions. Regarding longevity and resistance to infections, this ePTFE valved conduit can be one of the best ways to reconstruct the RVOT.",

Considering their role in supervising and teaching students during clinical education, it is important that preceptors understand and embody effective characteristics and behaviors. Most existing research on preceptor effectiveness in nursing, medicine, and dietetics professions has examined preceptor and student perceptions of effective behaviors independently. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to investigate effective preceptor behaviors from perspectives of paired preceptors and students affiliated with athletic training programs. PROCEDURES: This qualitative study included interviews of eight paired groups of preceptors (n=8) and athletic training students (n=13) within collegiate, rehabilitation clinic, and high school settings. Data were analyzed using a general inductive approach using open, axial, and selective coding. RESULTS: Our participants concurred that effective preceptors: 1) communicate expectations early and often, 2) demonstrate approachability and openness towards students, 3) provide hands-on patient care responsibilities, and 4) take the time to actively instruct students. CONCLUSIONS: Preceptors are encouraged to exhibit these effective instructional and interpersonal behaviors. Based on these themes, allied health program administrators should provide preceptor trainings that encourage these behaviors to enhance student learning and professional preparation.",

However, measuring the diffusion coefficients or concentration distribution of GNSs within live cells accurately without any extra fluorescent labeling in situ has still not been resolved. In this work, a single particle method is developed to study the concentration distribution of folic acid-modified GNSs (FA-GNSs) internalized via folate receptors, and investigates their diffusion dynamics within live cells using single particle fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We optimized the experimental conditions and verified the feasibility of 30 nm GNSs without extra fluorescence labeling being used for single particle detection inside live cells. Then, the FCS characterization strategy was used to measure the concentration and diffusion coefficient distributions of GNSs inside live cells and the obtained results were basically in agreement with those obtained by TEM. The results demonstrate that our strategy is characterized as an in situ, nondestructive, rapid and dynamic method for the assay of live cells, and it may be widely used in the further design of GNP-based drug delivery and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Exposure to heavy-ion radiation during cancer treatment or space travel may cause cognitive detriments that have been associated with changes in neuron morphology and plasticity. Observations in mice of reduced neuronal dendritic complexity have revealed a dependence on radiation quality and absorbed dose, suggesting that microscopic energy deposition plays an important role. In this work we used morphological data for mouse dentate granular cell layer (GCL) neurons and a stochastic model of particle track structure and microscopic energy deposition (ED) to develop a predictive model of high-charge and energy (HZE) particle-induced morphological changes to the complex structures of dendritic arbors. We represented dendrites as cylindrical segments of varying diameter with unit aspect ratios, and developed a fast sampling method to consider the stochastic distribution of ED by delta rays (secondary electrons) around the path of heavy ions, to reduce computational times. We introduce probabilistic models with a small number of parameters to describe the induction of precursor lesions that precede dendritic snipping, denoted as snip sites. Predictions for oxygen ((16)O, 600 MeV/n) and titanium ((48)Ti, 600 MeV/n) particles with LET of 16.3 and 129 keV/mum, respectively, are considered. Morphometric parameters to quantify changes in neuron morphology are described, including reduction in total dendritic length, number of branch points and branch numbers. Sholl analysis is applied for single neurons to elucidate dose-dependent reductions in dendritic complexity. We predict important differences in measurements from imaging of tissues from brain slices with single neuron cell observations due to the role of neuron death through both soma apoptosis and excessive dendritic length reduction. To further elucidate the role of track structure, random segment excision (snips) models are introduced and a sensitivity study of the effects of the modes of neuron death in predictions of morphometric parameters is described. An important conclusion of this study is that delta rays play a major role in neuron morphological changes due to the large spatial distribution of damage sites, which results in a reduced dependence on LET, including modest difference between (16)O and (48)Ti, compared to damages resulting from ED in localized damage sites.",

The expression of IL-33 was evaluated immunohistochemically using an anti-human IL-33 monoclonal antibody with cross-reactivity to canine IL-33. RESULTS: The transcription levels of il-33 in chronic lesional skin of cAD were significantly higher than those in normal skin of healthy dogs. Keratinocytes were a major cellular source of IL-33 production in chronic lesional skin of cAD.

The remains were identified in a dis-articulated skeletal assemblage from the former necropolis of Juncal (Porto de Mos, Portugal), which probably closed in the late 19th century/early 20th century. They were analysed visually and with X-radiography, and the changes carefully described prior to differential diagnosis. Six bones presented signs of healed bone trauma and one showed features compatible with leg amputation. Periosteal reactions were observed in several bones, one of them resembling changes consistent with an overlying skin ulcer. Two bone fragments were identified as belonging to the same individual due to the matching bone changes. Despite the incomplete remains, a broader diagnosis was possible for most cases, which facilitated a discussion of health, medical and social care among the inhabitants of the region.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ileostomy construction is a common procedure but can be associated with morbidity. The stoma is commonly secured to the skin using transcutaneous sutures. It is hypothesized that intracutaneous sutures result in a tighter adherence of the peristomal skin to the stoma plate to prevent faecal leakage. The study aimed to compare the effect of intracutaneous versus transcutaneous suturing of ileostomies on faecal leakage and quality of life. METHODS: This randomized trial was undertaken in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients scheduled to receive an ileostomy for any reason were randomized to intracutaneous or transcutaneous suturing (IC and TC groups respectively). The primary outcome was faecal leakage. Secondary outcomes were stoma-related quality of life and costs of stoma-related materials and reinterventions. RESULTS: Between April 2011 and February 2016, 339 patients were randomized to the IC (170) or TC (169) group. Leakage rates were higher in the IC than in the TC group (52.4 versus 41.4 per cent respectively; risk difference 11.0 (95 per cent c.i. 0.3 to 21.2) per cent). Skin irritation rates were high (78.2 versus 72.2 per cent), but did not differ significantly between the groups (risk difference 6.1 (95 per cent c.i. -3.2 to 15.10) per cent). There were no significant differences in quality of life or costs between the groups. CONCLUSION: Intracutaneous suturing of an ileostomy is associated with more peristomal leakage than transcutaneous suturing. Overall stoma-related complications did not differ between the two techniques. Registration number: NTR2369 ( http://www.trialregister.nl).",

Longitudinal studies following the cause of a disease or evaluating treatment efficacy are of particular interest but challenging due to the small size of the mouse lung and the fast breathing rate. Synchrotron-based in-line phase-contrast computed tomography imaging has been successfully applied in lung research in various applications, but mostly at dose levels that forbid longitudinal in vivo studies. Here, the novel charge-integrating hybrid detector MONCH is presented, which enables imaging of mouse lungs at a pixel size of 25 microm, in less than 10 s and with an entrance dose of about 70 mGy, which therefore will allow longitudinal lung disease studies to be performed in mouse models.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microvascular dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been associated with poor clinical outcome. Several studies have demonstrated a reduced perfusion reserve proportional to the magnitude of the hypertrophy. We investigated the utility of stress perfusion cardiac MRI to detect microvascular dysfunction in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: From January 2016 to January 2017, 13 patients, with a mean age of 15.3 years, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent regadenoson stress perfusion cardiac MRI (1.5-T Siemens Aera). A single-shot, T1-weighted saturation recovery gradient echo was used for first-pass perfusion in a multiple-slices group, including three short-axis slices and one four-chamber slice. Coronary vasodilatory stress was achieved using bolus injection of regadenoson (lexiscan 0.4 mg/5 ml) and dynamic perfusion during rest and stress performed by administering 0.05 mmol/kg of gadolinium contrast agent (gadoteridol) injected at a rate of 3.5 ml/s, followed by assessment of viability using two-dimensional phase-sensitive inversion recovery of the entire myocardium. RESULTS: All patients completed protocols with no interruptions. In all, seven patients developed perfusion defects after the administration of regadenoson. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy was the most common pattern of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=4) in those with abnormal perfusion. A total of four patients with perfusion defects had a maximum wall thickness <30 mm. The finding of perfusion defects in areas without late gadolinium enhancement in some of our patients indicates that gadolinium enhancement by itself could underestimate the true extension of microvascular disease. Out of seven patients, five patients with positive stress cardiac MRI have undergone implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement based on current guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Regadenoson stress cardiac MRI is feasible and clinically valuable in paediatric patients. It is particularly effective in unmasking abnormal myocardial perfusion in the presence of microvascular dysfunction in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the Systolic Heart failure treatment with the I(f) inhibitor Trial (SHIFT) randomised placebo-controlled trial, ivabradine was shown to reduce hospital admissions for worsening heart failure (HF) and deaths due to HF in patients with symptomatic systolic HF and an elevated resting heart rate (HR). This analysis evaluates the cost effectiveness of adding ivabradine to optimal standard HF treatment in patients with a HR>/=77 bpm. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the impact of ivabradine on mean survival and quality of life over a patient's lifetime (10 years). The hospitalisation and death rates were calculated using patient-level data from SHIFT. The reduction in quality of life due to HF hospitalisations was estimated directly from EQ-5D data collected in SHIFT. Australian costs were applied to the resource use from SHIFT. RESULTS: The modelled mean increase in survival with ivabradine was 0.115 years. The mean increase in quality-adjusted survival was 0.108 years. The average cost of ivabradine was A$2,957 and the cost savings associated with a reduction in HF hospitalisations was A$1,344. The cost per quality adjusted life year gained (QALYG) was A$14,905. The conservative approach to the modelled evaluation, as well as results of the sensitivity analysis, demonstrates that ivabradine is likely to be cost-effective in this indication. CONCLUSIONS: The conservative approach to the modelled evaluation, as well as results of the sensitivity analysis, demonstrates that ivabradine is a cost-effective treatment in the Australian setting for HF patients with a HR>/=77 bpm on optimal standard therapy with a cost per QALYG similar or lower than that for other publicly funded treatments.",

To investigate wheatear Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) has anti-fibrotic effects in CMT, we established acquired muscular torticollis that mimetics CMT in rabbit by intra-SCM injection of anhydrous alcohol. The treatment groups received BTA (2.5units or 5units) injection into the fibrotic SCM. The shortening and thickening of SCM were recorded by B-mode ultrasound. Changes in Col1A1, Fn, alpha-SMA expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. In vitro studies, TGF-beta induced NIH3T3 fibroblasts were used to evaluate anti-fibrosis effect of BTA. Expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha-SMA and fibrosis markers Col1A1 and Fn were detected by Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. Our results showed that BTA injection attenuated shortening and thickening of fibrotic SCM. Elevated expression of Col1A1, Fn, alpha-SMA were confirmed in this fibrotic muscle model but reversed after BTA injection. Similar results observed in TGF-beta induced NIH3T3 fibroblasts in both mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, our results suggested that BTA could be a promising agent against SCM fibrosis in CMT through regulating fibroblast and inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Taiwanese male patients who were dissatisfied with treatment with 0.2 mg tamsulosin were enrolled in this clinical study and switched to 0.4 mg tamsulosin OCAS. Efficacy was assessed over a 12-week period by an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire and analysis of urinary flow by uroflowmetry. RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement was observed in total IPSS scores from baseline (14.94+/-7.41, moderate) to 12 weeks (7.36+/-5.77, mild) in 81 patients who were switched from 0.2 to 0.4 mg tamsulosin OCAS (P<0.001). The IPSS subscores for storage, voiding, nocturia, and quality of life (QOL) were also significantly improved over the 12-week period. Uroflowmetry analysis demonstrated significantly increased maximum flow rate, average flow rate, and mean voided volume from baseline to the end of the 12-week period. The 0.4 mg tamsulosin OCAS dose was well tolerated, with only mild dizziness (five patients) and headache (two patients) as the most frequent adverse events. No clinically significant reduction was observed in blood pressure or vital signs. CONCLUSION: Treatment with 0.4 mg tamsulosin OCAS in Taiwanese men with LUTS associated with BPH who were dissatisfied with 0.2 mg tamsulosin significantly improved IPSS scores, urinary flow, and QOL and was well tolerated, suggesting that this should be the recommended dose offered to Taiwanese male patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aboriginal peoples in Canada are comprised of First Nations, Metis, and Inuit. Health care services for First Nations who live on rural and remote reserves are mostly provided by the Government of Canada through the federal department, Health Canada. One Health Canada policy, the evacuation policy, requires all First Nations women living on rural and remote reserves to leave their communities between 36 and 38 weeks gestational age and travel to urban centres to await labour and birth. Although there are a few First Nations communities in Canada that have re-established community birthing and Aboriginal midwifery is growing, most First Nations communities are still reliant on the evacuation policy for labour and birthing services. In one Canadian province, Manitoba, First Nations women are evacuated to The Pas, Thompson, or Winnipeg but most - including all women with high-risk pregnancies - go to Winnipeg. AIM: To contribute scholarship that describes First Nations women's and community members' experiences and perspectives of Health Canada's evacuation policy in Manitoba. METHODS: Applying intersectional theory to data collected through 12 semi-structured interviews with seven women and five community members (four females, one male) in Manitoba who had experienced the evacuation policy. The data were analyzed thematically, which revealed three themes: resignation, resilience, and resistance. FINDINGS: The theme of resignation was epitomized by the quote, \"Nobody has a choice.\" The ability to withstand and endure the evacuation policy despite poor or absent communication and loneliness informed of resilience. Resistance was demonstrated by women who questioned the necessity and requirement of evacuation for labour and birth. In one instance, resistance took the form of a planned homebirth with Aboriginal registered midwives. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need to improve the maternity care services that First Nations women receive when they are evacuated out of their communities, particularly when understood from the specific legal and constitutional position of First Nations women in Manitoba.",

Mechanisms that may explain the premature and rapidly progressive nature of atherosclerosis in diabetes are multiple, and to a large extent still unclear. However, mechanisms related to hyperglycemia certainly play an important role. These include a dysregulated vascular regeneration. In addition, oxidative and hyperosmolar stresses, as well as the activation of inflammatory pathways triggered by a dysregulated activation of membrane channel proteins aquaporins, have been recognized as key events. Here, we review recent knowledge of cellular and molecular pathways of macrovascular disease related to hyperglycemia in diabetes. We also here highlight how new insights into pathogenic mechanisms of vascular damage in diabetes may indicate new targets for prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Hydrodynamic phenomena are ubiquitous in living organisms and can be used to manipulate cells or emulate physiological microenvironments experienced in vivo. Hydrodynamic effects influence multiple cellular properties and processes, including cell morphology, intracellular processes, cell-cell signaling cascades and reaction kinetics, and play an important role at the single-cell, multicellular, and organ level. Selected hydrodynamic effects can also be leveraged to control mechanical stresses, analyte transport, as well as local temperature within cellular microenvironments. With a better understanding of fluid mechanics at the micrometer-length scale and the advent of microfluidic technologies, a new generation of experimental tools that provide control over cellular microenvironments and emulate physiological conditions with exquisite accuracy is now emerging. Accordingly, we believe that it is timely to assess the concepts underlying hydrodynamic control of cellular microenvironments and their applications and provide some perspective on the future of such tools in in vitro cell-culture models. Generally, we describe the interplay between living cells, hydrodynamic stressors, and fluid flow-induced effects imposed on the cells. This interplay results in a broad range of chemical, biological, and physical phenomena in and around cells. More specifically, we describe and formulate the underlying physics of hydrodynamic phenomena affecting both adhered and suspended cells. Moreover, we provide an overview of representative studies that leverage hydrodynamic effects in the context of single-cell studies within microfluidic systems.",

This study sought to test the feasibility of computerized response inhibition training for children with trichotillomania. Twenty-two children were randomized to the 8-session response inhibition training (RIT; n = 12) or a waitlisted control (WLT; n = 10). Primary outcomes were assessed by an independent evaluator, using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), and the NIMH Trichotillomania Severity (NIMH-TSS) and Impairment scales (NIMH-TIS) at pre, post-training/waiting, and 1-month follow-up. Relative to the WLT group, the RIT group showed a higher response rate (55% vs. 11%) on the CGI-I and a lower level of impairment on the NIMH-TIS, at post-training. Overall symptom reductions rates on the NIMH-TSS were 34% (RIT) vs. 21% (WLT) at post-training. The RIT's therapeutic gains were maintained at 1-month follow-up, as indicated by the CGI-I responder status (= 66%), and a continuing reduction in symptom on the NIMH-TSS. This pattern of findings was also replicated by the 6 waitlisted children who received the same RIT intervention after post-waiting assessment. Results suggest that computerized RIT may be a potentially useful intervention for trichotillomania.",

To identify the attributes that nonregular consumers appreciated, 12 commercial products bought from a Hong Kong market were tested by 113 consumers according to the ideal profile method (IPM), and rated on 22 attributes. RESULTS: Data provided from nonregular consumers were consistent at both panel and consumer levels. The predicted ideal profile received a higher hedonic score (7.0) than the tested products (6.0). Compared with commercial samples, the ideal sufu has low intensity in the attributes of fermented (aroma and flavor), moldy (aroma), and hard (texture), but high intensity in the soybean-like (aroma and flavor) and sesame oil-like (aroma and flavor) attributes. CONCLUSION: IPM could be used as an alternative approach to collect sensory profiles and preference data directly from consumers for product characterization. It could also be applied to identify the attributes that nonregular consumers appreciated. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.",

A quasi-experimental study was conducted among hospitalized HIV-infected patients between the period from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2014 (preintervention period) and 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2015 (intervention period). During the intervention period, an HIV care team consisting of an Infectious Diseases physician, a nurse, a pharmacist, a social worker, and an HIV-infected volunteer made daily inpatient rounds. Prior to discharge, patients received a structured HIV education session and an outpatient appointment was scheduled for them with two telephone reminder calls following discharge. There were 240 HIV-infected patients enrolled (120 in each study period), of which the median age was 37 years (interquartile range [IQR] 28-44 years), 58% were male, 39% were newly diagnosed with HIV infection, 46% were hospitalized because of AIDS-related conditions, and the median CD4 cell count on admission was 158 cells/microl (IQR 72-382 cells/microl). The rate of HIV care engagement within 30 days after discharge was significantly higher in the intervention period compared to the preintervention period (95% versus 69%; P < 0.001). Independent factors associated with no care engagement within 30 days were patients in the preintervention period (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.36; P < 0.001) and new diagnosis of HIV infection (aOR 2.77; P = 0.009). The study findings suggest that enhanced inpatient rounds, appointment reminders, and patient education were shown to be associated with improved HIV care engagement after hospital discharge.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of MF on the healing of DES in human coronary arteries of patients with diabetes mellitus by optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS: The RESERVOIR trial randomized 116 lesions in 112 patients with diabetes mellitus to amphilimus- or everolimus-eluting stents and included mandatory OCT at 9 months of follow-up. Patients were divided in 3 groups according to the glucose-lowering agents received: a) no MF; b) MF in noninsulin treated patients, and c) MF in insulin-treated patients. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of uncovered stents. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with 19 lesions did not receive MF, whereas MF was administered to 53 noninsulin treated patients (54 lesions) and 28 insulin-treated patients (28 lesions). Baseline characteristics were comparable, although noninsulin treated patients who received MF had better glycemic control (P < .01). By OCT, rates of uncovered struts were comparable between groups (3.07+/-4.80% vs 2.23+/-4.73% vs 3.43+/-6.69%, respectively; P = .48). Multivariate models confirmed that MF had no effect on the healing of DES (OR, 1.49, 95%CI, 0.71-3.08; P = .29). Similarly, quantitative angiography showed no effect of MF on late lumen loss, whereas patients treated with exogenous insulin had greater late lumen loss (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use does not impair endothelial healing of DES in patients with both insulin- and noninsulin-treated diabetes mellitus. According to these results, MF should not be discouraged in these patients.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of hemophilia treatment and care is a fascinating one but has been fraught with many challenges at every turn. Over the last 50 years or so patients with hemophilia and providers have witnessed great advances in the treatment of this disease. With these advances, there has been a dramatic decrease in the mortality and morbidity associated with hemophilia. Even with the remarkable advancements in treatment, however, new and old challenges continue to plague the hemophilia community. The cost of factor replacement and the frequency of infusions, especially in patients with severe hemophilia on prophylaxis, remains a significant challenge for this population. Other challenges include obtaining reliable venous access, especially in younger patients, and the development of neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors). The development of extended half-life products, a bispecific antibody which mimics the coagulation function of factor VIII (FVIII) and inhibition of anticoagulation proteins such as antithrombin with antibodies, aptamers or RNA interference technology have offered novel therapeutic approaches to overcome some of these existing challenges. Additionally, ongoing gene therapy research offers a way to possibly cure hemophilia. These novel treatment tools in conjunction with the establishment of an increasing number of comprehensive hemophilia centers and worldwide advocacy efforts have continued to push the progress of hemophilia care to new frontiers. This review highlights and summarizes these novel therapeutic approaches and the current clinical progress of hemophilia A.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many interventions have been developed to promote respect and social inclusion among older people, but the evidence on their impacts on health has not been synthesised. This systematic review aims to appraise the state of the evidence across the quantitative and qualitative literature. METHODS: Eligible studies published between 1990 and 2015 were identified by scanning seven bibliographic databases using a pre-piloted strategy, searching grey literature and contacting experts. Studies were included if they assessed the impact (quantitatively) and/or perceived impact (qualitatively) of an intervention promoting respect and social inclusion on the physical or mental health of community-residing people aged 60 years and older. Titles and abstracts were screened for eligibility by one reviewer. A second reviewer independently screened a 10% random sample. Full texts were screened for eligibility by one reviewer, with verification by another reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using standardised tools. Findings were summarised using narrative synthesis, harvest plots and logic models to depict the potential pathways to health outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 27,354 records retrieved, 40 studies (23 quantitative, 6 qualitative, 11 mixed methods) were included. All studies were conducted in high and upper middle-income countries. Interventions involved mentoring, intergenerational and multi-activity programmes, dancing, music and singing, art and culture and information-communication technology. Most studies (n = 24) were at high or moderate risk of bias. Music and singing, intergenerational interventions, art and culture and multi-activity interventions were associated with an overall positive impact on health outcomes. This included depression (n = 3), wellbeing (n = 3), subjective health (n = 2), quality of life (n = 2), perceived stress and mental health (n = 2) and physical health (n = 2). Qualitative studies offered explanations for mediating factors (e.g. improved self-esteem) that may lead to improved health outcomes and contributed to the assessment of causation. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst this review suggests that some interventions may positively impact on the health outcomes of older people, and identified mediating factors to health outcomes, the evidence is based on studies with heterogeneous methodologies. Many of the interventions were delivered as projects to selected groups, raising important questions about the feasibility of wider implementation and the potential for population-wide benefits.

Various microbial taxa are currently used as biofertilizers, based on their capacity to access nutrients from fertilizers and soil stocks, to fix atmospheric nitrogen, to improve water uptake or to act as biocontrol agents. Despite the existence of a considerable knowledge on effects of specific taxa of biofertilizers, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the performance of biofertilizers with different traits such as phosphorus solubilization and N fixation applied to various crops at a global scale is missing. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify benefits of biofertilizers in terms of yield increase, nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency, based on 171 peer reviewed publications that met eligibility criteria. Major findings are: (i) the superiority of biofertilizer performance in dry climates over other climatic regions (yield response: dry climate +20.0 +/- 1.7%, tropical climate +14.9 +/- 1.2%, oceanic climate +10.0 +/- 3.7%, continental climate +8.5 +/- 2.4%); (ii) meta-regression analyses revealed that yield response due to biofertilizer application was generally small at low soil P levels; efficacy increased along higher soil P levels in the order arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), P solubilizers, and N fixers; (iii) meta-regressions showed that the success of inoculation with AMF was greater at low organic matter content and at neutral pH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immature SD rat was treated by OVA to construct allergic asthma model and intervened by DXM. The rats were randomly divided into model group, experimental group, and control group. The changes in lung tissue were observed by light microscope. The EOS infiltration and reactivity of airway wall were compared. The expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 protein and mRNA in the lung tissue were tested by Western blot and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The lung tissue in the model group was infiltrated by a lot of inflammatory cells, and mucous membrane edema was observed, compared with that in the control group. There were only a few inflammatory cells in the interstitial tissue and pulmonary alveoli in the experimental group compared with that in the model group. EOS count of airway wall and airway reactivity decreased in the experimental group. The levels of TLR2 and TLR4 were significantly elevated in the third week compared with the first week (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of DXM can alleviate the pathological changes of the lung tissue in SD immature rat with allergic asthma, reduce EOS infiltration in the airway wall, decrease airway reactivity, and elevate expressions of TLR2 and TLR4.",

Neuromuscular, biochemical, endocrine, and mood responses to small-sided games' training in professional soccer. J Strength Cond Res 32(9): 2569-2576, 2018-The 24-hour responses to small-sided games' (SSGs) soccer training were characterized. Professional soccer players (n = 16) performed SSG's (4vs4 + goalkeepers; 6 x 7-minutes, 2-minute interset recovery) with performance (peak power output [PPO] and jump height [JH]), physiological (blood creatine kinase [CK], lactate, salivary testosterone, and cortisol), and mood measures collected before (baseline), and after (immediately; 0, +2, and +24 hours). For PPO and JH, possibly small-moderate reductions occurred at 0 hour (-1.1 W.kg; +/-0.9 W.kg, -3.2 cm; +/-1.9 cm, respectively), before returning to baseline at +2 hours (trivial), and declining thereafter (small-moderate effect) at +24 hours (-0.9 W.kg; +/-0.8 W.kg, -2.5 cm; +/-1.2 cm, respectively). Lactate increased at 0 hours (likely large; +1.3 mmol.L; +/-0.5 mmol.L), reduced at +2 hours (likely-small; -0.5 mmol.L; +/-0.2 mmol.L), and returned to baseline at 24 hours (trivial). A very likely small increase in CK occurred at 0 hour (+97 mu.L; +/-28 mu.L), persisting for +24 hours (very likely small; +94 mu.L; +/-49 mu.L). Possibly small increases in testosterone (+20 pg.ml; +/-29 pg.ml) occurred at 0 hour, before likely moderate declines at +2 hours (-61 pg.ml; +/-21 pg.ml) returning to baseline at +24 hours (trivial). For cortisol, possibly small decreases occurred at 0 hour (-0.09 mug.dl; +/-0.16 mug.dl), before likely large decreases at +2 hours (-0.39 mug.dl; +/-0.12 mug.dl), which persisted for 24 hours (likely small; -0.12 mug.dl; +/-0.11 mug.dl). Mood was disturbed by SSG's at 0 hour (likely moderate; +13.6 AU, +/-5.6 AU) and +2 hours (likely small; +7.9 AU; +/-5.0 AU), before returning to baseline at +24 hours (trivial). The movement demands of SSG's result in a bimodal recovery pattern of neuromuscular function and perturbations in physiological responses and mood for up to 24 hours. Accordingly, when programming soccer training, SSG's should be periodized throughout the competitive week with submaximal technical/tactical activities.",

        "abstract": "A chicken multiplex cytokine assay (Bio-Plex) to detect four different cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IL-10, and interferon gamma) simultaneously in plasma samples was designed. Most standard curves range between 1 to 5 pg/mL and 5,000 pg/mL, except for IFNgamma with the range of 50 to 25,000 pg/mL. Such a chicken multiplex assay proved to be fast and reliable, and comparable in sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility to conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Comparison of the multiplex assay with the ELISA technique using the same clones of detection and capture antibodies resulted in correlation coefficients for all cytokines ranging from 0.95 to 0.99. Lower limit of detection and limit of quantification values were obtained for all tested cytokines by the Bio-Plex assay compared with ELISA. To reduce the risk of cross-reaction with other proteins, the Bio-Plex system was used, combining the principle of sandwich immunoassay with the Luminex bead-based technology. The cytokine standard recoveries for each cytokine varied between 86 and 118% in dynamic concentration ranges. A chicken multiplex cytokine assay (Bio-Plex) provided a more complete picture of differences between the Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles of the immunized via a new system of antigen delivery into chicken antigen-presenting cells and control groups. This multiplexed fluorescent-bead-based detection assay can be used as a quantitative or comparative tool for the study of the chicken ex vivo cellular immune response.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the potential ocular toxicity of a combined BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) + MEK inhibition (MEKi) + hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) regime used to treat metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma. METHODS: Patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma and BRAF V600E mutations (n = 11, 31-68 years of age) were included. Treatment was with oral dabrafenib, 150 mg bid, trametinib, 2 mg/day, and HCQ, 400 mg to 600 mg bid. An ophthalmic examination, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, near-infrared and short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence, and static perimetry were performed at baseline, 1 month, and q/6 months after treatment. RESULTS: There were no clinically significant ocular events; there was no ocular inflammation. The only medication-related change was a separation of the photoreceptor outer segment tip from the apical retinal pigment epithelium that could be traced from the fovea to the perifoveal retina noted in 9/11 (82%) of the patients. There were no changes in retinal pigment epithelium melanization or lipofuscin content by near-infrared fundus autofluorescence and short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence, respectively. There were no inner retinal or outer nuclear layer changes. Visual acuities and sensitivities were unchanged. CONCLUSION: BRAFi (trametinib) + MEKi (dabrafenib) + HCQ causes very frequent, subclinical separation of the photoreceptor outer segment from the apical retinal pigment epithelium without inner retinal changes or signs of inflammation. The changes suggest interference with the maintenance of the outer retinal barrier and/or phagocytic/pump functions of the retinal pigment epithelium by effective MEK inhibition.",

However, whether DcR3 can be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of cancer metastasis is unclear. In this study, sera from healthy controls and patients with different cancers were collected, and tested for their DcR3 levels by ELISA. Significantly elevated DcR3 levels were observed in the sera of patients with gastric cancer (2.04 +/- 1.01, P = 0.0061), lymphoma (1.62 +/- 0.75, P = 0.041), and breast cancer (1.53 +/- 0.51, P = 0.023). DcR3 was found to be a suitable biomarker for identifying gastric cancer patients. Importantly, DcR3 was positively associated with platelet distribution width (PDW) (P = 2.45 x 10(-6), R = 0.63) in metastatic cancers but negatively associated with hemoglobin (HGB) (P = 0.002, R = -0.59) and hematocrit (HCT) (P = 0.001, R = -0.62) in non-metastatic cancers. Combined with PDW, HGB and HCT, serum DcR3 could be used to predict the occurrence of cancer metastasis. These findings indicate that DcR3 could be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of gastric cancer, and for cancer metastasis in combination with hematological traits.",

We aimed to investigate the clinical and pathological differences between low-AFP-secreting (AFP < 20 ng/mL) and high-AFP-secreting (AFP >/= 20 ng/mL) hepatocellular carcinomas in patients who undergo liver transplant (LT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 145 patients who underwent deceased donor LT for HCC from January 1, 2005 until August 1, 2015 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. RESULTS: Median pre-LT AFP in the entire cohort was 13 ng/mL (IQR 6-59). Using serum AFP cutoff of 20 ng/mL, 61 (42%) patients had high-AFP-secreting tumors and 84 (58%) had low-AFP-secreting tumors. Patients with high-AFP-secreting tumors had larger lesions (3 cm vs. 2.4 cm, p = 0.024), and were more likely to have microvascular-invasion (36.1% vs. 20.2%, p = 0.02) and poor-differentiation (18% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.01), and tumor recurrence following LT (28% vs. 6%, p < 0.001). The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year recurrence-free survival for patients in the low-AFP-secreting group compared to the high-AFP-secreting group were 100%, 92%, 92% vs. 81.3%, 71.3%, 68.5% respectively (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: AFP is a suboptimal predictor of tumor recurrence following liver transplant in HCC patients. However, it can have some value in distinguishing more aggressive forms of HCC (high-AFP-secreting) that are associated with higher tumor recurrence. Novel tumor biomarkers are needed that can enhance predicting tumor recurrence following LT based on tumor biology.",

RESULTS: Increasing PPVs were significantly associated with decline in A1C levels in females. Every 10% increase in PPVs resulted in a 0.18% decrease in A1C levels (p<0.0001). To achieve a clinically important decrease of 1% in A1C levels, a 56% increase in PPVs was required. Increased A1C levels were significantly associated with higher baseline A1C levels (p<0.001) and increased hospital days for foot complications (p<0.0052).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bioactive casein peptides have attracted considerable attention for their applications in industry. However, there is little clarity regarding mass spectrometric profiles for peptides in enzymatic hydrolysates of casein produced under varying conditions. In this study, the compositions of the peptides from casein hydrolysates were compared for different enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S) and hydrolysis times. The toxicity, allergenicity and bioactivity of the identified peptides were assessed in silico. RESULTS: A total of 70 unique peptides were identified, and there were 28, 21, 13 and 8 peptides from alpha(s1) -casein, alpha(s2) -casein, beta-casein and kappa-casein respectively. The peptide number decreased with the increase in E/S and hydrolysis time. Moreover, peptides with relative molecular mass M(r) ranging from 1000 to 1500 Da occupied the highest proportion of 31.43%, and almost all of the peptides showed M(r) less than 5000 Da. In silico analysis showed that all of the peptides were non-toxic and non-allergenic, and several of them were assessed by PeptideRanker as having a relatively high likelihood of being bioactive peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Composition of the peptides in the casein hydrolysates varied with the enzymolysis conditions. This study's results may facilitate the production of target bioactive peptides by controlling E/S and hydrolysis time, which is beneficial for the application of casein peptides in the functional food industry.

Exercise stress testing (EST) is used to evaluate CV functions in men with ED. Low exercise workload, a slower heart rate recovery (HRR) after exercise, and inability to increase heart rate during EST (chronotropic incompetence) are independent negative predictors of adverse CV outcomes. AIM: To assess the association among EST parameters, ED, and testosterone levels. METHODS: The study population consisted of 41 patients with ED and 40 controls. All participants underwent treadmill EST to assess cardiac autonomic functions. HRR indices were calculated by subtracting 1st (HRR1), 2nd (HRR2), and 3rd (HRR3) minute heart rates during the recovery period from maximal heart rate. Total exercise duration, exercise capacity and chronotropic response, and plasma testosterone levels were evaluated. Erectile functions were evaluated with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men. Patients were divided into subgroups according to severity and duration of ED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean HRR1 (30.6 +/- 11.9 vs 36.9 +/- 9.9; P = .01), HRR2 (44.9 +/- 12.4 vs 54.9 +/- 7.8; P < .001), and HRR3 (50.1 +/- 11.7 vs 63.0 +/- 7.9; P < .001) were significantly lower in the ED than in the control group. Total exercise duration (9.4 +/- 1.9 vs 10.9 +/- 1.7 minutes; P < .001), exercise capacity (12.5 +/- 1.9 vs 13.6 +/- 1.4 metabolic equivalents; P = .004), and chronotropic response (0.88 +/- 0.1 vs 1.0 +/- 0.1; P < .001) were worse in the ED group. However, we found no association between severity and duration of ED and EST parameters. In addition, serum testosterone levels were significantly correlated with HRR1 (r = 0.36, P = .02) in men with ED. CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that cardiac autonomic functions are impaired in patients with ED. A weak correlation between cardiac autonomic dysfunction and low testosterone levels in patients with ED was noted. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the prognostic significance and clinical implications of impaired autonomic functions and testosterone replacement therapy in patients with ED.

The donors and the body donation programme at Khon Kaen University, northeast Thailand, reflect all these aspects of Thailand, including the status accorded to the donors and the ceremonial acknowledgement of the donors and their families. METHODS: Data from the programme records and from surveys of samples of currently registering donors and recently received donor bodies are analysed to define the characteristics of both registering and received donors, including motivation, demography, socio-economic status, health, and use of the bodies. FINDINGS: The body donation programme at Khon Kaen University currently has a very high rate of registration of body donors, with gender and age differences in the patterns of donation. Registrants include more females than males, a long-standing pattern, and are an average age of 50 years. The bodies of 12% of registrants are received after death and include more males than females. Both sexes are of an average age of 69 years. Males had registered their donation eight years prior to death and females ten years prior. Current registrants identified altruistic motives for their decision to donate, although the coincidence of body donation by a highly revered monk with a surge in donations in 2015 suggests that Buddhism plays a primary role in motivation. The opportunity to make merit for donors and their families, and respect shown to donors and the nature of the ceremonies acknowledging the donors and their families, including the use of the Royal Flame at the cremation ceremony, all contribute to decisions to donate. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of body donors and the body donation programme at Khon Kaen University are reflective of Thai society and the centrality of Buddhism to Thai culture.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, 25.5 million people are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), representing 70% of the global total. The need for second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) is projected to increase in the next decade in keeping with the expansion of treatment provision. Outcome data are required to inform policy. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the virological outcomes of protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary outcome was virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL) after 48 and 96 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with PI resistance. Pooled aggregate data were analyzed using a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. RESULTS: By intention-to-treat analysis, virological suppression occurred in 69.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.2%-79.3%) of patients at week 48 (4558 participants, 14 studies), and in 61.5% (95% CI, 47.2%-74.9%) at week 96 (2145 participants, 8 studies). Preexisting resistance to nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) increased the likelihood of virological suppression. Major protease resistance mutations occurred in a median of 17% (interquartile range, 0-25%) of the virological failure population and increased with duration of second-line ART. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients receiving PI-based second-line ART with continued NRTI use in sub-Saharan Africa did not achieve virological suppression, although among viremic patients, protease resistance was infrequent. Significant challenges remain in implementation of viral load monitoring. Optimizing definitions and strategies for management of second-line ART failure is a research priority.

Two streptavidin isoforms were yielded with improved catalytic activity and selectivity for the reduction of cyclic imines. The evolved ATHases were stable under biphasic catalytic conditions. The X-ray structure analysis reveals that introducing bulky residues within the active site results in flexibility changes of the cofactor, thus increasing exposure of the metal to the protein surface and leading to a reversal of enantioselectivity. This hypothesis was confirmed by a multiscale approach based mostly on molecular dynamics and protein-ligand dockings.",

METHOD: The Hebrew Narrow Focus Test (HNFT) was used. The HNFT includes 3 subtests. The first subtest (A) required identification of the stressed word in the sentence based on psychoacoustic abilities alone. The second (B) and third (C) subtests required understanding the meaning of focused stress in different contexts. In subtest B, the meaning of \"narrow focus\" was to contrast other possibilities related to the lexical-grammatical role of the stressed word in the sentence, whereas in subtest C, the meaning was to indicate a mistake. RESULTS: ASD participants showed reduced performance compared to peers across all the subtests of the HNFT, but similar performance compared to TD children in subtests A and B and better performance on subtest C. A significant correlation was found between the Raven test for assessing nonverbal intelligence and subtests B and C of the HNFT in the group of adolescents with ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehension of narrow focus in adolescents with ASD who study in a special educational system is related to their cognitive-linguistic abilities and not to the autistic condition by itself or to its severity.",

The objective of this study was to assess the reliability and accuracy of a PSG in replicating the planned glenoid component position during total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). HYPOTHESIS: Additional criteria should be used for 3D preoperative planning and PSG design to further improve the accuracy of glenoid component positioning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 10 patients who underwent TSA with use of a PSG to position the glenoid component after preoperative 3D planning. Postoperative glenoid version and tilt were measured and compared to the planned values. We also used new criteria to assess implant rotation and global 3D position, as well as accuracy of the 3D pilot hole for the glenoid guide-pin. RESULTS: Mean errors in glenoid position were -1.7 degrees +/-4.4 degrees  for version, -0.4 degrees +/-4.9 degrees  for tilt, and 6.0 degrees +/-13.5 degrees for rotation. Mean difference in global orientation of the glenoid implant versus the planned value was 4.9 degrees +/-2.5 degrees . Mean 3D discrepancy in glenoid pilot hole position was 2.9+/-0.5mm; the discrepancy was greater in the mediolateral direction (1.9+/-0.9mm) than in the supero-inferior (1.1+/-1.2mm) and antero-posterior (0.8+/-1.2mm) directions. DISCUSSION: The poor performance of the PSG in controlling rotation and reaming may explain the difference in global glenoid position compared to the planned value. Improvements in PSG design to incorporate these two parameters deserve consideration. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, prospective cohort study.",

        "abstract": "Neoplastic cells display reprogrammed metabolism due to the heightened energetic demands and the need for biomass synthesis of a growing tumor. Targeting metabolic vulnerabilities is thus an important goal for cancer therapy. Here, we describe a novel small-molecule arylsulfonamide (N-cyclobutyl-N-((2,2-dimethyl-2H-pyrano[3,2-b]pyridin-6-yl)methyl)-3,4-dimethoxybenzenesulfonamide) that exerts potent cytotoxicity and energetic stress on tumor cells while largely sparing non-cancerous human cells. In tumor cells, it stimulates glycolysis and accelerates glucose consumption. Consequently, intracellular ATP levels plummet, triggering activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and diminishing the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling. In orthotopic triple-negative breast cancer and subcutaneous lung cancer mouse models, this arylsulfonamide robustly suppresses primary tumor growth, inhibits the formation of distant metastases to the lung, and extends mouse survival while being very well tolerated. These therapeutic effects are further potentiated by co-administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose analog and glycolysis inhibitor. Collectively, our findings provide preclinical proof of concept for the further development of this arylsulfonamide in combination with 2-DG towards cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood. Recently, we identified a critical window early in the life of both mice and Canadian infants during which gut microbial changes (dysbiosis) affect asthma development. Given geographic differences in human gut microbiota worldwide, we studied the effects of gut microbial dysbiosis on atopic wheeze in a population living in a distinct developing world environment. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether microbial alterations in early infancy are associated with the development of atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized setting. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within a birth cohort from rural Ecuador in which we identified 27 children with atopic wheeze and 70 healthy control subjects at 5 years of age. We analyzed bacterial and eukaryotic gut microbiota in stool samples collected at 3 months of age using 16S and 18S sequencing. Bacterial metagenomes were predicted from 16S rRNA data by using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States and categorized by function with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ontology. Concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids were determined by using gas chromatography. RESULTS: As previously observed in Canadian infants, microbial dysbiosis at 3 months of age was associated with later development of atopic wheeze. However, the dysbiosis in Ecuadorian babies involved different bacterial taxa, was more pronounced, and also involved several fungal taxa. Predicted metagenomic analysis emphasized significant dysbiosis-associated differences in genes involved in carbohydrate and taurine metabolism. Levels of the fecal short-chain fatty acids acetate and caproate were reduced and increased, respectively, in the 3-month stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of atopic wheeze and provide additional support for considering modulation of the gut microbiome as a primary asthma prevention strategy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) (C342Y/+) mutation is a known cause of Crouzon syndrome that is characterised by craniosynostosis and midfacial hypoplasia. Our aim was to conduct extensive phenotyping of the maxillary, mandibular and dental morphology associated with this mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Morphometric data were obtained from 40 mice, representing two genotypes (Crouzon and wild-type) and two sexes (males and females) (n=10 in each group). Dental analysis further categorised the first molars into the two jaws (maxillary and mandibular) (n=20 in each group). Maxillary, mandibular and dental morphology was compared by analysing 23 linear landmark-based dimensions in three-dimensional micro-computed tomography reconstructions. RESULTS: Compared with wild-type, Crouzon (FGFR2(C342Y/+)) maxillae were significantly shorter in maximum height, anterior and posterior lengths and middle width, but larger in posterior width (p<0.05 for height; p<0.001 for other comparisons). In the Crouzon mandible, the ascending and descending heights, effective and mandibular lengths, and intercoronoid and intercondylar widths were significantly shorter, whereas intergonial width was larger (p<0.01 for intercondylar width; p<0.001 for other comparisons). Crouzon teeth were significantly smaller mesiodistally, but larger in crown height (p<0.001 for each comparison). All Crouzon mice presented with bifid mandibular condyles and a quarter presented with expansive bone lesions in the mandibular incisor alveolus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of hypoplasia in all three planes in Crouzon maxillae and mandibles, together with the presence of bifid mandibular condyles and expansive bone lesions, may be relevant to maxillofacial surgery and orthodontics. Beyond skeletal effects, the FGFR2(C342Y/+) mutation is now implicated in affecting tooth development. This study's skeletal phenomics data also provides baseline data against which the effect of various treatments can now be assessed.",

While the modulation of the speed of transcription of individual genes and its role in regulation and proper protein folding has been analyzed in depth, the functional relevance of differences in transcription speeds as well as the factors influencing it have not yet been determined on a genome-wide scale. Here we determined transcription speeds for the majority of E. coli genes based on experimental data. We find large differences in transcription speed between individual genes and a strong influence of both cellular location as well as the relative importance of genes for cellular function on transcription speeds. Investigating factors influencing transcription speeds we observe both codon composition as well as factors associated to DNA topology as most important factors influencing transcription speeds. Moreover, we show that differences in transcription speeds are sufficient to explain the timing of regulatory responses during environmental shifts and highlight the importance of the consideration of transcription speeds in the design of experiments measuring transcriptomic responses to perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Stingless bees produce geopropolis, which is popularly described for its medicinal properties, but for which few scientific studies have demonstrated pharmacological effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the chemical composition of the geopropolis of Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides and to evaluate its antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities. The composition of the hydroethanolic extract of geopropolis (HEG) included di- and trigalloyl and phenylpropanyl heteroside derivatives, flavanones, diterpenes, and triterpenes. HEG showed antioxidant action via the direct capture of free radicals and by inhibiting the levels of oxidative hemolysis and malondialdehyde in human erythrocytes under oxidative stress. HEG also reduced the frequency of gene conversion and the number of mutant colonies of S. cerevisiae. The anti-inflammatory action of HEG was demonstrated by the inhibition of hyaluronidase enzyme activity. In addition, HEG induced cell death in all evaluated gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts, including clinical isolates with antimicrobial drug resistance. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of M. q. anthidioides geopropolis for the prevention and treatment of various diseases related to oxidative stress, mutagenesis, inflammatory processes, and microbial infections.",

        "abstract": "Extent of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor size, and patient age are important prognostic variables for patients with osteosarcoma, but applying information from these continuous variables in survival models is difficult. Dichotomization is usually inappropriate and alternative statistical techniques should be considered instead. Nonlinear multivariable regression methods (restricted cubic splines and fractional polynomials) were applied to data from the National Cancer Database to model continuous prognostic factors for overall survival from localized, high-grade osteosarcoma of the appendicular and nonspinal skeleton following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection (N=2493). The assumption that log hazard ratios were linear in relation to these continuous prognostic factors was tested using likelihood ratio tests of model deviance and Wald tests of spline coefficients. Log hazard ratios for increasing patient age were linear over the range of 4 to 80 years, but showed evidence for variation in the coefficient over elapsed follow-up time. Tumor size also showed a linear relationship with log hazard over the range of 1 to 30 cm. Hazard ratios for chemotherapy effect profoundly deviated from log-linear (P<0.004), with significantly decreased hazard for death from baseline for patients with >/=90% tumor necrosis (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.52; P<0.0001). Important implications of these results include: (1) >/=90% tumor necrosis defines good chemotherapy response in a clinically useful manner; (2) staging osteosarcoma by dichotomizing tumor size is inappropriate; and (3) patient age can be modeled as a linear effect on the log hazard ratio in prognostic models with the caveat that risk may change over duration of the analysis.",

DESIGN: Household food security scores measured by the eighteen-item US Household Food Security Survey Module in a longitudinal randomized and controlled SNAP-Ed intervention study conducted from August 2013 to April 2015 were the response variable. Metrics to quantify environmental factors including classification of urban or rural county status; the number of SNAP-authorized stores, food pantries and recreational facilities; average fair market housing rental price; and natural amenity rank were collected from government websites and data sets covering the years 2012-2016 and used as covariates in mixed multiple linear regression modelling. SETTING: Thirty-seven Indiana counties, USA, 2012-2016. SUBJECTS: SNAP-Ed eligible adults from households with children (n 328). RESULTS: None of the environmental factors investigated were significantly associated with changes in household food security in this exploratory study. CONCLUSIONS: SNAP-Ed improves food security regardless of urban or rural location or the environmental factors investigated. Expansion of SNAP-Ed in rural areas may support food access among the low-income population and reduce the prevalence of food insecurity in rural compared with urban areas. Further investigation into policy, systems and environmental factors of the Social Ecological Model are warranted to better understand their relationship with direct SNAP-Ed and their impact on diet-related behaviours and food security.",

        "abstract": "Integrated assessment models (IAMs) hold great potential to assess how future agricultural systems will be shaped by socioeconomic development, technological innovation, and changing climate conditions. By coupling with climate and crop model emulators, IAMs have the potential to resolve important agricultural feedback loops and identify unintended consequences of socioeconomic development for agricultural systems. Here we propose a framework to develop robust representation of agricultural system responses within IAMs, linking downstream applications with model development and the coordinated evaluation of key climate responses from local to global scales. We survey the strengths and weaknesses of protocol-based assessments linked to the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), each utilizing multiple sites and models to evaluate crop response to core climate changes including shifts in carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and water availability, with some studies further exploring how climate responses are affected by nitrogen levels and adaptation in farm systems. Site-based studies with carefully calibrated models encompass the largest number of activities; however they are limited in their ability to capture the full range of global agricultural system diversity. Representative site networks provide more targeted response information than broadly-sampled networks, with limitations stemming from difficulties in covering the diversity of farming systems. Global gridded crop models provide comprehensive coverage, although with large challenges for calibration and quality control of inputs. Diversity in climate responses underscores that crop model emulators must distinguish between regions and farming system while recognizing model uncertainty. Finally, to bridge the gap between bottom-up and top-down approaches we recommend the deployment of a hybrid climate response system employing a representative network of sites to bias-correct comprehensive gridded simulations, opening the door to accelerated development and a broad range of applications.",

        "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the bipolar disorder is one of the ten costliest and most incapacitating diseases in the world. Management of this pathology usually involves a psychiatric follow-up at a pace adapted to the thymic state, and the initiating of a mood-stabilizing treatment. However, what will become of patients with bipolar disorder remains unsatisfying. Psychosocial impacts, increased by often present physical and psychological comorbidities are important (Bonnin et al., 2010) and can be incapacitating: socioprofessional deintegration, social withdrawal, family-related repercussions, low socioeconomic status, lesser quality of life. A functional impairment is found in acute decompensation phases, but also in intercritical periods where different factors might be involved: thymic or cognitive residual symptomatology, as episode consequences, presence of comorbidities...Actually, in this stage of the disease, 30% of bipolar patients present cognitive impairments, that neuropsychological testing can objectify (Gualtieri and Morgan, 2008). Almost 2 thirds present subjective cognitive complaints (Martinez-Aran et al., 2005) that are negatively correlated with quality of life. Among these impairments, harm to working memory is reported in several studies (Bora et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2006), and seems to play a leading role in functional impairment. Managing cognitive impairments seems an important issue to improve patient functioning, quality of life and disorder stability. However, cognitive remediation techniques, largely developed for patients with schizophrenia, remain limited in bipolar disorder, in spite of the great impact of cognitive impairments in this disorder. This objective of this article was an update on bipolar patient neuropsychological profile in an intercritical period, while putting forward working memory critical role in functional impairment. We will also discuss current therapeutic advances allowing to manage these impairments and improve patient functioning.",

Many rounds of the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycles may be required before an engineered strain meeting specific metrics required for industrial application. The bioindustry prefer products in secreted form (secreted products or extracellular metabolites) as it can lower the cost of downstream processing, reduce metabolic burden to cell hosts, and allow necessary modification on the final products , such as biopharmaceuticals. Yet, products in secreted form result in the disconnection of phenotype from genotype, which may have limited throughput in the Test step for identification of desired variants from large libraries of mutant strains. In droplet microfluidic screening, single cells are encapsulated in individual droplet and enable high-throughput processing and sorting of single cells or clones. Encapsulation in droplets allows this technology to overcome the throughput limitations present in traditional methods for screening by extracellular phenotypes. In this chapter, we describe a protocol/guideline for high-throughput droplet microfluidics screening of yeast libraries for higher protein secretion . This protocol can be adapted to screening by a range of other extracellular products from yeast or other hosts.",

        "abstract": "The efficiency of the musculoskeletal system of broiler chickens, in particular during locomotion and in ensuring its supportive function, depends directly on the adequate function and mechanical endurance of soft tissues, including tendons. However, little is known whether the properties of musculoskeletal soft tissues can be influenced by changes of dietary protein. We substituted soybean meal with raw chickpea seeds as the primary protein source in the diet and studied the effects it had on the mechanical and thermal properties of drumstick tendons in broiler Ross 308 chickens. In the experiment, 160 chicks were divided into 2 groups, receiving in their diet either soybean meal (n = 80) or chickpea seeds (n = 80). The experiment lasted 42 days. The physical condition of the drumstick tendons was analyzed on the basis of a tensile test and the results of thermal denaturation as measured by a differential scanning calorimetry. The mechanical evaluation of tendon tensile strength of the broilers fed with chickpea seeds demonstrated an increase in the ultimate strain (for over 22%, P < 0.04) and total energy absorbed by the tendon until rupture (for over 57%, P < 0.05) as when compared to the group fed with soybean meal. Thermal analysis demonstrated alterations in tendon collagen cross-linking as transition onset temperature decreased (from 63.8 to 61.8 degrees C, P < 0.001), whereas the calorimetric enthalpy increased (from 16.2 to 22.1 J\u22c5g-1, P < 0.05) in the group fed with chickpea seeds. In summary, this study demonstrated that dietary protein source can impact the physical properties of tendons and showed that thermal analysis can be a useful tool for studying the effect of nutrition on the development and structural changes in tendons of broiler chickens.",

The amino acid sequence of Aa-cp100k was shown a high similarity to other three barnacles including Megabalanus rosa (Mr-cp100k), Tetraclita japonica formosana (Tj-cp100k) and Pollicipes pollicipes (Pp-cp100k). Moreover, the localization of Aa-cp100k in the vacuoles of cyprid beta secretory cells and the adult cement gland cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, indicating that Aa-cp100k existed in both cyprid and adult barnacle. Aa-cp100k from basal plate could be dissolved in urea buffer without high concentration of dithiothreitol (DTT), different from that in Megabalanus rosa, implying diverse possible roles of cp100k in cementing.",

        "abstract": "The epididymis is a male reproductive organ involved in posttesticular sperm maturation and storage, but the mechanism underlying sperm maturation remains unclear. beta-Defensins (Defbs) belong to a family of small, cysteine-rich, cationic peptides that are antimicrobial and modulate the immune response. A large number of Defb genes are expressed abundantly in the male reproductive tract, especially in the epididymis. We and other groups have shown the involvement of several Defb genes in regulation of sperm function. In this study, we found that Defb23, Defb26, and Defb42 were highly expressed in specific regions of the epididymis. Rats with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-gene disruption of Defb23, Defb26, or Defb42 had no obvious fertility phenotypes. Those with the deletion of Defb23/ 26 or Defb23/ 26/ 42 became subfertile, and sperm isolated from the epididymal cauda of multiple-mutant rats were demonstrated decreased motility. Meanwhile, the sperm showed precocious capacitation and increased spontaneous acrosome reaction. Consistent with premature capacitation and acrosome reaction, sperm from multiple-gene-knockout rats had significantly increased intracellular calcium. These results suggest that Defb family members affect sperm maturation by a synergistic pattern in the epididymis.-Zhang, C., Zhou, Y., Xie, S., Yin, Q., Tang, C., Ni, Z., Fei, J., Zhang, Y.

        "abstract": "Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors of late-onset severe pneumonia (LOSP) in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Methods: From January 2009 to December 2015, 68 patients with LOSP after allo-HSCT at Peking University Institute of Hematology were enrolled. In this retrospective study, univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic factors for LOSP after allo-HSCT. Results: The median time from allo-HSCT to the development of LOSP was 213 (90-2 330) days. The overall survival rate was 42.6% (29/68). The median survival time from LOSP to death was 21 days. Early mortality was defined as death within 21 days after LOSP, as late death more than or equal to 21 days. The median oxygenation index was 199.15 (92.21-290.48) mmHg. LOSPs in thirty-two patients (36.8%) were caused by virus, bacteria, fungi or mixed pathogens. The median C-reactive protein (CRP) was 75.65 (0.94-451.00) mg/L. The median procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.66 (0.00-249.00) mug/L. The higher PCT value indicated an early higher mortality rate by the ROC curve (PCT: cut-off >/=0.94 mug/L). Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggested that PCT more than or equal to 0.94 mug/L was a risk factor for early death of LOSP (OR=5.77, 95%CI 1.66-20.11, P=0.006). LOSP occurred later or equal to 213 days after allo-HSCT was also a risk factor of early death in LOSP (OR=4.74, 95%CI 1.33-16.89, P=0.017). No previous history of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) (OR=4.50, 95%CI 1.58-12.83, P=0.005) and LOSP later or equal to 213 days (OR=4.40, 95%CI 1.61-11.99, P=0.004) were the risk factors of late death in LOSP. Conclusions: PCT more than or equal to 0.94 mug/L and LOSP later or equal to 213 days are the risk factors of early death in LOSP. No previous chronic GVHD and LOSP later or equal to 213 days are the risk factors of late death in LOSP.",

        "abstract": "In this research work, an efficient, facile, prompt, and relatively safe enrichment procedure, named as air agitated-emulsification microextraction based on a low density-deep eutectic solvent (AA-EME-LD-DES), was applied for the first time to separate trace amounts of the drugs escitalopram, desipramine, and imipramine from complex sample solutions. This bio-degradable and cheap choline chloride-based extracting agent was readily prepared by the easy blending process at the ambient temperature, resulting in a eutectic liquid mixture with distinct features. Also the subsequent usage of an effective proceeding of the current microextraction procedure without a vital requirement for a further purification was adopted as another impressive benefit. Investigation of the main parameters influencing the multivariate technique based on the central composite design (CCD) combined with the desirability function (DF) revealed that pH12.0, 200muL of the extraction solvent, 430muL of the emulsifier solvent, and 14 air agitation cycles led to maximum extraction efficiencies with the DF value close to 0.97. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the wide linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) of 10.0-5000, 15.0-8000, and 15.0-6000ngmL(-1) for escitalopram, desipramine, and imipramine were accurately obtainable, respectively, with the determination coefficients (R(2)s) higher than 0.98 and the low limits of detection (LODs) of 3.0-4.5ngmL(-1). The percent extraction recoveries and enrichment factors were found to be adequately quantitative in the spans of 42-68% and 25-40, respectively, possessing good relative standard deviations (%RSDs, n=3) in the range of 3.6-5.7%. Finally, accurate analyses at therapeutically low ranges for the human plasma sample and trace levels for the pharmaceutical wastewater sample were successfully obtained, certifying the appropriate pre-concentration and enrichment capabilities of the proposed microextraction approach.",

Previously, we demonstrated that glypican-3 (GPC3) is highly expressed in HCC, and that GPC3 induces oncogenicity and promotes the growth of cancer cells through IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of GPC3-mediated enhancement of IGF-1R signaling. We demonstrated that GPC3 decreased IGF-1-induced IGF-1R ubiquitination and degradation and increased c-Myc protein levels. GPC3 bound to Grb10, a mediator of ligand-induced receptor ubiquitination, and the overexpression of Grb10 blocked GPC3-enhanced IGF-1-induced ERK phosphorylation. GPC3 promoted the growth of NIH3T3 and PLC-PRF-5 cells in serum-free medium but did not promote the growth of IGF-1R negative R- cells. Grb10 overexpression decreased GPC3-promoted cell growth. Therefore, the present study elucidates the mechanisms of GPC3-induced oncogenicity, which may highlight new strategies for the treatment of HCC.",

Children (n = 101, ages 5-16), predominantly African American, were recruited into this cross sectional study using ethnographic mapping and targeted sampling for high-risk neighborhoods. Mothers reported retrospectively on their own exposure to physical maltreatment in childhood, their parenting practices, as well as current depressive symptoms. Maternal report of her child's exposure to stressful life events and child behavior was also collected. Maternal childhood exposure to physical maltreatment was significantly associated with her child's internalizing symptoms (p = .004); this effect remained after accounting for child sex, maternal depressive symptoms, harsh parenting practices, and the child's own exposure to stressful life events. Formal tests of mediation through these pathways were non-significant. Findings suggest mothers' experience of childhood maltreatment contributes uniquely to children's internalizing symptoms, potentially through previously uncharacterized pathways. Examination of additional behavioral, psychosocial and biological pathways may help better describe the multi-generational effects of child maltreatment.",

Here we test the relationship between three theoretically dissociable dimensions of thought: freedom of movement in thought, task-relatedness, and perceptual decoupling (i.e., lack of awareness of surroundings). Using everyday life experience sampling, thought probes were randomly delivered to participants' phones for ten days. Results revealed weak intra-individual correlations between freedom of movement in thought and task-unrelatedness, as well as perceptual decoupling. Within our dataset, over 40% of thoughts would have been misclassified under the assumption that off-task thought is inherently freely moving. Overall, freedom of movement appears to be an independent dimension of thought that is not captured by the two most common measures of mind wandering. Future work focusing on the dynamics of thought may be crucial for improving our understanding of the wandering mind.",

They were restored with standardized CAD-CAM lithium disilicate reinforced ceramic restorations (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar-Vivadent) and divided into four Groups (n=12): overlays (Group A, no endo-core, negative control), endocrowns with an endo-core of 2mm (Group B), 4mm (GroupC) and crowns with post and core (Group D, positive control). All specimens were first submitted to thermo-mechanical cyclic loading (TCML)(1.7Hz, 49N, 600000 cycles, 1500 thermo-cycles). Margins were analysed before and after the loading. Survived specimens were then submitted to cyclic isometric stepwise loading (5Hz, 200N to 1200N) until completion of 105000 cycles or failure. In case of fracture, fragments were analysed using SEM and failure mode was determined. Results of stepwise loading were statistically analysed by Kaplan-Meier life survival analysis and log rank test (p=0.05). RESULTS: All the specimens survived the TCML test except four specimens of Group A (early restorations' debonding). No difference in percentages of closed margins was found between endocrowns (Groups B, C) and crowns (Group D). After the stepwise test, differences in survival within the groups were not statistically significant. Most of restorations experienced non-reparable fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Endocrowns with both 2-mm and 4-mm long endo-cores displayed outcomes after fatigue equivalent to classical crowns. Results of this study discourage the use of flat overlays with only adhesive retention. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When restoring extremely destroyed devitalized premolars, adhesive strategies should be coupled to a macro-mechanical retention in the root.",

Few receive comprehensive inpatient addiction treatment (CIAT) after the initial emergency management. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare 6-month outcomes of treatment in alcohol-dependence syndrome (ADS) patients presenting with DT receiving either only emergency care or emergency care along with CIAT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, all patients of ADS presenting in DT over a 1-year period were followed up for 6 months. Patients who received care only in the emergency services (ES) (111) were compared with patients who received ES followed by CIAT (90). Primary followup measure was regular followup (RFU) at outpatient department, and patients not presenting for RFU received telephonic followup (TFU). Alcohol use status was monitored at 6 months, as per Feuerlein and Kufner criteria. RESULTS: Patients who received both ES and CIAT had better RFU compared to patients treated in the ES alone at 6 months (71/90 vs. 17/111, respectively, P < 0.005). CIAT also resulted in better combined follow-up (RFU and TFU) (85/90 vs. 60/111, respectively, P < 0.005). Compared to ES treatment group alone, ES plus CIAT group had fewer relapses (41/85 vs. 42/60, respectively, P < 0.05). The most common reason for direct discharge from ES was nonavailability of beds for inpatient treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Merely emergency treatment of ADS patients presenting with DT does not provide satisfactory treatment outcome with respect to alcohol use. ES treatment followed by CIAT ensures better outcome in the form of fewer relapses and better follow up.",

        "abstract": "Thiol-dependent redox regulation allows the rapid adaptation of chloroplast function to unpredictable changes in light intensity. Traditionally, it has been considered that chloroplast redox regulation relies on photosynthetically reduced ferredoxin (Fd), thioredoxins (Trxs), and an Fd-dependent Trx reductase (FTR), the Fd-FTR-Trxs system, which links redox regulation to light. More recently, a plastid-localized NADPH-dependent Trx reductase (NTR) with a joint Trx domain, termed NTRC, was identified. NTRC efficiently reduces 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs), thus having antioxidant function, but also participates in redox regulation of metabolic pathways previously established to be regulated by Trxs. Thus, the NTRC, 2-Cys Prxs, and Fd-FTR-Trxs redox systems may act concertedly, but the nature of the relationship between them is unknown. Here we show that decreased levels of 2-Cys Prxs suppress the phenotype of the Arabidopsis thaliana ntrc KO mutant. The excess of oxidized 2-Cys Prxs in NTRC-deficient plants drains reducing power from chloroplast Trxs, which results in low efficiency of light energy utilization and impaired redox regulation of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes. Moreover, the dramatic phenotype of the ntrc-trxf1f2 triple mutant, lacking NTRC and f-type Trxs, was also suppressed by decreased 2-Cys Prxs contents, as the ntrc-trxf1f2-Delta2cp mutant partially recovered the efficiency of light energy utilization and exhibited WT rate of CO(2) fixation and growth phenotype. The suppressor phenotype was not caused by compensatory effects of additional chloroplast antioxidant systems. It is proposed that the Fd-FTR-Trx and NTRC redox systems are linked by the redox balance of 2-Cys Prxs, which is crucial for chloroplast function.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and deadly disease, for which effective medical treatments are lacking. Here, we investigated whether 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin (DHM) could prevent monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH in rats. The MCT-injected rats were treated with normal saline or DHM (100mg/kg body weight/d) for 4 weeks, followed by measurements of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI), pulmonary arterial remodeling (PAR), and expression levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. In vitro, we assessed the role of DHM on IL-6-induced migration of primary human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs). We found that DHM treatment attenuated changes in RVSP, RVHI, and PAR in MCT-injected PAH rats. The observed increase of IL-6 levels in PAH rats was inhibited by DHM treatment. In vitro, DHM pretreatment reduced IL-6-induced HPASMC migration. Furthermore, MCT- and IL-6-mediated increases in MMP9 and P-STAT3 (tyr705) PY-STAT3 levels were suppressed by DHM treatment in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that DHM could prevent MCT-induced rat PAH and IL-6-induced HPASMC migration through a mechanism involving inhibiting of the STAT3/MMP9 axis.",

The XRD varphi-scan studies reveal the single crystalline nature of both bilayered composites, with parallel epitaxial growth of LMO and LCMO layers onto the LAO substrate. The valence states of Mn ions in both layers of both composites were identified by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The I-V characteristics of the LMO/LCMO interfaces show strong backward diode-like behavior at higher applied voltages well above the crossover voltage (V(NB)). Below V(NB), the interfaces demonstrate normal diode-like characteristics throughout the studied temperature range. The electric field-induced modulation of the LMO/LCMO junction resistance of the interfaces has been observed. Electric field-dependent electroresistance (ER) modifications at different temperatures have also been studied. The electrical transport properties have been discussed in the context of various mechanisms, such as charge injection, tunneling, depletion region modification and thermal processes across the interface. The effects of structurally and chemically developed sharp interfaces between the LMO and LCMO layers on the transport properties of the presently studied bilayered thin film composites have been discussed on the basis of correlation between the physicochemical characterization and charge transport behavior. A comparison of different aspects of the transport properties has been presented in the context of the structural strain and crystallinity of the composites grown using both wet and dry chemical techniques.",

The nearcritical water treatment efficiently depolymerized cellulose, producing a solid precipitated fraction of low-molecular-weight material containing cellulose II, while homogenization mechanically deconstructed MCC without altering its molecular structure. Both pathways yielded nanocellulose-like materials yet with different morphologies. The mechanically produced, rod-like particles were obtained with high yield. In contrast, the hydrothermal precipitate exhibited more hydrophobic ribbon-like particles that provided a greater level of particle-particle interaction. Both materials successfully acted as stabilizers for oil-in-water Pickering emulsions; however, the hydrothermally-produced material exhibited superior performance, with stable emulsions obtained upon addition of as low as 1.0wt.% cellulose. These two pathways are highly relevant for altering the structure and properties of MCC and for formulating new, sustainably produced nanocellulose-based materials.",

Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a highly effective prevention strategy federally approved since 2012, could fundamentally alter the course of the epidemic. However, PrEP's potential has not been fully realized, in part because health care providers have been slow to adopt PrEP in clinical practice and have been selective in their discussion of PrEP with patients. This nonstandardized approach has constrained PrEP access. PrEP access has not only been inadequate but also inequitable, with several groups in high need showing lower rates of uptake than do their socially privileged counterparts. Recognizing these early warning signs that current approaches to PrEP implementation could exacerbate existing HIV disparities, we call on health professionals to integrate PrEP into routine preventive health care for adult patients-particularly in primary care, reproductive health, and behavioral health settings. Drawing on the empirical literature, we present 4 arguments for why doing so would improve access and access equity, and we conclude that the benefits clearly outweigh the challenges.",

The present study demonstrated that treatment of isolated mouse liver mitochondria with the synthesized HCV p7 protein induced mitochondrial dysfunction. It also demonstrated that HCV p7 targeted isolated mouse liver mitochondria and induced mitochondrial depolarization. In addition, HCV p7 triggered matrix acidification and, ultimately, a decrease in ATP synthesis in isolated mitochondria. These findings indicate that targeting of mitochondria by HCV p7 in infected cells causes mitochondrial dysfunction to support HCV particle production. The present study provided evidence for the role of HCV p7 in mitochondria, and may lead to the development of novel strategies for HCV therapy.",

        "abstract": "Though the importance of sustainable employability throughout people's working life is undisputed, up till now only one attempt for a conceptual definition has been made (van der Klink et al., 2016). Following the suggestions to further refine and improve this definition recently put forward by Fleuren et al. (2016), we propose an approach to sustainable employability that is based on the Ability-Motivation-Opportunity (AMO) framework, and incorporates three indicators: the ability, the motivation, and the opportunity to continue working, respectively. As sustainable employability is considered to be an important aspect of successful aging at work, this study used four different conceptualizations of aging at work to set up convergent and divergent validity of our operationalization of sustainable employability: calendar age, organizational age (job and organizational tenure), functional age (work ability), and life-span age (partner and children). We formulated several hypotheses that were tested by analyzing data from an online survey among 180 employees from Dutch public service organizations who filled out a questionnaire on different age concepts, and their ability, motivation, and opportunity to continue working. Multiple regression analyses were performed, and results showed that the four conceptualizations of aging were differently related to the three indicators of sustainable employability. Life-span age, in terms of having children, had the strongest negative relationship with the ability to continue working, organizational age (i.e., organizational tenure) had the strongest negative relationship with the motivation to continue working, and functional age had the strongest negative relationship with the opportunity to continue working. Moreover, functional age was significantly negatively related to the other two indicators of sustainable employability too, while life-span age appeared to enhance the ability and motivation to continue working (in terms of having children) and the perceived opportunity to continue working (in terms of having a partner). Calendar age was only important for the opportunity to continue working and appeared to have a negative association with this outcome variable. These results lend support to our proposed operationalization of sustainable employability by showing that the three indicators are differently related to different age conceptualizations thus expanding previous research on the conceptualization of sustainable employability.",

Although the virus neutralization test is the gold standard assay for MERS diagnosis and for investigating the zoonotic reservoir, it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories. Competitive ELISA (cELISA), in which a labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes, may be a suitable alternative because it detects antibodies in a species-independent manner. In this study, novel MAbs against the spike protein of MERS-CoV were produced and characterized. One of these MAbs was used to develop a cELISA. The cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in sera from MERS-CoV-infected rats and rabbits immunized with the spike protein of MERS-CoV. The MAb-based cELISA was validated using sera from Ethiopian dromedary camels. Relative to the neutralization test, the cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in 66 Ethiopian dromedary camels with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. The cELISA and neutralization test results correlated well (Pearson's correlation coefficients=0.71-0.76, depending on the cELISA serum dilution). This cELISA may be useful for MERS epidemiological investigations on MERS-CoV infection.",

However, the data were inconsistent. In this article, we conducted a systematic review for the researches related to the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTNNB1 with overall cancer risk. Meanwhile, a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to select articles for quantitative analysis. Consequently, eight case-control studies containing 4388 cases and 4477 controls were included in a meta-analysis of four highly studied CTNNB1 SNPs (rs1798802 A/G, rs4135385 A/G, rs11564475 A/G, and rs2293303 C/T). The association between each SNP and cancer risk was estimated by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). The results showed rs1798802 (AA compared with GG: P=0.044, OR=0.72) and rs2293303 (TT compared with CC: P=0.002, OR=2.86; recessive model: P=0.006, OR=2.91; T compared with C: P=0.004, OR=1.19) polymorphisms were associated with overall cancer risk. In stratified analysis, rs4135385 polymorphism was found to elevate the risk in Caucasian or in gastrointestinal cancer subgroup. Additionally, rs2293303 conferred to an increased cancer risk when the source of control groups was hospital-based (HB). In conclusion, the three CTNNB1 SNPs were suggested to have the potential to be novel biomarkers for risk prediction of cancer in overall population or some specific subgroups. Our study could provide research clues for further related investigations.",

The cells of the two strains were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic and non-motile short rods that multiplied by binary division. Strains 4G-K17(T) and 4G-K15 were obligately acidophilic, mesophilic bacteria capable of growth at pH 3.0-7.0 (optimum 4.0-5.5 and 3.5-5.5, respectively), temperature 12-42  degrees C (optimum 28  degrees C) and NaCl concentrations from 0~2.5 % and 0~3.0 % (w/v), respectively. They had a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 99.2 % and showed the highest similarities of 97.1 and 97.4 % to Edaphobacter aggregans Wbg-1(T), respectively, which indicated that these two isolates belonged to a novel species of the genus Edaphobacter in subdivision 1 in the family Acidobacteriaceae. The DNA G+C contents of strains 4G-K17(T) and 4G-K15 were 57.6 and 57.2 %, respectively. They had similar fatty acid profiles, with the major (>10 %) fatty acid profile comprising iso-C15 : 0, C16 : 0 and summed feature 3 (iso-C16 : 1omega7c and/or C16 : 1omega6c), and the major polar lipid profile comprising phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, unidentified aminophospholipids and unidentified phospholipids. All physiological, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic data suggest that strains 4G-K17(T) and 4G-K15 belong to a new species of the genus Edaphobacter, for which the name Edaphobacter acidisoli sp. nov. is proposed, with 4G-K17(T) (=CGMCC 1.15447=LMG 29212) as the type strain.",

Dissociation ratings were increased by ketamine in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, midazolam showed no effect on ratings of dissociation. For individual CADSS items, the magnitude of change and the ketamine dose at which changes were observed were not homogenous. The Cronbach alpha for the total scale was high (0.937), with acceptable item-rest correlations for almost all individual items. Purposefully removing items to maximise alpha did not lead to meaningful improvements. Acceptable internal consistency was still observed after removing items which lacked evidence of responsiveness at lower doses. The high Cronbach alpha values identified in this study suggests that the CADSS is an internally consistent instrument for evaluating ketamine-induced dissociation in clinical trials in anxiety, although it does not capture symptoms such as thought disorder.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a significantly high rate of work-related musculsokeletal injuries in sonography professionals. To date, assessment of risk factors for work- related injuries in sonographers has been based primarily on surveys, subjective reports, and observational methods. There is a need to develop quantitative techniques to better understand risk factors and develop preventive interventions. OBJECTIVE: We pilot tested a high-resolution force-measuring probe capable of precisely measuring forces applied through the transducer by sonographers and used this novel direct measurement technique to evaluate forces during abdominal imaging. METHODS: Twelve sonographers with varied experience, ranging from 1-33 years, performed routine abdominal scans on 10 healthy volunteers who had varied body mass indices (BMI). Imaging was conducted using the force-measuring probe, which provided real-time measurement of forces, and angles. Data were compared by sonographer years of experience and subject BMI. RESULTS: In total, 47 abdominal examinations were performed as part of this study, and all images met standards for clinical diagnostic quality. The mean contact force applied across all exams was 8.2+/-4.3 Newtons (N) (range: 1.2-36.5 N). For subjects in the high BMI group (BMI>25, n = 4) the mean force was 10.5 N (range: 8.9-13.2 N) compared to 7.9 N (range: 5.9-10.9 N) for subjects with normal BMI (BMI = 18.5-25, n = 6). Similarly, the mean maximum force applied for subjects with high BMI (25.3 N) was significantly higher than force applied for subjects with normal BMI (17.4 N). No significant difference was noted in the amount of force applied by sonographers with more than 5 years of experience (n = 6) at 8.2 N (Range: 5.1-10.0 N) compared to less experienced sonographers (n = 6), whose forces averaged 8.1 N (Range: 5.8-10.0 N). CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to directly measure forces applied by sonographers using a high-resolution force measurement system. Forces applied during abdominal imaging vary widely, are significantly higher when scanning subjects with high BMI, and are not related to sonographer years of experience. This force measurement system has the potential to provide an additional quantitative data point to explore the impact of applied forces on sonographer related musculoskeletal injury, particularly in conjunction with various body positions, exam types and force durations.",

Therefore, an improved REILP model is proposed. This model adds an equity objective function and three constraint conditions to overcome this equity problem. In this case, pollution reduction is in proportion to pollutant load, which supports balanced development between different regional economies. The model is used to solve the problem of pollution load allocation in a small transboundary watershed. Compared with the REILP original model result, our model achieves equity between the upstream and downstream pollutant loads; it also overcomes the problem of greatest pollution reduction, where sources are nearest to the control section. The model provides a better solution to the problem of pollution load allocation than previous versions.",

Proangiogenic factors are potential endothelial stimulators, and their disturbances can link abnormalities of endothelium with increased risk of vascular disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of circulating proangiogenic factors in sera of migraineurs during interictal period. Fifty-two patients aged 37.9 +/- 9.6 years, fulfilling International Headache Society criteria for migraine, were included in this observational case-control study. The control group included 39 healthy volunteers, matched according to age and gender. All subjects underwent full neurological examination and clinimetric evaluation with the use of: MIDAS, MIGSEV, QVM, VAS and VRS scales. Serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenin, angiopoietin-2, thrombopoietin and Tie-2 were estimated in migraineurs and in the control group with the use of ELISA. In migraineurs during interictal period, we have found decreased serum VEGF and angiogenin concentrations compared with controls. Age of migraine onset correlated with VEGF, angiopoietin-2 and thrombopoietin concentrations. Furthermore, angiopoietin-2 level correlated with QVM score and Tie-2 with pain intensity evaluated using MIGSEV scale. In migraine patients during interictal period, depletion of VEGF and angiogenin, two cooperating proangiogenic factors, can be responsible for endothelial dysfunction and increased risk for vascular disorders.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Intestinal Lipomatosis consists of diffuse lipomas in various regions from the small to large bowel. They can remain asymptomatic or present with complications such as Intussusception. DISCUSSION: Intestinal lipomatosis complicated by Intussusception is a rare occurrence that has not been well documented. Rare condition management is difficult to approach because of the customizability each scenario requires. We hope through sharing our approach this can serve as a rough template to physicians who find themselves in a similar scenario. Overtime, as more case reports and surgical approaches are recorded we can establish future advancements in surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of a 47 year-old male who arrived at the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. A CT scan revealed ileocolic intussusception. An intramural lipoma of the terminal ileum served as the lead point. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the Intussusception and a right hemicolectomy was performed to repair the affected area. Examination of the resected large bowel showed diffuse thickening of the mucosa in the area of the cecum confirmed to be submucosal lipomatosis on histological examination. Patient was discharged on the fifth post-operative day. CONCLUSION: This case confirmed previous treatment modalities in the management of intussusception. It also corroborates the complication of intussusception with Intestinal lipomatosis. It teaches us the importance of keeping a wide differential when considering a diagnosis of bowel obstruction. Through imaging, surgical exploration, and pathological interpretation, this case, which began as a complaint of abdominal pain, concluded as a rare clinical entity.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework and associated software toolbox for mapping population receptive fields (pRFs) based on fMRI data. This generic approach is intended to work with stimuli of any dimension and is demonstrated and validated in the context of 2D retinotopic mapping. The framework enables the experimenter to specify generative (encoding) models of fMRI timeseries, in which experimental stimuli enter a pRF model of neural activity, which in turns drives a nonlinear model of neurovascular coupling and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response. The neuronal and haemodynamic parameters are estimated together on a voxel-by-voxel or region-of-interest basis using a Bayesian estimation algorithm (variational Laplace). This offers several novel contributions to receptive field modelling. The variance/covariance of parameters are estimated, enabling receptive fields to be plotted while properly representing uncertainty about pRF size and location. Variability in the haemodynamic response across the brain is accounted for. Furthermore, the framework introduces formal hypothesis testing to pRF analysis, enabling competing models to be evaluated based on their log model evidence (approximated by the variational free energy), which represents the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Using simulations and empirical data, we found that parameters typically used to represent pRF size and neuronal scaling are strongly correlated, which is taken into account by the Bayesian methods we describe when making inferences. We used the framework to compare the evidence for six variants of pRF model using 7 T functional MRI data and we found a circular Difference of Gaussians (DoG) model to be the best explanation for our data overall. We hope this framework will prove useful for mapping stimulus spaces with any number of dimensions onto the anatomy of the brain.",

Eleven trials with a total of 765 patients were included. The pooled correlation was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.74) between two-dimensional (2D) GLS and the LGE percentage, and it was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.78) for three-dimensional (3D) GLS. Pooled diagnostic estimates for 2D GLS to differentiate an MI size >12% were as follows: sensitivity, 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.90); specificity, 0.86 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.96); positive likelihood ratio (PLR), 8.13 (95% CI: 1.90, 26.61); negative likelihood ratio (NLR), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.54); and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), 39.87 (95% CI: 4.12, 172.83). The estimated area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.702. The 2D STE results positively correlated with the infarction size quantified by CMR for patients who had experienced their first MI. This approach can serve as a good diagnostic index for assessing infarction area. However, more consolidated STE studies are still needed to determine the value of 3D STE.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recent public reporting initiatives in England highlight general practice variation in indicators of diagnostic activity related to cancer. We aimed to quantify the size and sources of variation and the reliability of practice-level estimates of such indicators, to better inform how this information is interpreted and used for quality improvement purposes. DESIGN: Ecological cross-sectional study. SETTING: English primary care. PARTICIPANTS: All general practices in England with at least 1000 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sixteen diagnostic activity indicators from the Cancer Services Public Health Profiles. RESULTS: Mixed-effects logistic and Poisson regression showed that substantial proportions of the observed variance in practice scores reflected chance, variably so for different indicators (between 7% and 85%). However, after accounting for the role of chance, there remained substantial variation between practices (typically up to twofold variation between the 75th and 25th centiles of practice scores, and up to fourfold variation between the 90th and 10th centiles). The age and sex profile of practice populations explained some of this variation, by different amounts across indicators. Generally, the reliability of diagnostic process indicators relating to broader populations of patients most of whom do not have cancer (eg, rate of endoscopic investigations, or urgent referrals for suspected cancer (also known as 'two week wait referrals')) was high (>/=0.80) or very high (>/=0.90). In contrast, the reliability of diagnostic outcome indicators relating to incident cancer cases (eg, per cent of all cancer cases detected after an emergency presentation) ranged from 0.24 to 0.54, which is well below recommended thresholds (>/=0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Use of indicators of diagnostic activity in individual general practices should principally focus on process indicators which have adequate or high reliability and not outcome indicators which are unreliable at practice level.",

MATERIALS & METHODS: Male albino Wistar rats were divided randomly into five groups of twenty-one rats each, and given the following treatments for 10 days: (1) no ligature + water, (2) ligature + water, (3) ligature + 50 mg/kg Met, (4) ligature + 100 mg/kg Met, and (5) ligature + 200 mg/kg Met. Water or Met was administered orally. Maxillae were fixed and scanned using Micro-computed Tomography (muCT) to quantitate linear and bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) volumetric bone loss. Histopathological characteristics were assessed through immunohistochemical staining for MMP-9, COX-2, the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway, SOD-1, and GPx-1. Additionally, confocal microscopy was used to analyze osteocalcin fluorescence. UV-VIS analysis was used to examine the levels of malondialdehyde, glutathione, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha from gingival tissues. Quantitative RT-PCR reaction was used to gene expression of AMPK, NF-kappaB (p65), and Hmgb1 from gingival tissues. Significance among groups were analysed using a one-way ANOVA. A p-value of p<0.05 indicated a significant difference. RESULTS: Treatment with 50 mg/kg Met significantly reduced concentrations of malondialdehyde, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05). Additionally, weak staining was observed for COX-2, MMP-9, RANK, RANKL, SOD-1, and GPx-1 after 50 mg/kg Met. OPG and Osteocalcin showed strong staining in the same group. Radiographically, linear measurements showed a statistically significant reduction in bone loss after 50 mg/kg Met compared to the ligature and Met 200 mg/kg groups. The same pattern was observed volumetrically in BV/TV and decreased osteoclast number (p<0.05). RT-PCR showed increased AMPK expression and decreased expression of NF-kappaB (p65) and HMGB1 after 50 mg/kg Met. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin, at a concentration of 50 mg/kg, decreases the inflammatory response, oxidative stress and bone loss in ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although delivery of drugs from pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) via spacer devices is widespread it cannot be assumed that patients take their medication as prescribed or use their spacer appropriately. We developed a Spacer Data Logger device to record patient adherence and whether patients had shaken the pMDI, actuated it soon after shaking, and inhaled a sufficient volume from it. METHODS: We report an assessment of the Spacer Data Logger to measure and record that the pMDI was adequately shaken, the time to actuation, and the volume \"inhaled\" from the spacer up to 26 seconds after actuation. The effect of a delay in actuation following shaking on the dose available for inhalation from the spacer and the effect of a delay in extraction of aerosol from the spacer were assessed using different strengths of beclomethasone dipropionate (50 and 100 mug) and fluticasone propionate (50, 125 and 250 mug). RESULTS: The volumes measured by the Spacer Data Logger were in close agreement with the reference volumes of four simulated breathing patterns. A delay between shaking and actuating the pMDI resulted in a significant increase in the dose available for inhalation after only 4 seconds for the 50 and 250 mug strengths of fluticasone propionate pMDIs (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). A delay between actuation of the drug into the spacer and \"inhalation\" of aerosol from the spacer also resulted in a steady decline in the dose available from the spacer (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed the importance of using the pMDI spacer correctly by actuating directly after shaking and inhaling the aerosol from the spacer as soon after actuation as possible to optimize the dose available for inhalation. The Spacer Data Logger should be a useful tool to determine adherence to and \"optimum\" use of pMDI spacers in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the long-term outcomes of implanting intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRSs) to correct central keratoconus with a high corneal asphericity value. METHODS: Forty-three eyes with central keratoconus with a corneal asphericity value >/=-1.00 were evaluated before and after implanting an inferior 210-degree arc-length Ferrara-type AFR5 ICRS (AJL Ophthalmic, Spain). Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution uncorrected (UDVA) and best-corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuity, corneal asphericity, root mean square for coma-like aberrations [computed for the Zernike terms Z (3, 1) and Z (3, -1)], and residual refractive errors analyzed using vector analysis were recorded before and at all follow-up visits. The postoperative follow-up duration was 3 years in all cases. RESULTS: Mean UDVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale) rose from 1.18 +/- 0.59 to a postoperative 0.53 +/- 0.39 after ICRS implantation (P < 0.0001). Mean CDVA varied in turn from 0.36 +/- 0.18 to 0.17 +/- 0.10 (P < 0.0001). CDVA remained unchanged or improved in all eyes after surgery. Both UDVA and CDVA were stable over the postoperative period (P > 0.05). The spherical equivalent declined steeply after ICRS implantation (P < 0.0001). Both spherical equivalent and refractive cylinder were stable over the postoperative period. The corneal asphericity and root mean square values for coma-like aberrations exhibited statistically significant decreases 6 months after ICRS implantation (P < 0.0001) and were also stable over postoperative follow-up (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that implanting a single, inferior, 210-degree arc-length Ferrara-type ICRS is a safe, effective, and stable procedure for treating patients with central hyperprolate keratoconus.",

Children are vulnerable to its health effects, and their greatest exposure occurs at home. OBJECTIVES: To assess airborne nicotine concentration of the living room and children's bedroom of homes with children under 13 years of age, and to analyse factors associated with these levels. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Barcelona in 2015-2016, selecting a convenience sample from families with at least one child under 13 years of age. The sample comprised 50 families with smokers and 50 without. We measured airborne nicotine concentrations in the living room and children's bedroom, and, using a questionnaire administered to the parents, collected information about smoking habits at home. RESULTS: Homes without smokers showed nicotine concentrations below the limit of detection (<0.02 microg/m(3)), while those with at least one smoker showed 0.16 microg/m(3) in the living room and 0.12 microg/m(3) in the bedroom. When smoking was allowed inside home, these values increased to 1.04 and 0.48 microg/m(3), respectively. Moreover, nicotine concentrations in both rooms were strongly correlated (r=0.89), and higher nicotine levels were associated with the number of cigarettes smoked in the living room, smoking rules, the number of smokers living at home and tobacco smell. CONCLUSIONS: Homes with smokers present SHS in the living room and in the children's bedroom. Therefore, programmes focused on reducing children's SHS exposure are urgently needed.",

Fifteen screw-block constructs per group were tested to failure in axial pullout. Axial pullout strength and yield strength were calculated. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The 2.0 mm cortical screws achieved lower axial pullout strength than 2.0 mm cancellous screws in cancellous blocks. The 2.0 mm cortical screws achieved greater pullout strength than 2.0 mm cancellous screws in bicortical blocks. CONCLUSION: The 2.0 mm cancellous screws may offer a biomechanical advantage in bone with thin cortices (<1 mm thick), whereas 2.0 mm cortical screws may be preferred in cortical bone with cortices measuring at least 1 mm in thickness.",

Present study assesses and compares the marital satisfaction and quality of life (QOL) of the patients and their spouses.

In this cross sectional study, 50 patients diagnosed with Depressive Disorder along with their spouses were recruited. Both groups were assessed separately for marital satisfaction and QOL along with demographic details followed by appropriate statistical analysis. A high level of marital distress found amongst both patients and their spouses whereas only patients reported poor QOL. Increasing DUI worsens both marital satisfaction and QOL in spouses with no effects on patients. Illness severity worsens QOL in both groups with no effect on marital satisfaction. Gender was not found to have any impact on either of the groups. Small sample size and cross sectional study design were main limitations. Early and faster intervention will be helpful in patient's prognosis, and also the perception and QOL of spouses. A better treatment response may be expected if focus is at improvement in QOL rather than only symptom control. Further work will be needed with a larger population and in a longitudinal study design. Future research also needs to focus upon establishment of better norms for the DUI for depressive disorder.",

Our findings showed that LA function gradually deteriorated from patients with normotension, across patients with daytime hypertension, to patients with night- and day-nighttime hypertension. LA reservoir and conduit functions were particularly deteriorated in patients with nighttime and day-nighttime hypertension compared with patients with normotension and patients with daytime hypertension, whereas LA pump function was compensatorily increased only in the participants with day-nighttime hypertension. Only nighttime hypertension and day-nighttime hypertension were independently associated with the reduced reservoir and conduit LA function.

Bare intermetallic alloy coupons and coated specimens were submitted to thermal cycling under oxidizing atmosphere up to 850  degrees C or 950  degrees C, at high heating and cooling rates. For this purpose, a burner rig able to simulate the operating conditions of the different stages of turbine engines was used. Microstructures of the samples were compared before and after each test using several techniques (microscopy, XRD, and XPS). Coating-intermetallic substrate adhesion and tribological properties were investigated too. All the TiAlN films provided a remarkable increase in oxidation resistance. Good adhesion properties were observed even after repeated thermal shocks. HiPIMS pretreatments of the substrate surfaces performed before the coating deposition significantly affected the oxidation rate, the oxide layer composition and the coating/substrate adhesion.",

        "abstract": "Mining activities have been carried out for thousands of years and nowadays have an enormous worldwide use to obtain important metals of industrial use. These include copper, iron, gold and several others. Although modern mining companies have sustainable mining programs that include tailings management and external verifications, it is recognized that these industrial activities are responsible for a significant damage to the environment. Specially, technologies such as smelting and roasting generate very toxic emissions, including solid particles in the air, very large tailings and contribute to generate acid mine drainage (AMD) that affects humans health and all kinds of living plants, animals and microorganisms. Consequently, due to environmental restrictions, these methods are being replaced in many countries by less contaminating processes. On the other hand, the microbial solubilization of metals by bioleaching or biomining is successfully used in industrial operations, to extract several metals such as copper, gold and uranium.",

        "abstract": "Acute encephalitis caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) represents a growing epidemic and is a cause for concern in Southeast Asia. JEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of the Culicine mosquito species. The virus genome comprising of an RNA strand also encodes the envelope protein (E) which surrounds the virus. The E protein aids in fusion of virus with the cellular membrane of the host cell with the help of three structurally distinct domains (DI, DII, DIII) that are connected by flexible hinge regions. Of these domains, DIII (JEV-DIII) has been reported to interact with the cellular membrane, aid viral entry and viral replication. Hence JEV-DIII has the potential to be an antigen that can provide immune protection to a JEV infection. In this study, we describe the cloning and expression of DIII of GP-78, a virulent strain of JEV prevalent in India. Our data clearly shows that JEV-DIII expressed from pVAC1 in HEK293T cells is membrane targeted. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a recombinant construct that may block JEV entry into the cells and/or evoke specific antibodies against JEV. Future studies will reveal if our construct will elicit significant immune responses which will alleviate or ameliorate the pro-inflammatory responses induced by JEV.",

        "abstract": "Impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes represent adverse events in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with the second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib. An unweighted genetic risk score (uGRS) for the prediction of insulin resistance, consisting of 10 multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms, has been proposed. We evaluated uGRS predictivity in 61 CML patients treated with nilotinib. Patients were genotyped for IRS1, GRB14, ARL15, PPARG, PEPD, ANKRD55/MAP3K1, PDGFC, LYPLAL1, RSPO3, and FAM13A1 genes. The uGRS was based on the sum of the risk alleles within the set of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Molecular response (MR)(3.0) and MR(4.0) were achieved in 90% and 79% of patients, respectively. Before treatment, none of the patients had abnormal blood glucose. During treatment and subsequent follow-up at 80.2 months (range: 1-298), seven patients (11.5%) had developed diabetes that required oral treatment, a median of 14 months (range: 3-98) after starting nilotinib treatment. Twelve patients (19.7%) had developed prediabetes. Prediabetes/diabetes-free survival was significantly higher in patients with a uGRS <10 than in those with higher scores (100% vs. 22.8 +/- 12.4%, p <0.001). Each increment of one unit in the uGRS caused a 42% increase in the prediabetes/diabetes risk (hazard ratio = 1.42, confidence interval: 1.04-1.94, p = 0.026). The presence of more than 10 allelic variants associated with insulin secretion, processing, sensitivity, and clearance is predictive of prediabetes/diabetes development in CML patients treated with nilotinib. In clinical practice, uGRS could help tailor the best tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.",

As a food, A. roxburghii is widely used as a treatment booster and medicine because of its various beneficial properties; these include, most notably, the curative effects of heat dissipation and cooling of blood, elimination of dampness, detoxification, and immunity enhancement. AIM OF THIS REVIEW: This review aims to provide up-to-date information on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical applications of A. roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant information on A. roxburghii was obtained by an online search of worldwide-accepted scientific databases (Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Elsevier, Springer, NCBI, ACS Publications, CNKI, and Wanfang data). RESULTS: Phytochemical investigations have revealed that the major chemical constituents of A. roxburghii are polysaccharides, flavonoids, glycosides, organic acids, volatile compounds, steroids, triterpenes, alkaloids, and nucleosides. These compounds have been proven to be the main bioactive substances responsible for pharmacological activities such as antidiabetic, antilipemic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, liver protective, renal protective, immunomodulatory, abirritant, sedative, and antineoplastic effects. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of dosage forms of A. roxburghii are currently being applied to patients suffering from hyperuricemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic hepatitis B, Helicobacter pylori infection, cough-variant asthma, and other conditions. Nevertheless, further research is needed to clarify A. roxburghii absorption, distribution, metabolic, and excretion pathways. Moreover, the toxicology in A. roxburghii and A. formosanus are also in urgent need of research, especially long-term in vivo chronic toxicity tests need to be carried out.",

        "abstract": "Stress Granules (SGs) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein aggregates, which have been observed in cells subjected to environmental stresses, such as oxidative stress and heat shock (HS). Although pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, the role of SGs in regulating PSC self-renewal and differentiation has not been fully elucidated. Here we found that sodium arsenite (SA) and HS, but not hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), induce SG formation in human induced (hi) PSCs. Particularly, we found that these granules contain the well-known SG proteins (G3BP, TIAR, eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3B, eIF4G, and PABP), were found in juxtaposition to processing bodies (PBs), and were disassembled after the removal of the stress. Moreover, we showed that SA and HS, but not H2O2, promote eIF2alpha phosphorylation in hiPSCs forming SGs. Analysis of pluripotent protein expression showed that HS significantly reduced all tested markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, L1TD1, and LIN28A), while SA selectively reduced the expression levels of NANOG and L1TD1. Finally, in addition to LIN28A and L1TD1, we identified DPPA5 (pluripotent protein marker) as a novel component of SGs. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular cues of hiPSCs responses to environmental insults.",

Here we present a grooming assay protocol and novel chamber design that is cost-efficient and scalable for either small or large-scale studies of Drosophila grooming. Flies are dusted all over their body with Brilliant Yellow dye and given time to remove the dye from their bodies within the chamber. Flies are then deposited in a set volume of ethanol to solubilize the dye. The relative spectral absorbance of dye-ethanol samples for groomed versus ungroomed animals are measured and recorded. The protocol yields quantitative data of dye accumulation for individual flies, which can be easily averaged and compared across samples. This allows experimental designs to easily evaluate grooming ability for mutant animal studies or circuit manipulations. This efficient procedure is both versatile and scalable. We show work-flow of the protocol and comparative data between WT animals and mutant animals for the Drosophila type I Dopamine Receptor (DopR).",

DESIGN: CT exams from 16 non-radiographic OA (KL grade < 2) and 16 severe medial OA (KL grade >/= 3) knees (average age of 61.7 +/- 3 and 62.2 +/- 5 years old respectively, 50% male in each group), were retrospectively analyzed. CT exams were segmented and 3D maps of sBMD based on the CT number in the most superficial 3 mm of femoral and tibial subchondral bone were computed. Average sBMD and medial-to-lateral sBMD ratios were calculated for total load-bearing regions and for sub-regions of interest in the femur and tibia. RESULTS: The analysis of total load-bearing regions did not reveal any significant difference between groups, except for the lateral tibia, where OA knees had lower sBMD. Sub-regional analysis unveiled differences with some sub-regions of the femur and tibia presenting significantly lower (in the lateral compartment) or higher (in the medial compartment) sBMD in OA knees compared to non-OA knees. The M/L sBMD ratios were significantly higher for OA knees compared to non-OA knees for all regions and sub-regions, except for the internal sub-regions. CONCLUSIONS: sBMD locally differs between non-OA and OA knees, in agreement with prior knowledge on biomechanics. CT proved to be a valuable tool for 3D analysis of femoral and tibial sBMD, which can be used in future studies to describe the chronology of sBMD alterations and improve our understanding of the role of subchondral bone in knee OA.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term effects of vertebral-body-sparing proton craniospinal irradiation (CSI) on the spine of young patients with medulloblastoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Six children between the ages of 3 and 5 years with medulloblastoma were treated with vertebral-body-sparing proton CSI after maximal safe resection. Radiation therapy was delivered in the supine position with posterior beams targeting the craniospinal axis, and the proton beam was stopped anterior to the thecal sac. Patients were treated with a dose of either 23.4 Gy or 36 Gy to the craniospinal axis followed by a boost to the posterior fossa and any metastatic lesions. Chemotherapy varied by protocol. Radiographic effects on the spine were evaluated with serial imaging, either with magnetic resonance imaging scans or plain film using Cobb angle calculations, the presence of thoracic lordosis, lumbar vertebral body-to-disc height ratios, and anterior-posterior height ratios. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by patient/family interview and medical chart review. RESULTS: Overall survival and disease free survival were 83% (5/6) at follow-up. Median clinical and radiographic follow-up were 13.6 years and 12.3 years, respectively. Two patients were clinically diagnosed with scoliosis and treated conservatively. At the time of follow-up, no patients had experienced chronic back pain or required spine surgery. No patients were identified to have thoracic lordosis. Diminished growth of the posterior portions of vertebral bodies was identified in all patients, with an average posterior to anterior ratio of 0.88, which was accompanied by compensatory hypertrophy of the posterior intervertebral discs. CONCLUSION: Vertebral-body-sparing CSI with proton beam did not appear to cause increased severe spinal abnormalities in patients treated at our institution. This approach could be considered in future clinical trials in an effort to reduce toxicity and the risk of secondary malignancy and to improve adult height.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colour vision of candidates is tested in many medical colleges in India at the time of admission to undergraduate courses; however, there are no guidelines, and therefore no counselling, on how students with congenital colour vision deficiency (CCVD) should negotiate the medical course, and how best they can practise safely after graduation. Problems in interpreting coloured signs may lead to misdiagnosis. This study aimed to explore difficulties during clinical work that requires colour discrimination, and to offer suggestions on safe practice based on the findings and a review of the literature. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study after obtaining institutional ethical clearance and written informed consent. Thirty volunteer medical students with CCVD (>/=3 errors on Ishihara chart) were matched with 30 volunteers from their own batch who made no errors. All participants interpreted colour-dependent clinical and laboratory photographs. RESULTS: Students with CCVD made more errors (range 5-26; mean [SD] 13.17 [5.873] out of 75 items in 35 colour-dependent photographs) than colour-normal students (range 2-13; mean [SD] 5.53 [3.037], p<0.001). The nature of the errors suggested that medical students with CCVD could have problems in learning histology, pathology, haematology, microbiology, dermatology, paediatrics, medicine, biochemistry and during ophthalmoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening at the time of admission will make students aware of their CCVD status and, through conscious practice thereafter, they may understand their limitations. Faculty could guide and prepare such students for safe practice.",

In doing so, we elucidate the dual functions that incorporated Au can play as a water reduction cocatalyst and as a plasmonic sensitizer. We also photodeposit non-plasmonic Pt cocatalyst nanoparticles into our composite aerogels in order to leverage the catalytic water-reducing abilities of Pt. This Au-TiO(2)/Pt arrangement in three dimensions effectively utilizes conduction-band electrons injected into the TiO(2) aerogel network upon exciting the Au SPR at the Au parallelTiO(2) interface. The extensive nanostructured high surface-area oxide network in the aerogel provides a matrix that spatially separates yet electrochemically connects plasmonic nanoparticle sensitizers and metal nanoparticle catalysts, further enhancing solar-fuels photochemistry. We compare the photocatalytic rates of H(2) generation with and without Pt cocatalysts added to Au-TiO(2) aerogels and demonstrate electrochemical linkage of the SPR-generated carriers at the Au parallelTiO(2) interfaces to downfield Pt nanoparticle cocatalysts. Finally, we investigate visible light-stimulated generation of conduction band electrons in Au-TiO(2) and TiO(2) aerogels using ultrafast visible pump/IR probe spectroscopy. Substantially more electrons are produced at Au-TiO(2) aerogels due to the incorporated SPR-active Au nanoparticle, whereas the smaller population of electrons generated at Au-free TiO(2) aerogels likely originate at shallow traps in the high surface-area mesoporous aerogel.",

        "abstract": "Faces are highly complex stimuli that contain a host of information. Such complexity poses the following questions: (a) do observers exhibit preferences for specific information? (b) how does sensitivity to individual face parts compare? These questions were addressed by quantifying sensitivity to different face features. Discrimination thresholds were determined for synthetic faces under the following conditions: (i) 'full face': all face features visible; (ii) 'isolated feature': single feature presented in isolation; (iii) 'embedded feature': all features visible, but only one feature modified. Mean threshold elevations for isolated features, relative to full-faces, were 0.84x, 1.08, 2.12, 3.34, 4.07 and 4.47 for head-shape, hairline, nose, mouth, eyes and eyebrows respectively. Hence, when two full faces can be discriminated at threshold, the difference between the eyes is about four times less than what is required when discriminating between isolated eyes. In all cases, sensitivity was higher when features were presented in isolation than when they were embedded within a face context (threshold elevations of 0.94x, 1.74, 2.67, 2.90, 5.94 and 9.94). This reveals a specific pattern of sensitivity to face information. Observers are between two and four times more sensitive to external than internal features. The pattern for internal features (higher sensitivity for the nose, compared to mouth, eyes and eyebrows) is consistent with lower sensitivity for those parts affected by facial dynamics (e.g. facial expressions). That isolated features are easier to discriminate than embedded features supports a holistic face processing mechanism which impedes extraction of information about individual features from full faces.",

Ten healthy volunteers (mean age 21.3 +/- 0.7 years; 4 women) underwent cycle ergometer exercise at 30% or 50% of VO(2)peak for 20 min, followed by an 8-min post-exercise rest (PER).

The O(2)Hb, SBF, and MAP increased in the exercise phase. SBF degraded over time, and MAP decreased immediately after exercise. The O(2)Hb decreased immediately and increased again in the PER. There were no significant differences between exercise and PER in the SMC in the 30% VO(2)peak experiment or in the SMA and SMC in the 50% VO(2)peak experiment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Penicillin allergy is commonly reported in the pediatric emergency department (ED). True penicillin allergy is rare, yet the diagnosis results from the denial of first-line antibiotics. We hypothesize that all children presenting to the pediatric ED with symptoms deemed to be low-risk for immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity will return negative results for true penicillin allergy. METHODS: Parents of children aged 4 to 18 years old presenting to the pediatric ED with a history of parent-reported penicillin allergy completed an allergy questionnaire. A prespecified 100 children categorized as low-risk on the basis of reported symptoms completed penicillin allergy testing by using a standard 3-tier testing process. The percent of children with negative allergy testing results was calculated with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Five hundred ninety-seven parents completed the questionnaire describing their child's reported allergy symptoms. Three hundred two (51%) children had low-risk symptoms and were eligible for testing. Of those, 100 children were tested for penicillin allergy. The median (interquartile range) age at testing was 9 years (5-12). The median (interquartile range) age at allergy diagnosis was 1 year (9 months-3 years). Rash (97 [97%]) and itching (63 [63%]) were the most commonly reported allergy symptoms. Overall, 100 children (100%; 95% confidence interval 96.4%-100%) were found to have negative results for penicillin allergy and had their labeled penicillin allergy removed from their medical record. CONCLUSIONS: All children categorized as low-risk by our penicillin allergy questionnaire were found to have negative results for true penicillin allergy. The utilization of this questionnaire in the pediatric ED may facilitate increased use of first-line penicillin antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of pulmonary aspergilloma in symptomatic patients offers a significant chance of cure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery is a valid alternative for properly selected cases. We herein report our experience with thoracoscopic management of pulmonary aspergilloma. PATIENT AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis was performed on 41 patients operated between 2012 to 2015. The patient records were thoroughly analyzed for demography, clinical presentation, computed tomography , the procedure performed , post-operative complications and course during 6 month's follow up. RESULTS: Out of total 41 patients, 23 (56%) were treated by VATS and 18 (44%) by thoracotomy. Average intraoperative blood loss was 214 ml (+/-106) in VATS group and 461 ml (+/-167) in thoracotomy. Mean operative time was 162 (+/-14) minutes in VATS and 239 (+/-12) minutes in thoracotomy group. In VATS group, postoperative complications were found in 5 patients and in 11 patients in the thoracotomy group. Average duration of chest tube was 5.43 () days in VATS group and 8.94 () days in thoracotomy group. Average length of hospital stay was 5.04 in VATS group and 6.55 days in thoracotomy group. CONCLUSIONS: VATS for pulmonary aspergilloma, if applicable, may be a safe and efficacious option in experienced hands. Simple aspergilloma, in particular , is considered to be a good indication for VATS. Some cases of complex aspergilloma may also be amenable to VATS. However, the long term results need to be further analyzed using a larger study group.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hypoperfusion is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that influences the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Understanding the mechanism is of critical importance in the search for new effective therapies. We hypothesized that cerebral hypoperfusion promotes the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and degenerative changes in the brain and is a potential mechanism contributing to development of dementia. To address this, we studied the effects of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis on Abeta peptide pools in a transgenic mouse model of AD (transgenic mice with Swedish, Dutch and Iowa mutations in human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Tg-SwDI)). Cerebrovascular integrity was characterized by quantifying the occurrence of microinfarcts and haemorrhages and compared with wild-type mice without Abeta. A significant increase in soluble Abeta peptides (Abeta40/42) was detected after 1 month of hypoperfusion in the parenchyma in parallel with elevated APP and APP proteolytic products. Following 3 months, a significant increase in insoluble Abeta40/42 was determined in the parenchyma and vasculature. Microinfarct load was significantly increased in the Tg-SwDI as compared with wild-type mice and further exacerbated by hypoperfusion at 1 and 3 months. In addition, the number of Tg-SwDI hypoperfused mice with haemorrhages was increased compared with hypoperfused wild-type mice. Soluble parenchymal Abeta was associated with elevated NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2) which was exacerbated by 1-month hypoperfusion. We suggest that in response to hypoperfusion, increased Abeta production/deposition may contribute to degenerative processes by triggering oxidative stress promoting cerebrovascular disruption and the development of microinfarcts.",

These proteins, found in plants, bacteria and fungi, present different biological properties including catalytic hydrolysis of urea, and also enzyme-independent activities, such as induction of exocytosis, pro-inflammatory effects, neurotoxicity, antifungal and insecticidal properties. Urease is toxic to insects and fungi per se but part of this toxicity relies on an internal peptide (~11 kDa), which is released upon digestion of the protein by insect enzymes. A recombinant form of this peptide, called jaburetox (JBTX), was constructed using jbureII gene as a template. The peptide exhibits liposome disruption properties, and insecticidal and fungicidal activities. Here we review the known biological properties activities of JBTX, and comment on new ones not yet fully characterized. JBTX was able to cause mortality of Aedes aegypti larvae in a feeding assay whereas in a dose as low as of 0.1 mug it provoked death of Triatoma infestans bugs. JBTX (10(-5)-10(-6) M) inhibits the growth of E. coli, P. aeruginosa and B. cereus after 24 h incubation. Multilamellar liposomes interacting with JBTX undergo reorganization of the membrane's lipids as detected by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies. Encapsulating JBTX into lipid nanoparticles led to an increase of the peptide's antifungal activity. Transgenic tobacco and sugarcane plants expressing the insecticidal peptide JBTX, showed increased resistance to attack of the insect pests Spodoptera frugiperda, Diatraea saccharalis and Telchin licus licus. Many questions remain unanswered; however, so far, JBTX has shown to be a versatile peptide that can be used against various insect and fungus species, and in new bacterial control strategies.",

The aim of this study is to analyze patients' (patients) risk factors of left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) prior to CA-AF in daily clinical practice, according to oral anticoagulation (OAC) strategies recommended by current guidelines. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients scheduled for CA-AF from 01/2015 to 12/2016 in our center were included and either treated with NOACs (novel-OAC; paused 24-hours preablation) or continuous vitamin K antagonists (INR 2.0-3.0). All patients received a preprocedural TEE at the day of ablation. Two groups were defined: (1) patients without LAAT, (2) patients with LAAT. The incidence of LAAT was 0.78% (13 of 1,658 patients). No LAAT was detected in patients with a CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc score of </=1 (n = 640 patients) irrespective of the underlying AF type. Independent predictors for LAAT are: higher CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc scores (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95%-confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.23, P = 0.0019), a history of nonparoxysmal AF (OR 7.96, 95%-CI: 1.52-146.64, P = 0.049), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM; OR 9.63, 95% CI: 1.36-43.05, P = 0.007), and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% (OR 8.32, 95% CI: 1.18-36.29, P = 0.011). The type of OAC was not predictive (P = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of LAAT in patients scheduled for CA-AF is low. Therefore, periprocedural OAC strategies recommended by current guidelines seem feasible. Preprocedural TEE may be dispensed in patients with a CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc score </=1. However, a CHA(2) DS(2) -VASc score >/=2, reduced LVEF, HCM, or history of nonparoxysmal AF are independently associated with an increased risk for LAAT.",

        "abstract": "C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1 were proven to play important roles in several types of cancer and in many biological processes connected with tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, the clinical significance of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1 expression in colorectal cancer remains inaccurate. The purpose of this systematic meta-analysis is to investigate the role of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1 as prognostic factors for survival and the association between C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4/ stromal cell-derived factor-1 and clinicopathology in colorectal cancer. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant literatures updated till January 2017. Review Manager 5.3 was used for data analysis. In our meta-analysis, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 expression is related to tumor-node-metastasis stage, tumor differentiation, liver metastasis, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and diagnosis, and no correlation of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 expression with tumor size, gender, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen, age, or vascular invasion has been observed. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 expression has no relationship with tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, age, gender, distant metastasis, or diagnosis. The expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 has association with tumor differentiation. Moreover, the pooled hazard ratio for disease-free survival/overall survival showed that overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4/stromal cell-derived factor-1 reduced disease-free survival/overall survival in colorectal cancer. Therefore, High expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4/stromal cell-derived factor-1 which is essential in tumor progression can predict poor survival that may provide more advance prognostic clues to colorectal cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Lichong Shengsui Yin (LCSSY) is an effective and classic compound prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) used for the treatment of ovarian cancer. To investigate its pharmacodynamic basis for treating ovarian cancer, the multi-dimensional spectrum-effect relationship was determined. Four compositions (I to IV) were obtained by extracting LCSSY successively with supercritical CO(2) fluid extraction, 75% ethanol reflux extraction, and the water extraction-ethanol precipitation method. Nine samples for pharmacological evaluation and fingerprint analysis were prepared by changing the content of the four compositions. The specific proportions of the four compositions were designed according to a four-factor, three-level L(9)(3(4)) orthogonal test. The pharmacological evaluation included in vitro tumor inhibition experiments and the survival extension rate in tumor-bearing nude mice. The fingerprint analyzed by chromatographic condition I (high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detec tor\uff0cHPLC-PDA) identified 19 common peaks. High-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector-Evaporative Light-scattering Detector (HPLC-PDA-ELSD )hyphenated techniques were used to compensate for the use of a single detector, and the fingerprint analyzed by chromatographic condition II identified 28 common peaks in PDA and 23 common peaks in ELSD. Furthermore, multiple statistical analyses were utilized to calculate the relationships between the peaks and the pharmacological results. The union of the regression and the correlation analysis results were the peaks of X(5), X(9), X(11), X(12), X(16), X(18), Y(5), Y(8), Y(12), Y(14), Y(20), Z(4), Z(5), Z(6), and Z(8). The intersection of the regression and the correlation analysis results were the peaks of X(11), X(12), X(16), X(18), Y(5), Y(12), and Z(5). The correlated peaks were assigned by comparing the fingerprints with the negative control samples and reference standard samples, and identifying the structure using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detector(HPLC-MS). The results suggested that the pharmacodynamic basis of LCSSY on anti-ovarian cancer activities were germacrone, furandiene, beta-elemene, calycosin-7-glucoside, ononin, epimedin B, icariin, ginsenoside Rc, astragaloside, ginsenoside Rd, astragaloside II, and some unknown components.",

ITH can be well-measured using multi-region sampling but this is costly and challenging to implement. There is therefore a need for tools to estimate ITH in individual samples, using standard genomic data such as SNP-arrays, that could be implemented routinely. We designed two novel scores S and R, respectively based on the Shannon diversity index and Ripley's L statistic of spatial homogeneity, to quantify ITH in single SNP-array samples. We created in-silico and in-vitro mixtures of tumour clones, in which diversity was known for benchmarking purposes. We found significant but highly-variable associations of our scores with diversity in-silico (p < 0.001) and moderate associations in-vitro (p = 0.015 and p = 0.085). Our scores were also correlated to previous ITH estimates from sequencing data but heterogeneity in the fraction of tumour cells present across samples hampered accurate quantification. The prognostic potential of both scores was moderate but significantly predictive of survival in several tumour types (corrected p = 0.03). Our work thus shows how individual SNP-arrays reveal intra-sample clonal diversity with moderate accuracy.",

METHODS: A total of 416 children with H.pylori infection were randomly assigned to sequential group (102 children), triple group (100 children), sequential-Lactobacillus group (109 children), and triple-Lactobacillus group (105 children). The clinical outcome, H.pylori eradication rate, cost-effect ratio, and incidence of adverse events were compared between the four groups. RESULTS: The sequential-Lactobacillus and triple-Lactobacillus groups had significantly better clinical outcomes than the sequential group and the triple group (P<0.05). The sequential-Lactobacillus group had the highest marked response rate, followed by the triple-Lactobacillus group. The triple group had the lowest marked response rate. The sequential-Lactobacillus group also had the highest H.pylori eradication rate, followed by the triple-Lactobacillus group. The triple group had the lowest H.pylori eradication rate (P<0.05). The sequential group had the lowest cost-effect ratio, followed by the sequential-Lactobacillus group. The triple group had the highest cost-effect ratio (P<0.01).

Then, a smartwatch system that implements a wide range of self-regulation strategies and infers outburst patterns from physiological signals and movement is presented, along with an authoring tool for smartphones that is to be used by caregivers or family members to create and edit these strategies, in an adaptive way. We conducted an intensive experiment with two individuals with ASD who showed varied, representative behavioral responses to their emotional dysregulation. Both users were able to employ effective, customized emotional self-regulation strategies by means of the system, recovering from the majority of mild stress episodes and temper tantrums experienced in the nine days of experiment in their classroom.",

In this work, we show that this qualitative assumption is not necessarily valid by comparing the biological activity, log P, and cellular uptake of three ruthenium-based PACT complexes: [Ru(bpy)(2)(dmbpy)](2+), [Ru(bpy)(2)(mtmp)](2+), and [Ru(Ph(2)phen)(2)(mtmp)](2+).

Therefore, it was necessary to determine whether a dendrimer was suitable for further evaluation in an in vitro model of semen-enhanced viral infection (SEVI). We demonstrated that SEVI in TZM.bl cell cultures increased the infectivity of R5-HIV-1(NL(AD8)), pTHRO.c and pCH058.c isolates, causing higher IC(50) values for two polyanionic carbosilane dendrimers, G2-STE16 and G3-S16. However, both dendrimers maintained protection rates of 90% at non-toxic concentrations. When dendrimers were combined with Tenofovir/Maraviroc (TDF/MVC), the anti-HIV-1 effect remained at a minimum IC(50) increase between 1- and 7-fold in the presence of amyloid fibrils. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), IC(50) values were slightly influenced by the presence of semen. In brief, dendrimers combined with antiretrovirals showed a synergistic effect. This result plays a crucial role in new microbicide formulations, as it overcomes the negative effects of amyloid fibrils.",

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is one of the most important targets for treatment of cancer, specifically for breast and lung cancer. In the present research work, Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA) studies were performed on 50 compounds reported as mTOR inhibitors. Three different alignment methods were used, and among them, distill method was found to be the best method. In CoMFA, leave-one-out cross-validated coefficients [Formula: see text], conventional coefficient [Formula: see text], and predicted correlation coefficient [Formula: see text] values were found to be 0.664, 0.992, and 0.652, respectively. CoMSIA study was performed in 25 different combinations of features, such as steric, electrostatic, hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, and hydrophobic. From this, a combination of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic (SEH), and a combination of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, donor, and acceptor (SEHDA) were found as best combinations. In CoMSIA (SEHDA), [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] were found to be 0.646, 0.977, and 0.682, respectively, while in the case of CoMSIA (SEH), the values were 0.739, 0.976, and 0.779, respectively. Contour maps were generated and validated by molecular dynamics simulation-assisted molecular docking study. Highest active compound 19, moderate active compound 15, and lowest active compound 42 were docked on mTOR protein to validate the results of our molecular docking study. The result of the molecular docking study of highest active compound 19 is in line with the outcomes generated by contour maps. Based on the features obtained through this study, six novel mTOR inhibitors were designed and docked. This study could be useful for designing novel molecules with increased anticancer activity.",

METHOD: We evaluated substance use, mental health, and violence-related correlates of past 30-day gambling among 833 Veterans (93% male, M age 48years, 72% Caucasian) seeking treatment in VA outpatient mental health and SUD clinics who completed screening for a randomized clinical trial. RESULTS: A total of 288 (35%) Veterans reported past 30-day gambling. Among those who gambled, 79% had cravings/urges to gamble, whereas between 20%-27% of gamblers reported perceived relationship, legal, and daily life problems related to gambling, as well as difficulty controlling gambling. A logistic regression analysis revealed that age, recent binge-drinking, and non-partner physical aggression were associated with recent gambling. CONCLUSIONS: Gambling was associated with binge-drinking and non-partner physical aggression, supporting potential shared characteristics among these behaviors such as impulsivity and risk-taking, which may complicate SUD treatment engagement and effectiveness. Findings support the need to screen for gambling in the VA, and to adapt treatments to include gambling as a potential behavioral target or relapse trigger, particularly among heavy drinking patients.",

Lymph node metastasis is the most significant prognostic factor in EMCA. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has become a well-accepted procedure in surgical oncology and may strike a balance between the risks and benefits of lymphadenectomy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the current literature regarding the history, techniques, and clinical application of SLN mapping in EMCA. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was obtained through systematic literature review through PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node biopsy for EMCA is an accepted approach to the staging of this cancer; however, a consensus approach to the SLN biopsy technique and pathologic assessment is needed. Surgeons newly adopting the technique should proceed with caution and care to monitor outcomes.",

Proximal migration of shunt is rare and possible pathophysiological mechanisms to explain this unusual complication is rarely attempted. A 5-month-old child shunted for posttraumatic hydrocephalus presented 1.5 years later with raised intracranial pressure and seizures. Imaging showed subdural hygroma, partial intracranial migration of shunt/chamber. On endoscopy, choroid plexus was adherent to shunt tip and some pericranial tissue was found in the anchoring suture (intraventricularly displaced). Shunt was retrieved endoscopically and diversion established by endoscopic third ventriculostomy with symptoms free follow-up. Host-related and surgical factors have been postulated. Tug-of-war effect on the anchoring suture and collapsing cortex are the possible mechanisms that explain proximal migration in our case. Three-point fixation of the chamber to pericranium, small burr hole with a smaller durotomy, can prevent shunt migration. Proximal shunt migrations should be dealt with endoscopy so as to avoid complications.",

The condensate and oil yields reached maximum (i.e. 12.86 wt% and 0.84 wt%, respectively) at 650  degrees C. The content of aromatic compounds in the oil increased as temperature increased, up to 88.38% (GC-MS area) at 750  degrees C. Heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing nitrogen accounted for 20%-58% of the pyrolysis oil. Addition of catalysts such as CaO and Fe decreased pyrolysis oil yield and increased the content of H(2). The H(2) content increased from 25.39v% without catalyst to 64.17v% with addition of 30 wt% CaO. The electricity consumption was 0.80-2.64 kWh/kg wet sludge from 450 to 750  degrees C and auger speed range of 1-9 rpm. Higher auger speeds and lower temperatures led to lower electricity consumption.",

Unlike the reactions of metal carbenes with electron-withdrawing groups attached, the attenuated electrophilicity enables these reactions to be conducted in Lewis basic solvents (e.g., acetonitrile) and in the presence of water. The diazo precursors for these species are prepared in situ from hydrazone using a mild and chemoselective oxidant (MnO(2) ). Although this sequence often can be performed in one-pot, control experiments have elucidated why a \"two-pot\" process is often more efficient. A thorough screening of achiral catalysts demonstrated that sterically encumbered catalysts are optimal for diastereoselective reactions. Although efficient insertion into allylic and propargylic C-H bonds is observed, competing dipolar cycloaddition processes are noted for some substrates. The full substrate scope of this useful method of benzodihydrofuran synthesis, mechanisms of side reactions, and computational support for the origins of stereoselectivity are described.",

In this paper, we examine some of the ethical issues in medical toxicology research that are especially salient in effort to promote optimal research in the field. The particular issues to be addressed are as follows: (1) rare conditions and orphan agents, (2) randomization and control arms, (3) inclusion and exclusion criteria, (4) outcome measures, (5) consent, (6) confidentiality, (7) registries, (8) oversight, and (9) transparency and reporting.

In polymer engineering, different research studies utilize HNTs that exhibit a beneficial enhancement in the properties of polymer-based nanocomposites. The dispersion of HNTs is improved as a result of pre-treating HNTs with acids. The HNTs' percentage additive up to 7% shows the highest improvement of tensile strength. The degradation of the polymer can be also significantly improved by doping a low percentage of HNTs. Both the mechanical and thermal properties of polymers were remarkably improved when mixed with HNTs. The effects of HNTs on the mechanical and thermal properties of polymers, such as ultimate strength, elastic modulus, impact strength and thermal stability, are emphasized in this study.",

Participants were 111 young children between 9 and 48 months. Children passively viewed an affective attention bias task that consisted of a face pairing (neutral paired with either neutral, angry or happy) for 500 ms that was followed by a 1,500-ms asterisk probe on 1 side of the screen. Congruent trials were trials in which the probe appeared on the same side of the screen as the emotional face and incongruent trials were trials in which the probe appeared on the opposite side of the emotional face. The latency to fixate on the probe, rather than the traditional task's button press latency, was measured for both types of trials and a bias score was calculated by subtracting the latency to the probe on congruent trials from that on incongruent trials. The results of the current study indicate positive internal reliability of this modified version of the DPT as well as the presence of a bias toward both angry and happy faces during the first 4 years of life. The successful use of the modified version of the DPT for use on the eye tracker presents a promising methodological tool for research on early attentional behavior and provides a tool for comprehensive longitudinal studies of identified risk factors for anxiety.

The progression of lung cancer involves dynamic changes in the genome and a complex network of interactions between cancer cells with multiple, distinct cell types that form tumors. Combination therapy using different pharmaceuticals has been proven highly effective due to the ability to affect multiple cellular pathways involved in the disease progression. However, the currently used drug combination designs are primarily based on empirical clinical studies, and little attention has been given to dosage regimens, i.e. how administration routes, onsets, and durations of the combinations influence the therapeutic outcome. This is partly because combination therapy is challenged by distinct physicochemical properties and in vivo pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the individual pharmaceuticals, including small molecule drugs and biopharmaceuticals, which make the optimization of dosing and administration schedule challenging. This article reviews the recent advances in the design and development of combinations of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of lung cancer. Focus is primarily on rationales for the selection of specific combination therapies for lung cancer treatment, and state of the art of delivery technologies and dosage regimens for the combinations, tested in preclinical and clinical trials.",

PURPOSE: We investigated the longitudinal changes in EB over one season and explored the association between EB variation and change in the main fat-free mass (FFM) components in highly trained athletes. METHODS: Eighty athletes (54 males; handball, volleyball, basketball, triathlete, and swimming) were evaluated from the beginning of the season to the main competition stage. Resting and total energy expenditure (REE and TEE, respectively) were assessed by indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water, respectively. Physical activity energy expenditure was calculated as TEE - 0.1 TEE - REE. Fat mass (FM), FFM, and bone mineral were evaluated with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; changed body energy stores were calculated as 1.0(DeltaFFM/Deltatime) + 9.5(DeltaFM/Deltatime). Total-body water (TBW) and its compartments were assessed through dilution techniques, and total-body protein was calculated from a four-compartment model, with body volume assessed by air displacement plethysmography. RESULTS: Although a negative EB of -17.4 +/- 72.7 kcal.d was observed (P < 0.05), EB varied widely among sports and across sex groups resulting in a net weight increase (0.7 +/- 2.3 kg) that is attributable to significant changes in FFM (1.2 +/- 1.6 kg) and FM (-0.7 +/- 1.5 kg) (P < 0.05). EB was related with TBW and intracellular water (r = 0.354, r = 0.257, P < 0.05, respectively), regardless of sex, sports, and age. CONCLUSIONS: The mean negative EB observed over the season resulted from the rate of FM use and FFM accretion, but with a large variation by sex and sports. TBW, but not total-body protein or mineral balance, explained the magnitude of EB, which means that athletes under a positive or a negative EB showed a TBW expansion or shrinkage, respectively, specifically within the cells, over one athletic season.",

Recent studies show that increased production of reactive oxygen species is an important factor in etiopathogenesis of pregnancy and affects female reproduction. It was found that oxidative stress may damage the oocytes and may impair their fertilization capacity. Oxidative stress may also lead to embryo fragmentation and formation of numerous developmental abnormalities, and is regarded to be one of the important reasons of spontaneous and recurrent miscarriage. Moreover, overproduction of reactive oxygen species has a significant impact on the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of all sites of disease, in combination with effective systemic chemotherapy, offers the only potential chance for cure for patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC). Coordinated multistage resection using a minimally invasive approach may provide optimal oncologic outcome while potentially offering the benefit of decreased morbidity. PATIENT: A 66-year-old women presented with transverse colon cancer and synchronous metastasis (CRLM) in segment IV involving the middle hepatic vein and main left portal pedicle, as well as the left adrenal gland. Due to favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX/bevacizumab), the patient was considered for resection but developed some obstructive symptoms from the primary tumor, necessitating re-coordination of treatment sequencing from the 'liver-first' approach. METHODS: The first procedure combined laparoscopic subtotal colectomy (extracorporeal anastomosis) with left adrenalectomy. After restaging, CRLM was removed separately 2 months later via laparoscopic left hepatectomy extending beyond the middle hepatic vein. Successful completion of the two procedures depended on optimal patient/port positioning for the combined colon/adrenal surgery and the second-stage liver resection. Postoperative lengths of stay were 4 and 3 days, respectively, and were without complication. Adjuvant FOLFOX was initiated 21 days following liver surgery, and the patient has been disease-free for 36 months. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the feasibility of the total laparoscopic approach to multivisceral resection for synchronous stage IV CRC in the context of a preplanned, staged multidisciplinary strategy. This approach may offer optimal cancer management, including early return to systemic therapy, shortened time intervals between stages, and minimal postoperative morbidity.1 (-) 3.",

Yet, its benefits exclude dental, vision, hearing, and long-term services, and it contains no ceiling on out-of-pocket costs for covered services, exposing beneficiaries to high costs. GOAL: To inform discussion of possible changes to Medicare, this issue brief looks at beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs by income and health status. METHODS: Spending estimates based on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: More than one-fourth of all Medicare beneficiaries--15 million people--spend 20 percent or more of their incomes on premiums plus medical care, including cost-sharing and uncovered services. Beneficiaries with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level (just under $24,000 for a single person) and those with multiple chronic conditions or functional limitations are at significant financial risk. Overall, beneficiaries spent an average of $3,024 per year on out-of-pocket costs. Financial burdens and access gaps highlight the need to approach reform with caution. Already-high burdens suggest restructuring cost-sharing to ensure affordability and to provide relief for low-income beneficiaries.",

Using a mediation-analytical approach with three age- and gender-matched groups - overweight/obese adults with (n = 42) and without (n = 104) BED, and normal-weight control participants (n = 73) - we tested the hypothesis that adults with BED would engage in more addictive behaviors and have higher scores on a personality-risk index than the two control groups. We also anticipated that the relationship between BED and addictive behaviors would be mediated by a high-risk personality profile. The predicted mediation effect was strongly supported. Contrary to expectation, BED participants did not engage in more addictive behaviors or have higher personality-risk scores than their weight-matched counterparts. However, both overweight/obese groups did have significantly higher scores than the normal-weight group. The relationships among personality risk, elevated body mass index (BMI), and addictive behaviors have important clinical implications, especially for treatments that target psycho-behavioral intervention for compulsive overeating and substance-use disorders.",

OBJECTIVES: To examine the socio-demographic, psychosocial and clinical risk factors associated with adolescent pregnancy. METHODS: An analytical prevalence study was performed using secondary data from the First Demographic Study of Mental Health in Medellin, Colombia. Female adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age were included in the study. The population was evaluated using the Composite International Diagnosis Interview, a structured interview developed by the World Health Organization, which establishes diagnoses according to the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. RESULTS: A sample of 499 female adolescents was obtained, in which 135 adolescent pregnancies were identified, representing a prevalence of 21.5%. The large majority (84.4%) were between 16 and 19 years old. The median age was 17 years, with an interquartile range of 2 years. Almost two-thirds (61.2%) of female adolescents had initiated sexual activity at the age of 15 or later. Almost one-third (31.9%) reported being physically abused during childhood, and 6.7% sexually abused. Of those who were pregnant, 66.7% reported previous sexual abuse. A bivariate analysis showed that sexual abuse (OR=7.68), childhood negligence (OR=4.33), and having a partner (OR=6.31) were factors associated with an adolescent pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Negligence and sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence can be prevented, and adolescent pregnancies can be decreased. This finding has important implications for clinical management and prognosis, and requires public preventive policies.",

Hemoglobin S (HbS) and hemoglobin C (HbC) mutations are frequently encountered in malaria-endemic areas of Africa, where they protect children from severe and uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, scant epidemiological data exist on the impact of these Hb variants on PAM. A prospective cohort of 635 Beninese pregnant women was recruited before 24 weeks of gestational age and followed until the end of pregnancy. HbAA, HbAC, and HbAS genotypes were determined and tested for association with pregnancy outcomes and PAM indicators using linear and logistic multivariate models. Newborns from HbAC mothers had higher birthweights than those from HbAA mothers among women infected at any time during pregnancy (mean difference 182.9 g, p = 0.08), or during the first half of pregnancy (654.3 g, p = 0.0006). No such birthweight differences were observed between newborns from HbAS and HbAA mothers. HbAC and HbAS were not associated with other pregnancy outcomes or PAM indicators. In conclusion, HbAC but not HbAS is associated with an improved birth outcome in pregnant women with documented PAM. Higher-birthweight newborns from HbAC mothers may have a survival advantage that contributes to the natural selection of HbC in malaria-endemic areas.",

The use of tympanometric gradient in addition to static admittance is the focus of this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors enrolled 146 female and 129 male patients. The participants were allocated into groups as follow: Group A1 consisted of 50 healthy children. Group A2 consisted of 86 children with otitis media with effusion. Group B1 consisted of 85 healthy adults. Group B2 consisted of 54 adults with otitis media with effusion. All diagnostic otoscopic examination and tympanometry were performed in both ears. The authors analyzed the distribution of tympanograms in patients with otitis media with effusion and healthy controls. RESULTS: When the right and left ear canal volume of either children or adults with otitis media with effusion compared with healthy controls, no statistically significant different was observed (P > 0.05). On the other hand, the statistically significant difference was detected for the values of compliance, pressure and gradient of either children or adults with otitis media with effusion compared with healthy controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The authors found the values range from 0.01 to 1.52 mL gradients (mean least value 0.15 mL) in adults and the values range from 0.01 to 0.93 mL gradients (mean least value 0.10 mL) in children in the presence of otitis media with effusion. The authors think that tympanometric gradient may be useful to detect the otitis media with effusion.",

The effect of pressure on two polytypes of tris(mu(2)-3,5-diiso-propyl-1,2,4-triazolato-kappa(2)N(1):N(2))trigold(I) (denoted Form-I and Form-II) has been analysed using luminescence spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and first-principles computation. A unique phase behaviour was observed in Form-I, with a complex sequence of phase transitions between 1 and 3.5 GPa. The ambient C2/c mother cell transforms to a P2(1)/n phase above 1 GPa, followed by a P2(1)/a phase above 2 GPa and a large-volume C2/c supercell at 2.70 GPa, with the previously observed P2(1)/n phase then reappearing at higher pressure. The observation of crystallographically identical low- and high-pressure P2(1)/n phases makes this a rare example of a re-entrant phase transformation. The phase behaviour has been characterized using detailed crystallographic theory and modelling, and rationalized in terms of molecular structural distortions. The dramatic changes in conformation are correlated with shifts of the luminescence maxima, from a band maximum at 14040 cm(-1) at 2.40 GPa, decreasing steeply to 13550 cm(-1) at 3 GPa. A similar study of Form-II displays more conventional crystallographic behaviour, indicating that the complex behaviour observed in Form-I is likely to be a direct consequence of the differences in crystal packing between the two polytypes.",

As a result, 23 differentially expressed miRNAs in dry seeds were identified and confirmed between GM wheat and a non-GM acceptor. Notably, more differentially expressed tae-miRNAs between non-GM wheat varieties were found, indicating that the degree of variance between non-GM cultivars was considerably higher than that induced by the transgenic event. Most of the target genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs between GM wheat and a non-GM acceptor were associated with abiotic stress, in accordance with the product concept of GM wheat in improving drought and salt tolerance.

We previously identified a peptide sequence with high affinity towards apatite (VTKHLNQISQSY, VTK) using phage display. The aims of this study were to identify a human MSC-specific peptide sequence through phage display, combine it with the apatite-specific sequence, and verify the specificity of the combined dual-functioning peptide to both apatite and human bone marrow stromal cells. In this study, a combinatorial phage display identified the cell binding sequence (DPIYALSWSGMA, DPI) which was combined with the mineral binding sequence to generate the dual peptide DPI-VTK. DPI-VTK demonstrated significantly greater binding affinity (1/K(D)) to apatite surfaces compared to VTK, phosphorylated VTK (VTK(phos)), DPI-VTK(phos), RGD-VTK, and peptide-free apatite surfaces (p < 0.01), while significantly increasing hBMSC adhesion strength (tau(50), p < 0.01). MSCs demonstrated significantly greater adhesion strength to DPI-VTK compared to other cell types, while attachment of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts and murine fibroblasts was limited (p < 0.01). MSCs on DPI-VTK coated surfaces also demonstrated increased spreading compared to pre-osteoblasts and fibroblasts. MSCs cultured on DPI-VTK coated apatite films exhibited significantly greater proliferation compared to controls (p < 0.001). Moreover, early and late stage osteogenic differentiation markers were elevated on DPI-VTK coated apatite films compared to controls. Taken together, phage display can identify non-obvious cell and material specific peptides to increase human MSC adhesion strength to specific biomaterial surfaces and subsequently increase cell proliferation and differentiation. These new peptides expand biomaterial design methodology for cell-based regeneration of bone defects. This strategy of combining cell and material binding phage display derived peptides is broadly applicable to a variety of systems requiring targeted adhesion of specific cell populations, and may be generalized to the engineering of any adhesion surface.",

        "abstract": "Fully understanding the metabolism of SRB provides fundamental guidelines for allowing the microorganisms to provide more beneficial services in water treatment and resource recovery. The electron-transfer pathway of sulfate respiration by Desulfovibrio vulgaris is well studied, but still partly unresolved. Here we provide deeper insight by comprehensively monitoring metabolite changes during D. vulgaris metabolism with two electron donors, lactate and pyruvate, in presence or absence of citrate-chelated soluble Fe(III) as an additional competing electron acceptor. H(2) was produced from lactate oxidation to pyruvate, but pyruvate oxidation produced mostly formate. Accumulation of lactate-originated H(2) during lag phases inhibited pyruvate transformation to acetate. Sulfate reduction was initiated by lactate-originated H(2), but MQ-mediated e(-) flow initiated sulfate reduction without delay when pyruvate was the donor. When H(2)-induced electron flow gave priority to Fe(III) reduction over sulfate reduction, the long lag phase before sulfate reduction shortened the time for iron-sulfide crystallite growth and led to smaller mackinawite (Fe(1+x)S) nanocrystallites. Synthesizing all the results, we propose that electron flow from lactate or pyruvate towards SO(4)(2-) reduction to H(2)S are through at least three routes that are regulated by the e(-) donor (lactate or pyruvate) and the presence or absence of another e(-) acceptor (Fe(III) here). These routes are not competing, but complementary: e.g., H(2) or formate production and oxidation were necessary for sulfite and disulfide/trisulfide reduction to sulfide. Our study suggests that the e(-) donor provides a practical tool to regulate and optimize SRB-predominant bioremediation systems.",

Both attenuation and lack of protection are because M.tb DK9897 cannot secrete the EsxA virulence factor nor induce a host response against it. Genome sequencing identified a frameshift mutation in the eccCa1 gene. Since the encoded EccCa1 protein provides energy for ESX-1 secretion, it suggested a defect in the ESX-1 type VII secretion system. Genetic complementation with a plasmid carrying the M.tb H37Rv sequence of eccCa1-eccCb1-pe35 re-established EsxA secretion, host specific EsxA T-cell responses, and increased strain virulence. The ESX-1 secretion defect prevents several virulence factors from being functional during infection and therefore attenuates M.tb. It precludes specific T-cell responses against strong antigens and we found very little in vivo cytokine production, gross pathology or granuloma formation in lungs from M.tb DK9897 infected animals. This coincides with M.tb DK9897 being unable to disrupt the phagosome membrane and make contact to the cytosol.",

The current study had participants (N = 90) interact with a same-sex confederate on a modified version of the Tangram Task-our measure of aggressive behavior-for three trials. At each trial, participants completed a measure of aggressive motivations, assigned tangram puzzles for their partner to solve, were provoked (or not) by their ostensible partner, and then completed an assessment of aggressive attributions regarding their partner's behavior. Results showed that, for provoked participants, the relation between Time 1 aggressive attributions predicted Time 3 aggressive behavior through the following temporal mediated pathway: Time 2 aggressive attributions, Time 2 aggressive behavior, and Time 3 aggressive motivations.",

Replication may lead to mild symptoms occurring 5-14 days after MMR-vaccination, including fever, conjunctivitis and rash. Symptoms are comparable to those of a wildtype measles infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with an impressive rash 13 days after MMR-vaccination. Diagnostic tests were positive for measles. This test result caused the mother to doubt further vaccination. CONCLUSION: Within 14 days after MMR-vaccination, a child can present with symptoms very similar to a wildtype measles virus infection. The low incidence of wildtype measles infection strongly suggests that these symptoms will likely be a reaction to vaccination. Elaborate diagnostic procedures may cause the parents a lot of stress and therefore offering reassurance to parents may be more appropriate.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Older adults often show declines in phonological aspects of language production, particularly for low-frequency words, but maintain strong semantic systems. However, there are different theories about the mechanism that may underlie such age-related differences in language (e.g., age-related declines in transmission of activation or inhibition). METHODS: This study used fMRI to investigate whether age-related differences in language production are associated with transmission deficits or inhibition deficits. We used the picture-word interference paradigm to examine age-related differences in picture naming as a function of both target frequency and the relationship between the target picture and distractor word. RESULTS: We found that the presence of a categorically related distractor led to greater semantic elaboration by older adults compared to younger adults, as evidenced by older adults' increased recruitment of regions including the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral precuneus. When presented with a phonologically related distractor, patterns of neural activation are consistent with previously observed age deficits in phonological processing, including age-related reductions in the recruitment of regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus. Lastly, older, but not younger, adults show increased brain activation of the pre- and postcentral gyri as a function of decreasing target frequency when target pictures are paired with a phonological distractor, suggesting that cuing the phonology of the target disproportionately aids production of low-frequency items. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this pattern of results is generally consistent with the transmission deficit hypothesis, illustrating that links within the phonological system, but not the semantic system, are weakened with age.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with an impaired renal function show a high incidence of bone and mineral disturbances. These 'chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders' (CKD-MBD) range from high turnover osteoporosis to adynamic bone disease. Currently, the histomorphometric analysis of a bone biopsy taken from the iliac crest is viewed as the gold standard for CKD-MBD subtype differentiation. However, the clinical relevance of such a biopsy is questionable since iliac crest fractures are an extremely rare finding. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate if the histomorphometric parameter 'trabecular bone volume (BV/TV)' from the iliac crest is representative for other biopsy locations. We chose two skeletal sites of higher fracture risk for testing, namely, the tibial bone and the lumbar spine, to examine if the current gold standard of bone biopsy is indeed golden. METHODS: Bone biopsies were taken from 12 embalmed body donors at the iliac crest, the proximal tibia, and the lumbar vertebral body, respectively. Masson-Goldner stained sections of methyl methacrylate embedded biopsies were used for trabecular bone volume calculation. Furthermore, exemplary mu-computed tomography (XtremeCT) scans with subsequent analysis were performed. RESULTS: Median values of trabecular bone volume were comparable between all body donors with median (interquartile range, IQR) 18.3% (10.9-22.9%) at the iliac crest, 21.5% (9.5-40.1%) at the proximal tibia, and 16.3% (11.4-25.0%) at the lumbar spine. However, single values showed extensive intra-individual variation, which were also confirmed by XtremeCT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct intra-individual heterogeneity of trabecular bone volume elucidate why a bone biopsy from one site does not necessarily predict patient relevant endpoints like hip or spine fractures. Physicians interpreting bone biopsy results should know this limitation of the current gold standard for CKD-MBD diagnostic, especially, when systemic therapeutic decisions should be based on it.",

OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinical presentations of a large, well-phenotyped cohort of women with POI, and correlate phenotypes with etiologies to draw a comprehensive clinical picture of POI. DESIGN, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In this retrospective study, a total of 955 Chinese women with overt POI between 2006 and 2015 were systemically evaluated and analyzed. The phenotypic features, including menstrual characteristics, hormone profiles, ovarian ultrasonography/biopsy, pregnancy/family history, and genetic/autoimmune/iatrogenic etiologies were assessed and further compared within different subgroups. RESULTS: Among 955 women with POI, 85.97% presented with secondary amenorrhea (SA) and 14.03% with primary amenorrhea (PA). PA represented the most severe ovarian dysfunction and more chromosomal aberrations than SA. The decline of ovarian function in patients with SA progressed quickly. They had shortened reproductive periods (approximately 10 years) and developed amenorrhea within 1 to 2 years after menstrual irregularity. The ovaries were invisible or small, and the presence of follicles (28.43%) was correlated with other good reproductive indicators. Familial patients (12.25%) manifested better ovarian status and fewer chromosomal aberrations than sporadic patients. The etiologies consisted of genetic (13.15%), autoimmune (12.04%), and iatrogenic (7.29%), approximately 68% remaining idiopathic. There were significant differences among different etiologies, with the genetic group representing the most severe phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our results regarding distinct phenotypic characteristics and association with different etiologies further confirmed the high heterogeneity of POI. Additional longitudinal clinical studies and pathogenesis research are warranted.",

Correlational analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We found weak-to-moderate correlations between the measures, except for verbal comprehension. The indices of overall performance showed more consistent correlations than Subtests. DISCUSSION: The overall correlations were in accordance with earlier studies. Cogstate is relatively independent of verbal comprehension abilities. The choice of the cognitive assessment method should be strongly guided by the research question.

Although it is known that deviations from stoichiometry are a prerequisite for plasmonic activity in the near-infrared, an accurate description of the material and its (optical) properties is hindered by an insufficient understanding of the atomic structure and the influence of defects, especially for materials in their nanocrystalline form. We demonstrate that the structure of Cu(1.5+/-x)Te nanocrystals can be determined using electron diffraction tomography. Real-space high-resolution electron tomography directly reveals the three-dimensional distribution of vacancies in the structure. Through first-principles density functional theory, we furthermore demonstrate that the influence of these vacancies on the optical properties of the nanocrystals is determined. Since our methodology is applicable to a variety of crystalline nanostructured materials, it is expected to provide unique insights concerning structure-property correlations.",

However, regulatory role of NPY in relation to brain ontogeny and recrudescence with reference to reproduction is less understood in fish. Present report for the first time evaluated the significance of NPY by transient esiRNA silencing and also analyzed its expression during brain development and gonadal recrudescence in the catfish, Clarias gariepinus. As a first step, full-length cDNA of NPY was cloned from adult catfish brain, which shared high homology with its counterparts from other teleosts upon phylogenetic analysis. Tissue distribution revealed dominant expression of NPY in brain and testis. NPY expression increased during brain development wherein the levels were higher in 100 and 150days post hatch females than the respective age-matched males. Seasonal cycle analysis showed high expression of NPY in brain during pre-spawning phase in comparison with other reproductive phases. Localization studies exhibited the presence of NPY, abundantly, in the regions of preoptic area, hypothalamus and pituitary. Transient silencing of NPY-esiRNA directly into the brain significantly decreased NPY expression in both the male and female brain of catfish which further resulted in significant decrease of transcripts of tryptophan hydroxylase 2, catfish gonadotropin-releasing hormone (cfGnRH), tyrosine hydroxylase and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in brain and luteinizing hormone-beta/gonadotropin-II (lh-beta/GTH-II) in pituitary exhibiting its influence on gonadal axis. In addition, significant decrease of several ovary-related transcripts was observed in NPY-esiRNA silenced female catfish, indicating the plausible role of NPY in ovary through cfGnRH-GTH axis.",

There are currently no therapies to directly inhibit hepatic fibrosis. We developed a small molecule screen to identify compounds that inactivate human HSC myofibroblasts through the quantification of lipid droplets. We screened 1600 compounds and identified 21 small molecules that induce HSC inactivation. Four hits were tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and they repressed expression of pro-fibrotic factors Alpha-Actin-2 (ACTA2) and Alpha-1 Type I Collagen (COL1A1) in HSCs. RNA sequencing implicated the sphingolipid pathway as a target of the TCAs. Indeed, TCA treatment of HSCs promoted accumulation of ceramide through inhibition of acid ceramidase (aCDase). Depletion of aCDase also promoted accumulation of ceramide and was associated with reduced COL1A1 expression. Treatment with B13, an inhibitor of aCDase, reproduced the antifibrotic phenotype as did the addition of exogenous ceramide. Our results show that detection of lipid droplets provides a robust readout to screen for regulators of hepatic fibrosis and have identified a novel antifibrotic role for ceramide.",

The NSF, though useful in reconstruction, may lead to significant donor site morbidity. Published techniques to reduce the donor site morbidity, free mucosal grafts, and septal rotational flaps have shown to reduce crusting and remucosalization times. We present a novel technique utilizing posterior septal mucosa as a free mucosal graft for reconstruction of the anterior septal donor site. The septal mucosal graft is taken from the mucosa overlying the posterior septectomy site of the endonasal approach to skull base tumors. Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Single tertiary academic medical center. Participants All patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal skull-base surgery between November 1, 2014 and August 30, 2015 with free mucosal graft reconstruction of the NSF donor site. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative graft success. Results Fifteen patients underwent septal reconstruction using a septal free mucosal graft. There was a 100% graft success rate with near complete remucosalization by 6 weeks postoperatively. Conclusions The posterior septal free mucosal graft is a simple, reliable method for reconstructing the NSF donor site. The advantages of this technique include utilization of native septal mucosal tissue and middle turbinate preservation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly used to help patients cope with physical and mental long-term conditions (LTCs). Epilepsy is associated with a range of mental and physical comorbidities that have a detrimental effect on quality of life (QOL), but it is not clear whether MBIs can help. We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the effectiveness of MBIs in people with epilepsy. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, and PsychInfo were searched in March 2016. These databases were searched using a combination of subject headings where available and keywords in the title and abstracts. We also searched the reference lists of related reviews. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 231 participants were included. The interventions were tested in the USA (n = 171) and China (Hong Kong) (n = 60). Significant improvements were reported in depression symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression knowledge and skills. Two of the included studies were assessed as being at unclear/high risk of bias - with randomisation and allocation procedures, as well as adverse events and reasons for drop-outs poorly reported. There was no reporting on intervention costs/benefits or how they affected health service utilisation. CONCLUSION: This systematic review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of MBIs in epilepsy, however preliminary evidence suggests it may lead to some improvement in anxiety, depression and quality of life. Further trials with larger sample sizes, active control groups and longer follow-ups are needed before the evidence for MBIs in epilepsy can be conclusively determined.",

        "abstract": "Background. The etiology of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in AIDS patients after the initiation of HAART remains unknown. Several researches indicated that the development of IRIS is associated with the production and variation of cytokines, whose gene expression are closely related to the Ca2(+)/CN-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. Methods. We studied the expression of NFAT isoforms and their major target cytokines genes in peripheral blood CD3(+) T cells of subjects through fluorescence quantitative PCR and explored the expression changes of these genes before and after HAART. Results. After the initiation of HARRT, NFAT1, IL-6, and IL-8 gene expression showed a reversal trend in the CD3(+) T cells of the IRIS group and changed from low expression before HARRT to high expression after HARRT. In particular, the relative gene expression of NFAT1 was markedly higher compared with the other three isoforms. The IRIS group also showed higher NFAT4, NFAT2, NFAT1, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-2, IL-18, and TNF-alpha gene expression than the non-IRIS group. Conclusion. This study suggested that high expression levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 can predict the risk of IRIS. The increased expression of NFAT1 and NFAT4 may promote the expression of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha, which may promote the occurrence of IRIS.",

Variable phenotypes have been associated with these mutations, and some of these were linked to the effects they have on the interacting partners of VDR, mainly the retinoic X receptor (RXR). METHODS: We examined four patients with HVDRR from three unrelated Lebanese families. All parents were consanguineous with normal phenotype. We used Sanger sequencing to identify mutations in the coding exons of VDR. RESULTS: Two homozygous mutations (p.R391S and p.H397P), both in exon 9 of the VDR gene, were identified. Phenotype/genotype association was not possible even for the same mutation. Alopecia was seen only with the p.R391S mutation. Despite a comparable rachitic bone disease, the patients showed different responsiveness to large doses of alfacalcidol (1-alpha-hydroxy vitamin D3) supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of VDR mutations in Lebanon with promising clinical outcomes despite the severity of the phenotypes.",

In the middle third, the clavicle had three areas with losses of substance in the form of oval-shaped foramina with maximum diameters of 1-2 cm that were located in the anterior and superior surfaces of the diaphysis. The margins of these foramina were well defined and rounded, and the surfaces of the canal walls were smooth. Additionally, there were no zones of bony activity or reactive changes around the foramina. This new congenital anomaly of the clavicle and blood vessels is consistent with a variant that might have originated during fetal growth in which the subclavian vein or artery remained included during the process of ossification of the clavicle.

It is generally agreed that the aggregation number (N(agg)) for spherical micelles has no exact value and a certain distribution. However, our studies of calix[4]arene surfactants showed that they were monodisperse with a defined N(agg) whose values are chosen from 6, 8, 12, 20, and 32. Interestingly, some of these numbers coincide with the face numbers of Platonic solids, thus we named them \"Platonic micelles\". The preferred N(agg) values were explained in relation to the mathematical Tammes problem: how to obtain the best coverage of a sphere surface with multiple identical circles.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dimensions of acromion process are important to show linkage to the shoulder girdle pathologies. Also morphometric analysis of acromion process would be helpful for surgeons while performing surgical procedures on the shoulder joint. AIM: The purpose of this present study was to observe the detailed morphometric evaluation of adult acromion processes in North Indian population because different morphometric dimensions play an important role in various disorders of the shoulder, particularly sub acromial impingement syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred adult dry scapulae from the osteology museum of MAMC, New Delhi, were obtained for evaluation of various measurement of acromion process. The length, width, thickness of acromion, coraco-acromial (C-A) distance and acromio-glenoid (Ac-g) distance were measured. The measurements were compared with other osteological studies performed on different population group. Data was analysed using SPSS version 12.0 and mean values with standard deviation for each dimension were presented. RESULTS: The mean values of each measurement were: length: 41.007 mm; width: 21.82 mm; thickness: 6.58 mm; C-A distance: 28.34 mm and Ac-g distance: 26.21 mm. CONCLUSION: It is expected that various dimensions of adult acromion process will serve as a reference base and will assist the surgeon in the approach to be used and precision of the operative technique. So, the study will provide a vital support for planning and executing acromioplasty in the treatment of impingement syndrome.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of pain, masticatory dysfunction and trigeminal somatosensory abnormalities in patients who acquired aneurysms following pterional craniotomy. METHODS: Fifteen patients were evaluated before and after the surgical procedure by a trained dentist. The evaluation consisted of the (1) research diagnostic criteria for TMD, (2) a standardized orofacial pain questionnaire and (3) a systematic protocol for quantitative sensory testing (QST) for the trigeminal nerve. RESULTS: After pterional craniotomy, 80% of the subjects, 12 patients, developed orofacial pain triggered by mandibular function. The pain intensity was measured by using the visual analog scale (VAS), and the mean pain intensity was 3.7. The prevalence of masticatory dysfunction was 86.7%, and there was a significant reduction of the maximum mouth opening. The sensory evaluation showed tactile and thermal hypoesthesia in the area of pterional access in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high frequency of temporomandibular dysfunction, postoperative orofacial pain and trigeminal sensory abnormalities. These findings can help to understand several abnormalities that can contribute to postoperative headache or orofacial pain complaints after pterional surgeries.",

Conjugation of a chloramphenicol-specific DNA aptamer to the protein shell through strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition and spontaneous concentration of the resulting nanostructures onto SiO(2) particles mediated by the silica-binding sequence enables visual detection of environmentally and clinically relevant concentrations of chloramphenicol through analyte-mediated inner filtering of sub-330 nm excitation light.",

Simulations of this system suggest that it will pave the way toward the long-sought goal of true atom imaging on the nanoscale. Using a prototype lens with a supersonic beam of metastable neon, we have imaged complex patterns with lower distortion and higher resolution than has been shown in any previous experiment.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychiatry has faced significant criticism for overreliance on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and medications with purported disregard for empathetic, humanistic interventions. AIMS: To develop an empirically based qualitative theory explaining how psychiatrists use empathy in day-to-day practice, to inform practice and teaching approaches. METHOD: This study used constructivist grounded theory methodology to ask (a) 'How do psychiatrists understand and use empathetic engagement in the day-to-day practice of psychiatry?' and (b) 'How do psychiatrists learn and teach the skills of empathetic engagement?' The authors interviewed 17 academic psychiatrists and 4 residents and developed a theory by iterative coding of the collected data. RESULTS: This constructivist grounded theory of empathetic engagement in psychiatric practice considered three major elements: relational empathy, transactional empathy and instrumental empathy. As one moves from relational empathy through transactional empathy to instrumental empathy, the actions of the psychiatrist become more deliberate and interventional. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were described by empathy-based interventions which are presented in a theory of 'empathetic engagement'. This is in contrast to a paradigm that sees psychiatry as purely based on neurobiological interventions, with psychotherapy and interpersonal interventions as completely separate activities from day-to-day psychiatric practice.

        "abstract": "Type B trichothecenes, which pose a serious hazard to consumer health, occur worldwide in grains. These mycotoxins are produced mainly by three different trichothecene genotypes/chemotypes: 3ADON (3-acetyldeoxynivalenol), 15ADON (15-acetyldeoxynivalenol) and NIV (nivalenol), named after these three major mycotoxin compounds. Correct identification of these genotypes is elementary for all studies relating to population surveys, fungal ecology and mycotoxicology. Trichothecene producers exhibit enormous strain-dependent chemical diversity, which may result in variation in levels of the genotype's determining toxin and in the production of low to high amounts of atypical compounds. New high-throughput DNA-sequencing technologies promise to boost the diagnostics of mycotoxin genotypes. However, this requires a reference database containing a satisfactory taxonomic sampling of sequences showing high correlation to actually produced chemotypes. We believe that one of the most pressing current challenges of such a database is the linking of molecular identification with chemical diversity of the strains, as well as other metadata. In this study, we use the Tri12 gene involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis for identification of Tri genotypes through sequence comparison. Tri12 sequences from a range of geographically diverse fungal strains comprising 22 Fusarium species were stored in the ToxGen database, which covers descriptive and up-to-date annotations such as indication on Tri genotype and chemotype of the strains, chemical diversity, information on trichothecene-inducing host, substrate or media, geographical locality, and most recent taxonomic affiliations. The present initiative bridges the gap between the demands of comprehensive studies on trichothecene producers and the existing nucleotide sequence databases, which lack toxicological and other auxiliary data. We invite researchers working in the fields of fungal taxonomy, epidemiology and mycotoxicology to join the freely available annotation effort.",

It is the equivalent of a traditional public oral health prevention and screening program, with the additional dimension of allowing dental hygienists and assistants to place interim glass ionomer restorations in dental cavities. The critique questions the need to insert a \"cloud\" dentist into the process. The routine utilization of radiographs is also challenged. The VDH not only lacks the attributes of a dental home, it has not been shown to be as efficient and effective as traditional programs staffed by dental hygienists and dental therapists.

Schrad (fruit, seed and pulp) extracts as bio-fuels is reported. The structure, optical, and colloidal properties of the synthesized ZnO-NP samples were studied. Results illustrate that the morphology and particle size of the ZnO samples are different and depend on the bio-fuel. The XRD results revealed that hexagonal wurtzite ZnO-NPs with mean particle size of 27-85 nm were produced by different bio-fuels. The optical band gap was increased from 3.25 to 3.40 eV with the decreasing of particle size. FTIR results showed some differences in the surface structures of the as-synthesized ZnO-NP samples. This led to differences in the zeta potential, hydrodynamic size, and more significantly, antioxidant activity through scavenging of 1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals. In in vitro cytotoxicity studies on 3T3 cells, a dose dependent toxicity with non-toxic effect of concentration below 0.26 mg/mL was shown for ZnO-NP samples. Furthermore, the as-synthesized ZnO-NPs inhibited the growth of medically significant pathogenic gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aurous) and gram-negative (Peseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) bacteria. This study provides a simple, green and efficient approach to produce ZnO nanoparticles for various applications.",

The molecules exhibit excellent selectivity and display efficacy in a SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS. Interestingly, the molecules appear to act as agonists for the receptor in certain surrogate cellular assays. While the exact mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of the new agonists remain to be elucidated, we believe that the described agent represents both an invaluable pharmacological tool to further decipher the role of the EphA4 in ALS and potentially other human diseases, and a significant stepping stone for the development of novel treatments.",

        "abstract": "A hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is accumulation of protein-rich edema in the distal airspaces and its removal is critical for patient survival. Previous studies have shown a detrimental role of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK) 3beta during ARDS via inhibition of alveolar epithelial protein transport. We hypothesized that post-transcriptional regulation of GSK3beta could play a functional role in ARDS resolution. To address this hypothesis, we performed an in silico analysis to identify regulatory genes whose expression correlation to GSK3beta messenger RNA utilizing two lung cancer cell line array datasets. Among potential regulatory partners of GSK3beta, these studies identified the RNA-binding protein ELAVL-1/HuR (Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision, Drosophila-Like) as a central component in a likely GSK3beta signaling network. ELAVL-1/HuR is a RNA-binding protein that selectively binds to AU-rich elements of mRNA and enhances its stability thereby increasing target gene expression. Subsequent studies with siRNA suppression of ELAVL-1/HuR demonstrated deceased GSK3beta mRNA and protein expression and improved clearance of FITC-albumin in A549 cells. Conversely, stabilization of ELAVL-1/HuR with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 resulted in induction of GSK3beta at mRNA and protein level and attenuated FITC-albumin clearance. Utilizing ventilator-induced lung injury or intra-tracheal installation of hydrochloric acid to induce ARDS in mice, we observed increased mRNA and protein expression of ELAVL-1/HuR and GSK3beta. Together, our findings indicate a previously unknown interaction between GSK3beta and ELAV-1 during ARDS, and suggest the inhibition of the ELAV-1- GSK3beta pathways as a novel ARDS treatment approach."

The print material was characterized using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and spectroscopic techniques such as infrared and Raman. Preliminary studies included the separation of colored dyes, whereby the separation performance could be visualized optically. Subsequent separations were achieved using fluorescent dyes and fluorescently tagged proteins.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several aggregate data meta-analyses have provided estimates of the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in community-dwelling elderly people. However, these studies ignored the effects of patient-level confounders such as sex, age, and chronic diseases that could bias effectiveness estimates. We aimed to assess the confounder-adjusted effectiveness of influenza vaccines on laboratory-confirmed influenza among elderly people by conducting a global individual participant data meta-analysis. METHODS: In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we considered studies included in a previously conducted aggregate data meta-analysis that included test-negative design case-control studies published up to July 13, 2014. We contacted all authors of the included studies on Dec 1, 2014, to request individual participant data. Patients were excluded if their unique identifier was missing, their vaccination status was unknown, their outcome status was unknown, or they had had suspected influenza infection more than once in the same influenza season. Cases were patients with influenza-like illness symptoms who tested positive for at least one of A H1N1, A H1N1 pdm09, A H3N2, or B viruses; controls were patients with influenza-like illness symptoms who tested negative for these virus types or subtypes. Influenza vaccine effectiveness against overall and subtype-specific laboratory-confirmed influenza were the primary and secondary outcomes. We used a generalised linear mixed model to calculate adjusted vaccine effectiveness according to vaccine match to the circulating strains of influenza virus and intensity of the virus activity (epidemic or non-epidemic). Vaccine effectiveness was defined as the relative reduction in risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza in vaccinated patients compared with unvaccinated patients. We did subgroup analyses to estimate vaccine effectiveness according to hemisphere, age category, and health status. FINDINGS: We received 23 of the 53 datasets included in the aggregate data meta-analysis. Furthermore, six additional datasets were provided by data collaborators, which resulted in individual participant data for a total of 5210 participants. A total of 4975 patients had the required data for analysis. Of these, 3146 (63%) were controls and 1829 (37%) were cases. Influenza vaccination was significantly effective during epidemic seasons irrespective of vaccine match status (matched adjusted vaccine effectiveness 44.38%, 95% CI 22.63-60.01; mismatched adjusted vaccine effectiveness 20.00%, 95% CI 3.46-33.68; analyses in the imputed dataset). Seasonal influenza vaccination did not show significant effectiveness during non-epidemic seasons. We found substantial variation in vaccine effectiveness across virus types and subtypes, with the highest estimate for A H1N1 pdm09 (53.19%, 10.25-75.58) and the lowest estimate for B virus types (-1.52%, -39.58 to 26.16). Although we observed no significant differences between subgroups in each category (hemisphere, age, and health status), influenza vaccination showed a protective effect among elderly people with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or aged 75 years and younger. INTERPRETATION: Influenza vaccination is moderately effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza in elderly people during epidemic seasons. More research is needed to investigate factors affecting vaccine protection (eg, brand-specific or type-specific vaccine effectiveness and repeated annual vaccination) in elderly people.

In this study, we established a rat model of varying OSA with different grades of CIH (12.5% O(2), 10% O(2), 7.5% O(2), and 5% O(2)) for 12 weeks, and found that CIH stimulated insulin secretion, reduced the insulin:proinsulin ratio in pancreatic tissue, and caused pancreatic tissue lesions and cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CIH promoted the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6, and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38, depending on the O(2) concentration. In summary, CIH disturbed insulin secretion, and caused inflammation, lesions, and cell apoptosis in pancreatic tissue via the MAPK signaling pathway, which may be of great significance for clinical treatment of OSA and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",

        "abstract": "Liposomes have come a long way since their conception in the 1960s, when they were envisioned primarily for drug delivery. Besides serving the important function of the delivery of a variety of drugs, liposomes offer a platform for the co-delivery of a range of therapeutic and diagnostic agents with different physicochemical properties. They are also amenable to the addition of various targeting moieties such as proteins, sugars, and antibodies for selective targeting at a desired site, including tumors. Currently, the design of stimuli-sensitive liposomes for drug delivery is a lively area of research. Compared to conventional liposomes, stimuli-sensitive nanoplatforms respond to local conditions that are characteristics of the pathological area of interest, allowing the release of active agents at the targeted site. Acidic pH, abnormal levels of enzymes, temperature, altered redox potential, and external magnetic field are examples of internal and external stimuli exploited in the design of stimuli-sensitive liposomes. The penetration of the liposomes into the cells can be enhanced with the help of a variety of cell penetrating peptides, which can be incorporated into the liposomes with the help of various lipid-polymer conjugates. Liposomes are now being employed in diagnostics as well. Imaging of a tumor can be made easier by the inclusion of fluorescent probes. They can also be used for gamma or MR imaging using chelated reporter metals and incorporating them either into the core of the liposome or in the lipid bilayer facing outwards. In this chapter, we discuss methods that are commonly used for the preparation of liposomes with a vast range of functions to meet a variety of needs in diagnostics and drug delivery.",

The intention of this study was to evaluate the effect of the reactive additives sodium sulfite, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and urea on the oxygen barrier, water vapor barrier, and protein solubility of whey protein cast films. The concentration of the reactive additives was 1 to 20 wt.-%. Dried whey protein cast films were used as substrate materials. The water vapor transmission rate, the oxygen permeability, and the protein solubility were measured. Effective diffusion coefficients and effective sorption coefficients were calculated from the results of the water vapor sorption experiments. The presence of sodium sulfite resulted in an increased number of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds and a slightly decreased number of disulfide bonds. The oxygen permeability decreased from 68 to 46 cm(3) (STP/standard temperature and pressure) 100 mum (m(2) d bar)(-1) for 1 wt.-% SDS in the whey protein cast film. The water vapor transmission rate decreased from 165 to 44 g 100 mum (m(2) d)(-1) measured at 50 to 0% r. h. for 20 wt.-% SDS in the whey protein cast film. The reduction in the water vapor transmission rate correlated with the lower effective diffusion coefficient.",

Thirty-five patients presenting with cervical dilatation and prolapsed foetal membranes were included in the study. A McDonald cerclage was placed in 27 patients. The duration of pregnancy prolongation and the number of deliveries after 28 weeks were evaluated. The median prolongation of pregnancy after cerclage placement differed significantly between the cerclage and bed-rest groups (64 days versus 13.5 days). Of the 27 patients who had cerclage, 17 (63%) delivered after 28 weeks of gestation, whereas all patients in the bed-rest group delivered before 28 weeks of gestation. The take-home baby rate was 63% in the cerclage group. When pregnancies were complicated by cervical dilatation with membrane prolapse into the vagina, placement of a McDonald cerclage in appropriately selected patients can be a beneficial therapeutic option. Impact statement Although the effectiveness and safety of rescue cerclage is controversial, our study provides strong support for the notion that cervical cerclage accompanied by long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics improves the perinatal outcomes in singleton gestations with membrane prolapsed into the vagina. Further prospective randomised trial is required to prove these findings.",

Our aim was to assess any prepro-GRP role as a prognostic factor for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and NSCLC and correlations with clinical presentation and treatment outcome. Methods: A prospective study was conducted during the time period from the beginning of January 2012 till the end of January 2014. Prepro-GRP expression was analysed using a nested RT-PCR assay in peripheral blood of 62 untreated lung cancer patients attending the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University, and 30 age and sex matched healthy volunteers. Results: Among the 62 lung cancer cases, there were 24 (38.7%) SCLC, and 38 (61.3%) NSCLC (10 squamous cell carcinomas, 12 adenocarcinomas, 11 large cell carcinomas, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas, and 1 adenosquamous carcinoma). Twenty six patients (41.9%) were prepro-GRP positive. Prepro-GRP expression was higher (58.3%) among SCLC patients compared to NSCLC (squamous cell carcinoma (15.4%), large cell carcinoma (36.4%), and adenocarcinoma (25%)). Mean OS among prepro-GRP negative cases was longer than that among preprogastrin positive cases (17.6 vs 14.9 months). The mean PFS durations among preprogastrin negative versus positive cases were 7.7 vs 4.6 months (p= 0.041). No difference in response to chemotherapy was identified between the groups (p=0.983). Conclusion: Prepro-GRP is suggested to be a useful prognostic marker for lung cancer patients, especially with the fast- growing, bad prognostic SCLC type. More studies should aim at detailed understanding of the mechanisms of prepro-GRP action and its use in monitoring the response to treatment in a larger cohort.",

The Suction-Assisted Laryngoscopy Assisted Decontamination (SALAD) simulation system trains providers to use suction to manage emesis and bleeding complicating intubation. METHODS: We modified a standard difficult-airway mannequin head (Nasco, Ft. Atkinson, WI) with hardware-store equipment to enable simulation of vomiting or hemorrhage during intubation. A pre- and post-survey was used to assess the effectiveness of the SALAD simulator. We used a 1-5 Likert scale to assess confidence in managing the airway of a vomiting patient and comfort with suction techniques before and after the training exercise. RESULTS: Forty learners participated in the simulation, including emergency physicians, anesthesiologists, paramedics, respiratory therapists, and registered nurses. The average Likert score of confidence in managing the airway of a vomiting or hemorrhaging patient pre-session was 3.10+/-0.49, and post-session 4.13+/-0.22. The average score of self-perceived skill with suction techniques in the airway scenario pre-session was 3.30+/-0.43, and post-session 4.03+/-0.26. The average score for usefulness of the session was 4.68+/-0.15, and the score for realism of the simulator was 4.65+/-0.17. CONCLUSION: A training session with the SALAD simulator improved trainee's confidence in managing the airway of a vomiting or hemorrhaging patient. The SALAD simulation system recreates the dynamic challenges associated with emergency airways and holds promise as an airway training tool.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of primary care patients who report a family history (FH) of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer (CRC); assess concordance of FH information derived from the electronic medical record (EMR) compared with patient-completed health questionnaires; and assess whether appropriate screening was informed by risk based solely on FH. DESIGN: Data from the BETTER (Building on Existing Tools to Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Primary Care) trial were used. Patients were mailed questionnaires. Baseline FH and screening data were obtained for enrolled patients from the EMR and health questionnaires. SETTING: Ontario and Alberta. PARTICIPANTS: Randomly selected patients from 8 family practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement on FH between the EMR and questionnaire was determined; logistic regression was used to assess significant predictors of screening. RESULTS: In total, 775 of 789 (98%) patients completed the health questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 52.5 years and 72% were female. A minimum of 12% of patients (range 12% to 36%) had a reported FH of 1 of 4 chronic diseases. Among patients with positive FH, the following proportions of patients had that FH recorded in the EMR compared with the questionnaire: diabetes, 24% in the EMR versus 36% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.466; coronary artery disease, 35% in the EMR versus 22% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.225; breast cancer, 21% in the EMR versus 22% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.241; and CRC, 12% in the EMR versus 14% on the questionnaire, kappa = 0.510. There was moderate agreement for diabetes and CRC. The presence of FH was a significant predictor of CRC screening (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1). CONCLUSION: A moderate prevalence of FH was found for 4 conditions for which screening recommendations vary with risk based on FH. Having patients self-complete an FH was thought to be feasible; however, questions about FH accuracy and completeness from both self-report and EMR remain. Work is needed to determine how to facilitate the adoption of FH tools into practice as well as strategies linking familial risk to appropriate screening.Trial registration number ISRCTN07170460 (ISRCTN Registry).",

        "abstract": "Sodium fluoride (NaF) is a source of fluoride ions used in many applications. Previous studies found that NaF suppressed the proliferation of osteoblast MC3T3 E1 cells and induced the apoptosis of chondrocytes. However, little is known about the effects of NaF on human lung BEAS-2B cells. Therefore, we investigated the mode of cell death induced by NaF and its underlying molecular mechanisms. BEAS-2B cells were treated with NaF at concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mmol/L. Cell viability decreased and apoptotic cells significantly increased as concentrations of NaF increased over specific periods of time. The IC(50) of NaF was 1.9 and 0.9 mM after 24 and 48 h, respectively. The rates of apoptosis increased from 4.8 to 37.7% after NaF exposure. HE staining, electron microscopy, and single cell gel electrophoresis revealed that morphological changes of apoptosis increased with exposure concentrations. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the apoptotic pathways. The expressions of bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, p53, and the cytoplasmic CytC of the NaF groups increased, while bcl-2 and mitochondrial CytC decreased compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). Further, the fluorescence intensities of ROS in the NaF groups were higher than those in the control group, and the membrane potential of mitochondria in the NaF group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that NaF induced apoptosis in the BEAS-2B cells through mitochondria-mediated signal pathways. Our study provides the theoretical foundation and experimental basis for exploring the mechanisms of human lung epithelial cell damage and cytotoxicity induced by fluorine.",

Through catalyzing the oxidization of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H(2)O(2), the Fe-N-CDs exhibited a superior catalytic performance over horseradish peroxidase (HRP), suggesting their potential applications in catalytic area. Furthermore, the Fe-N-CDs were coupled to antibody as the biocatalyst instead of HRP (commonly used in enzyme-linked immunosorbnent assay (ELISA)). Results of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) determination demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, a detection limit as low as 0.1pg/mL within 5min has been achieved.

METHODS: The in vitro activity of ceftazidime/avibactam was evaluated against 840 Gram-negative pathogens isolated at baseline from 1033 randomized patients in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. The trials were conducted in 160 institutions from 25 countries worldwide. Susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution at a central laboratory according to CLSI methodologies. RESULTS: Overall, ceftazidime/avibactam showed significant activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC 90 values of 0.5 and 8 mg/L, respectively. Against the most common Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 90 values were 0.25 mg/L for Escherichia coli , 1 mg/L for Klebsiella pneumoniae , 0.06 mg/L for Proteus mirabilis and 2 mg/L for Enterobacter cloacae . The ceftazidime/avibactam MIC 90 for 154 ceftazidime-non-susceptible isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was 1 mg/L and the ceftazidime/avibactam MIC 90 for 15 non-susceptible isolates of P. aeruginosa was 64 mg/L. There was a significant reduction in the ceftazidime/avibactam MIC relative to ceftazidime alone for most of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro activity against these clinical urinary tract isolates demonstrates the potential utility of the drug in complicated urinary tract infections.",

Simeprevir, given for 12 weeks as part of a 24- or 48-week combination regimen with PR is approved for the treatment of chronic HCV GT4 infection. Primary study objectives were assessment of efficacy and safety of simeprevir plus PR in treatment-naive patients with HCV GT4 treated for 12 weeks. Primary efficacy outcome was sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Additional objectives included investigation of potential associations of rapid virologic response and baseline factors with SVR12. METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, single-arm study (NCT01846832) evaluated efficacy and safety of simeprevir plus PR in 67 patients with HCV GT4 infection. Patients were treatment-naive, aged 18-70 years with METAVIR F0-F2 fibrosis. Patients with early virologic response (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL [detectable/undetectable in IL28B CC patients or undetectable in IL28B CT/TT patients] at Week 2 and undetectable at Weeks 4 and 8) were eligible to stop all treatment at the end of Week 12, otherwise PR therapy was continued to Week 24. RESULTS: Of 67 patients treated, 34 (51%) qualified for 12-week treatment including all but one patient with IL28B CC genotype (14/15). All patients in the 12-week group had undetectable HCV RNA at end of treatment, and 97% (33/34) achieved SVR12. No new safety signals with simeprevir plus PR were identified. The proportion of patients experiencing Grade 3-4 adverse events was lower in the 12-week group than in the 24-week group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on simeprevir plus PR therapy shortened to 12 weeks in patients with HCV GT4 infection with favourable baseline characteristics and displaying early on-treatment virologic response are encouraging. No new safety signals were associated with simeprevir plus PR in this study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01846832.",

She presented with muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea since one week. The initial diagnosis was TPP. However, biochemistry tests showed hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis and renal potassium wasting. Moreover, a suppressed plasma renin level and a high plasma aldosterone level were noted, which was suggestive of primary aldosteronism. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed this diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, it is imperative to consider other causes of hypokalemia (apart from TPP) in a patient with hyperthyroidism but with renal potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis.

We compared resting-state functional networks between 46 MTLE (right MTLE=23; left MTLE=23) patients with histologically proven HS who were free of seizure after surgery, and 46 HC. The optimal SVM group classifier distinguished MTLE patients with a mean accuracy of 95.1% (sensitivity=95.8%; specificity=94.3%). Increased connectivity including the right posterior cingulate gyrus and decreased connectivity including at least one sensory-related resting-state network were key features reflecting the differences between MTLE patients and HC. The optimal SVM model distinguished between right and left MTLE patients with a mean accuracy of 76.2% (sensitivity=76.0%; specificity=76.5%).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Upfront screening for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency in patients scheduled for 5-FU should help reduce the risk of toxicities by preventive adaptive dosing. Our group has developed a simple functional testing categorizing patients upon their DPD status, i.e. extensive metabolizer (EM) or poor metabolizer (PM) patients, using UH2/U ratio measurement in plasma as a surrogate for DPD activity. 5-FU dosing can then be tailored according to DPD deficiency status. OBJECTIVES: We present here an observational study of this strategy implemented in routine clinical practice when treating head-and-neck cancer patients. RESULTS: A total of 218 evaluable adult patients were treated with a 5-FU-regimen, with DPD-based adaptive dosing. Among them, 20 (9%) were identified as PM and received subsequently a 20-50% reduced dosing of 5-FU as compared with EM patients (2102 +/-254 mg VS. 2577 +/-353mg, p<0.001 ttest). Gender (Female) was associated with higher risk for being PM (p=0.01, Pearson's Chi squared test). Overall, early severe toxicities were seen only in 5% of patients, all being EM with standard dosing. Similarly, overall severe toxicities were observed in 12.8% of patients only, both figures being markedly lower than usually reported with standard 5-FU. Despite the average -20% reduction in 5-FU dosing between PM and EM patients, clinical efficacy was not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.2774, chi-square test). CONCLUSION: This study shows that 5-FU-related toxicities can be greatly reduced in routine clinical practice by the upfront detection of DPD deficient patients with simple adaptive dosing strategy.",

        "abstract": "Gene alterations are a well-established mechanism leading to drug resistance in acute leukemia cells. A full understanding of the mechanisms of drug resistance in these cells will facilitate more effective chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated the mechanism(s) of drug resistance in the human acute leukemia cell line MOLT-3 and its idarubicin-resistant derivative MOLT-3/IDR through complete mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses. We identified genetic differences between these two cell lines. The ND3 mutation site (p.Thr61Ile) in the mitochondrial DNA sequence was unique to MOLT-3/IDR cells. Moreover, we identified five candidate genes harboring genetic alterations, including GALNT2, via CGH array analysis. Sequencing of the GALNT2 exon revealed a G1716K mutation present within the stop codon in MOLT-3/IDR cells but absent from MOLT-3 cells. This mutation led to an additional 18 amino acids in the protein encoded by GALNT2. Using real-time PCR, we determined an expression value for this gene of 0.35. Protein structure predictions confirmed a structural change in GALNT2 in MOLT-3/IDR cells that corresponded to the site of the mutation. We speculate that this mutation may be related to idarubicin resistance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of omeprazole or pantoprazole on platelet reactivity in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients receiving clopidogrel. METHODS: Consecutive patients with NSTE-ACS (n = 620) from general hospital of Shenyang Military Command were randomized to the omeprazole or pantoprazole (20 mg/d) group (1:1), and received routine dual antiplatelet treatment. Patients' reversion rate of adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation (ADP-PA) was assessed at baseline, 12 to 24 h after administration of medication, and after 72 h of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary endpoint of the study was platelet reactivity assessed with ADP-PA at 30 days after PCI. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded for 30-day and 180-day follow-up periods. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between both the groups in platelet response to clopidogrel at 12-24 h after drug administration (54.09% +/- 18.90% vs 51.62% +/- 19.85%, P = 0.12), 72 h after PCI (52.15% +/- 19.45% vs 49.66% +/- 20.05%, P = 0.18), and 30 days after PCI (50.44% +/- 14.54% vs 48.52% +/- 15.08%, P = 0.17). The rate of AEs did not differ significantly between groups during the 30-day (15.2% vs 14.8%, P = 0.91) and 180-day (16.5% vs 14.5%, P = 0.50) follow-up periods after PCI. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of omeprazole or pantoprazole to clopidogrel did not restrict the effect of platelet aggregation by reducing the conversion of clopidogrel. Compared with clopidogrel alone, pantoprazole-clopidogrel and omeprazole-clopidogrel combinations did not increase the incidence of adverse clinical events during 30-day and 180-day follow-up periods after PCI.

In such regions the majority of deaths occur outside hospitals and are not recorded. Worldwide, fewer than one-third of deaths are assigned a cause, with the least information available from the most impoverished nations. In populations like this, verbal autopsy (VA) is a commonly used tool to assess cause of death and estimate cause-specific mortality rates and the distribution of deaths by cause. VA uses an interview with caregivers of the decedent to elicit data describing the signs and symptoms leading up to the death. This paper develops a new statistical tool known as InSilicoVA to classify cause of death using information acquired through VA. InSilicoVA shares uncertainty between cause of death assignments for specific individuals and the distribution of deaths by cause across the population. Using side-by-side comparisons with both observed and simulated data, we demonstrate that InSilicoVA has distinct advantages compared to currently available methods.",

An exploration of Bourdieu's concept of habitus, defined as a system of dispositions, may help medical educators think relationally about the collective trajectory of the group and the individual trajectory of each student. METHODS: We built on our 4\u2011year, longitudinal study which reported how field, capital, and habitus worked together to explain how medical students, as a group, navigated transitions in undergraduate medical education. In this secondary analysis, we reviewed serial collections of narratives about students' peak learning experiences in medical school (19 students, 5 narratives per student), concentrating on first-person representations of self. We then explored the relation between collective and individual trajectories in three illustrative cases. RESULTS: The social space of undergraduate medical education harmonized students' experience and helped explain the collective trajectory, as evidenced by students' consistent reports of taking initiative and staying open-minded. But individuals were not totally harmonized. They had unique dispositions that influenced their ability to access valued resources and shaped their behaviour. For example, Emily consistently spoke of being driven by her own goals; Zach focused on meeting expectations of authorities; Hilary routinely oriented toward abstract medical knowledge. DISCUSSION: Habitus provides a useful conceptual lens for thinking relationally about collective and individual trajectories of medical students. Our work may inform faculty as they seek to situate individualized learning within standardized curricula, and is a step toward researching transitions in medical training from a holistic perspective that includes, but is not limited to, individual trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis is a global threat to which infants are especially vulnerable. Effective vaccines are required to protect infants from this devastating disease. VPM1002, a novel recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine previously shown to be safe and immunogenic in adults, was evaluated for safety in its intended target population, namely, newborn infants in a region with high prevalence of tuberculosis. A total of 48 newborns were vaccinated intradermally with VPM1002 (n = 36) or BCG Danish strain (n = 12) in a phase II open-labeled, randomized trial with a 6-month follow-up period. Clinical and laboratory measures of safety were evaluated during this time. In addition, vaccine-induced immune responses to mycobacteria were analyzed in whole-blood stimulation and proliferation assays. The safety parameters and immunogenicity were comparable in the two groups. Both vaccines induced interleukin-17 (IL-17) responses; however, VPM1002 vaccination led to an increase of CD8(+) IL-17(+) T cells at the week 16 and month 6 time points. The incidence of abscess formation was lower for VPM1002 than for BCG. We conclude that VPM1002 is a safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic vaccine in newborn infants, confirming results from previous trials in adults. These results strongly support further evaluation of the safety and efficacy of this vaccination in larger studies. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT01479972.).",

Measurements were taken within a temperature range of 10 to 55 degrees C. The results were statistically analyzed using mixed-effect and repeated-measure analysis of variance followed by paired multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For all the materials, the E' values decrease with temperature, whereas the tan delta values increase. Irrespective of the temperature, GHF and GRF present E' and E'' values significantly higher than all the other materials and CLI presents values significantly lower than all the other materials. Observation of the values for all the materials reveals a linear progression of the tan delta values with temperature. CONCLUSIONS: A variation in temperature within a physiological range generates modifications in mechanical properties without damaging the material, however. Filler content in volume terms appears to be the crucial parameter in the mechanical behavior of tested materials.

The primary goal of this study is to probe the influence of photosensitizer attachment on the electrocatalytic performance. The position either para or meta to the phosphorus on the phenyl group of the palladium complex was linked via a 2,5-xylyl group to the 3 position of perylene. The electrocatalytic CO(2) reduction activity of the palladium complex is maintained in the meta-linked system, but is lost in the para-linked system, possibly because of unfavorable interactions of the perylene chromophore with the glassy carbon electrode used. Following selective photoexcitation of the perylene, an enhanced perylene excited-state decay rate was observed in the palladium complexes compared to perylene attached to the free ligands. This decrease is accompanied by formation of the perylene cation radical, showing that electron transfer from perylene to the palladium catalyst occurs. Electron transfer and charge recombination were both found to be faster in the para-linked system than in the meta-linked one, which is attributed to stronger electronic coupling in the former. These results illustrate the need to carefully tune the electronic coupling between a photosensitizer chromophore and the catalyst to promote photodriven electron transfer yet inhibit adverse electronic effects of the chromophore on electrocatalysis.",

Multi-omics mechanisms involving genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic variations, not to forget the miRNome, together with environmental contributions, result in an impairment of the immune system in persons with IBD. Such interactions at multiple levels of biology and in concert with the environment constitute the actual engine of this complex disease, demanding a multifactorial and multi-omics perspective to better understand the root causes of IBD. This expert analysis reviews and examines the latest literature and underscores, from the perspective of systems biology, the value of multi-omics technologies as opportunities to unravel the \"IBD integrome.\" We anticipate that multi-omics research will accelerate the new discoveries and insights on IBD in the near future. It shall also pave the way for early diagnosis and help clinicians and families with IBD to forecast and make informed decisions about the prognosis and, possibly, personalized therapeutics in the future.",

        "abstract": "ZPR1 proteins belong to the C4-type of zinc finger coordinators known in animal cells to interact with other proteins and participate in cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, the current knowledge regarding plant ZPR1 proteins is very scarce. Here, we identify a novel potato nuclear factor belonging to this family and named StZPR1. StZPR1 is specifically expressed in photosynthetic organs during the light period, and the ZPR1 protein is located in the nuclear chromatin fraction. From modelling and experimental analyses, we reveal the StZPR1 ability to bind the circadian DNA cis motif 'CAACAGCATC', named CIRC and present in the promoter of the clock-controlled double B-box StBBX24 gene, the expression of which peaks in the middle of the day. We found that transgenic lines silenced for StZPR1 expression still display a 24 h period for the oscillation of StBBX24 expression but delayed by 4 h towards the night. Importantly, other BBX genes exhibit altered circadian regulation in these lines. Our data demonstrate that StZPR1 allows fitting of the StBBX24 circadian rhythm to the light period and provide evidence that ZPR1 is a novel clock-associated protein in plants necessary for the accurate rhythmic expression of specific circadian-regulated genes.",

The incorporation of hard inorganic NMs into the soft organic polymer matrix enhances the physical, chemical, and biological properties of NC hydrogels. Therefore, NC hydrogels are excellent candidates for artificial 3D biomaterials, particularly in tissue engineering applications, where they can mimic the chemical, mechanical, electrical, and biological properties of native tissues. A wide range of functional NMs and synthetic or natural organic polymers have been used to design new NC hydrogels with novel properties and tailored functionalities for biomedical uses. Each of these approaches can improve the development of NC hydrogels and, thus, provide advanced 3D biomaterials for biomedical applications.",

Spatially resolved neutron transmission spectroscopy is an extension of traditional neutron radiography, where multiple images are acquired simultaneously, each corresponding to a narrow range of energy. The analysis of transmission spectra enables studies of bulk microstructures at the spatial resolution comparable to the detector pixel. In this study we demonstrate the possibility of imaging (with ~100 mum resolution) distribution of some microstructure properties, such as residual strain, texture, voids and impurities in Inconel 625 samples manufactured with an additive manufacturing method called direct metal laser melting (DMLM). Although this imaging technique can be implemented only in a few large-scale facilities, it can be a valuable tool for optimization of additive manufacturing techniques and materials and for correlating bulk microstructure properties to manufacturing process parameters. In addition, the experimental strain distribution can help validate finite element models which many industries use to predict the residual stress distributions in additive manufactured components.",

        "abstract": "Noise exposure and the subsequent hearing loss are well documented aspects of military life. Numerous studies have indicated high rates of noise-induced hearing injury (NIHI) in active-duty service men and women, and recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicate a population of veterans with hearing loss that is growing at an increasing rate. In an effort to minimize hearing loss, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) updated its Hearing Conservation Program in 2010, and also has recently revised the DoD Design Criteria Standard Noise Limits (MIL-STD-1474E) which defines allowable noise levels in the design of all military acquisitions including weapons and vehicles. Even with such mandates, it remains a challenge to accurately quantify the noise exposure experienced by a Warfighter over the course of a mission or training exercise, or even in a standard work day. Noise dosimeters are intended for exactly this purpose, but variations in device placement (e.g., free-field, on-body, in/near-ear), hardware (e.g., microphone, analog-to-digital converter), measurement time (e.g., work day, 24-h), and dose metric calculations (e.g., time-weighted energy, peak levels, Auditory Risk Units), as well as noise types (e.g., continuous, intermittent, impulsive) can cause exposure measurements to be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate for a given situation. This paper describes the design of a noise dosimeter capable of acquiring exposure data across tactical environments. Two generations of prototypes have been built at MIT Lincoln Laboratory with funding from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Details related to hardware, signal processing, and testing efforts are provided, along with example tactical military noise data and lessons learned from early fieldings. Finally, we discuss the continued need to prioritize personalized dosimetry in order to improve models that predict or characterize the risk of auditory damage, to integrate dosimeters with hearing-protection devices, and to inform strategies and metrics for reducing NIHI.",

        "abstract": "Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in detecting genetic loci involved in complex traits, few susceptibility genes have been detected for essential hypertension (EH). We aimed to use pooled DNA GWAS approach to identify and validate novel genomic loci underlying EH susceptibility in an Australian case-control population. Blood samples and questionnaires detailing medical history, blood pressure, and prescribed medications were collected for 409 hypertensives and 409 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched normotensive controls. Case and control DNA were pooled in quadruplicate and hybridized to Illumina 1 M-Duo arrays. Allele frequencies agreed with those reported in reference data and known EH association signals were represented in the top-ranked SNPs more frequently than expected by chance. Validation showed that pooled DNA GWAS gave reliable estimates of case and control allele frequencies. Although no markers reached Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance levels (5.0 x 10(-8)), the top marker rs34870220 near ASGR1 approached significance (p = 4.32 x 10(-7)), as did several candidate loci (p < 1 x 10(-6)) on chromosomes 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 17. Four markers (located in or near genes NHSL1, NKFB1, GLI2, and LRRC10) from the top ten ranked SNPs were individually genotyped in pool samples and were tested for association between cases and controls using the chi (2) test. Of these, rs1599961 (NFKB1) and rs12711538 (GLI2) showed significant difference between cases and controls (p < 0.01). Additionally, four top-ranking markers within NFKB1 were found to be in LD, suggesting a single strong association signal for this gene.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A series of 16 consecutive patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) underwent a combined peripheral MRA protocol consisting of FSD-MRA for the calves and large field-of-view CE-MRA. DSA was performed on all patients within 1 week of the MR angiographies. Image quality and degree of stenosis was assessed by two readers with rich experience. Inter-observer agreement was determined using kappa statistics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the diagnostic value of FSD-MRA, CE-MRA, and CE-MRA combined with FSD-MRA (CE+FSD MRA) in predicting vascular stenosis. RESULTS: At the calf station, no significantly difference of subjective image quality scores was found between FSD-MRA and CE-MRA. Inter-reader agreement was excellent for both FSD-MRA and CE-MRA. Both of FSD-MRA and CE-MRA carry a stenosis overestimation risk relative to DSA standard. With DSA as the reference standard, ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve was largest for CE+FSD MRA. The greatest sensitivity and specificity were obtained when a cut-off stenosis score of 2 was used. CONCLUSION: In patients with severe PAD,3 T FSD-MRA provides good-quality diagnostic images without a contrast agent and is a good supplement for CE-MRA. CE+FSD MRA can improve the accuracy of vascular stenosis diagnosis.",

The importance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in placenta invasiveness has been determined in several mammals including species with haemochorial, epitheliochorial and endotheliochorial placentation. Regarding the latter, the expression of MMP enzymes has been studied in the cat and the mature canine placenta. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the early dog placenta. Placentae from 18 to 30 days of pregnancy were collected from four bitches. Two placentae from each bitch were analysed. Placental tissue from one uterine horn was fixed in formaldehyde for immunohistochemistry, while marginal haematoma, labyrinth, non-implantative and implantative endometrium from the contralateral horn were immediately frozen in dry ice for the analysis of MMP expression (Western blot [WB]) and activity (zymography). MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evidenced in the labyrinth, maternal glands and marginal haematoma; this finding was directly correlated with levels of MMP expression by WB, and with the activity of MMP-2, mainly in the haematoma (the area of major remodelling of tissues). Thus, although MMP-9 is well expressed in the early canine placenta, it is not active. Given the important role of MMPs for invasiveness, maternal-foetal angiogenesis and the establishment of a correct foetal nutrition, the results are consistent with the findings in other species in which the MMP-2 activation precedes the MMP-9 one in early placentation.",

        "abstract": "Peatland ecosystem services include drinking water provision, flood mitigation, habitat provision and carbon sequestration. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal is a key treatment process for the supply of potable water downstream from peat-dominated catchments. A transition from peat-forming Sphagnum moss to vascular plants has been observed in peatlands degraded by (a) land management, (b) atmospheric deposition and (c) climate change. Here within we show that the presence of vascular plants with higher annual above-ground biomass production leads to a seasonal addition of labile plant material into the peatland ecosystem as litter recalcitrance is lower. The net effect will be a smaller litter carbon pool due to higher rates of decomposition, and a greater seasonal pattern of DOC flux. Conventional water treatment involving coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation may be impeded by vascular plant-derived DOC. It has been shown that vascular plant-derived DOC is more difficult to remove via these methods than DOC derived from Sphagnum, whilst also being less susceptible to microbial mineralisation before reaching the treatment works. These results provide evidence that practices aimed at re-establishing Sphagnum moss on degraded peatlands could reduce costs and improve efficacy at water treatment works, offering an alternative to 'end-of-pipe' solutions through management of ecosystem service provision.",

Even though some methodologies for intraoperative margin assessment are under clinical and preclinical trials for other solid tumours, a promising modality for oral cancer surgery is not developed. Fluorescent-based optical imaging using Near Infrared (NIR) dyes tagged to tumour specific target will be an optimal tool for this purpose. One such target, Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR) was selected for the study, and its binding peptide, TM1-IR680, was tested for its efficacy for surgical margin prediction in murine orthotopic model of oral cancer, derived from primary samples. Here, for the first time in a preclinical analysis, we show that the size and margin of oral cancer can be predicted, as revealed by 3D-imaging. Interestingly, the peptide was sensitive enough to detect lymph nodes that harboured dispersed tumour cells before colonization, which was impossible to identify by conventional histopathology. We recommend the use of TM1-NIR dyes alone or in combination with other technologies to improve the clinical outcome of oral cancer surgery.",

Compared with controls (no gel), 0.5% RGD-alginate increased: the percentage of EBs with pigmented RPE foci; the percentage EBs with optic vesicles (OVs) and pigmented RPE simultaneously; the area covered by RPE; frequency of RPE cells (CRALBP+); expression of RPE markers (TYR and RPE65) and the retinal ganglion cell marker, MATH5. Furthermore, 0.5% RGD-alginate hydrogel encapsulation did not adversely affect the expression of other neural retina markers (PROX1, CRX, RCVRN, AP2alpha or VSX2) as determined by qRT-PCR, or the percentage of VSX2 positive cells as determined by flow cytometry. 1% RGD-alginate increased the percentage of EBs with OVs and/or RPE, but did not significantly influence any other measures of retinal differentiation. HA-based hydrogels had no significant effect on retinal tissue development. The results indicated that derivation of retinal tissue from hESCs/hiPSCs can be enhanced by culture in 0.5% RGD-alginate hydrogel. This RGD-alginate scaffold may be useful for derivation, transport and transplantation of neural retina and RPE, and may also enhance formation of other pigmented, neural or epithelial tissue. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The burden of retinal disease is ever growing with the increasing age of the world-wide population. Transplantation of retinal tissue derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is considered a promising treatment. However, derivation of retinal tissue from PSCs using defined media is a lengthy process and often variable between different cell lines. This study indicated that alginate hydrogels enhanced retinal tissue development from PSCs, whereas hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels did not. This is the first study to show that 3D culture with a biomaterial scaffold can improve retinal tissue derivation from PSCs. These findings indicate potential for the clinical application of alginate hydrogels for the derivation and subsequent transplantation retinal tissue. This work may also have implications for the derivation of other pigmented, neural or epithelial tissue.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Effective systemic therapeutic options are limited for bladder cancer. In this preclinical study we tested whether bladder cancer gene alterations may be predictive of treatment response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed genomic profiling of two bladder cancer patient derived tumor xenografts (PDX). We optimized the exome sequence analysis method to overcome the mouse genome interference. RESULTS: We identified a number of somatic mutations, mostly shared by the primary tumors and PDX. In particular, BLCAb001, which is less responsive to cisplatin than BLCAb002, carried non-sense mutations in several genes associated with cisplatin resistance, including MLH1, BRCA2, and CASP8. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis revealed the overexpression of cisplatin resistance associated genes such as SLC7A11, TLE4, and IL1A in BLCAb001. Two different PIK3CA mutations, E542K and E545K, were identified in BLCAb001 and BLCAb002, respectively. Thus, we tested whether the genomic profiling was predictive of response to a dual PI3K/mTOR targeting agent, LY3023414. Despite harboring similar PIK3CA mutations, BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 exhibited differential response, both in vitro and in vivo. Sustained target modulation was observed in the sensitive model BLCAb002 but not in BLCAb001, as well as decreased autophagy. Interestingly, computational modelling of mutant structures and affinity binding to PI3K revealed that E542K mutation was associated with weaker drug binding than E545K. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the presence of activating PIK3CA mutations may not necessarily predict in vivo treatment response to PI3K targeted therapies, while specific gene alterations may be predictive for cisplatin response in bladder cancer models and, potentially, in patients as well.",

Based on this theoretical work, we focus on the problem of finding efficient algorithmic solutions for topological interrogation of a 2D digital object of interest D of a presegmented digital image I, using 4-adjacency between pixels of D. In order to maximize the degree of parallelization of the topological processes, we use as many elementary unit processing as pixels the image I has. The mathematical model underlying this framework is an appropriate extension of the classical concept of abstract cell complex: a primal-dual abstract cell complex (pACC for short). This versatile data structure encompasses the notion of Homological Spanning Forest fostered in [14,15]. Starting from a symmetric pACC associated with I, the modus operandi is to construct via combinatorial operations another asymmetric one presenting the maximal number of non-null primal elementary interactions between the cells of D. The fundamental topological tools have been transformed so as to promote an efficient parallel implementation in any parallel-oriented architecture (GPUs, multi-threaded computers, SIMD kernels and so on). A software prototype modeling such a parallel framework is built.",

Data of HR (with subcutaneous electrodes) and [Formula: see text] (by an open-flow methodology) were collected simultaneously on chicken embryos close to end-incubation. Over the last four days of incubation (E16-E20) differences in HR contributed about 30% of the differences in resting [Formula: see text] among embryos. At E20, progressive cooling from 38 to 8 degrees C decreased [Formula: see text] entirely because of the decrease in HR, with minimal compensation of the 'not-HR' component. The same pattern during cooling occurred in younger embryos (age E16), in E20 embryos simultaneously exposed to hypoxia (15% O(2)) and in E20 normoxic embryos which were incubated in hypoxia (15% O(2)). Differently, in E20 embryos in normothermia, progressive hypoxia (15%, 10% or 5% O(2)) lowered [Formula: see text] largely because of the reduction in the 'not-HR' component. We conclude that at end incubation during hypometabolism the changes in HR contribute very differently to the decrease in [Formula: see text] , from about the totality of it during cold to only about 10-20% during hypoxia, depending on its severity. It follows that during cold-hypometabolism, but not during hypoxic hypometabolism, the changes in HR are a good index of the changes in [Formula: see text] .

METHODS: A literature search on SBRT for both renal cancer and pancreatic cancer was performed with focus on prospective trials and technical aspects for clinical implementation. RESULTS: Data on renal and pancreatic SBRT are limited, but show promising rates of local control for both treatment sites. For pancreatic cancer, fractionated SBRT should be preferred to single-dose treatment to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity. Motion-compensation strategies and image guidance are paramount for safe SBRT delivery in both tumor entities. CONCLUSION: SBRT for renal cancer and pancreatic cancer have been successfully evaluated in phase I and phase II trials. Pancreatic SBRT should be practiced carefully and only within prospective protocols due to the risk of severe gastrointestinal toxicity. SBRT for primary renal cell cancer appears a viable option for medically inoperable patients but future research needs to better define patient selection criteria and the detailed practice of SBRT.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Medical management of acute aortic dissections limited to the descending thoracic aorta (AD-desc) is associated with acceptable outcomes. Uncertainty remains about whether acute type B aortic dissections involving the aortic arch (AD-arch) have an increased risk of retrograde extension into the ascending aorta or other dissection-related complications. This study compared outcomes of AD-arch with AD-desc managed medically. METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted from 2005 to 2014 with acute aortic dissections not involving the ascending aorta were retrospectively analyzed. Primary end points included dissection-related death and operative intervention. RESULTS: The study included 99 patients (63% men; mean age, 60 +/- 14 years) with acute aortic dissections. Dissections were limited to the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery (AD-desc) in 79 patients (80%), and 20 (20%) had involvement of the left subclavian (n = 16), left common carotid (n = 1), or innominate (n = 3) arteries (AD-arch). Dissections ended proximal to the celiac artery in 30 patients (30%), between the celiac artery and aortic bifurcation in 36 (36%), and distal to the aortic bifurcation in 33 (33%). During medical management, further proximal extension into the arch occurred in two AD-arch patients and one AD-desc patient (P < .05), but proximal dissection into the ascending aorta occurred in only one AD-arch patient with Marfan disease. Compared with patients with AD-desc, those with AD-arch were younger (53 +/- 12.5 vs 62 +/- 16 years; P < .01) and had more frequent early interventions (40% vs 19%; P = .047), cardiac complications (35% vs 11%; P < .01), and neurologic events (25% vs 6%; P < .01). Seven AD-arch patients (35%) and nine AD-desc patients (11%) died of dissection-related causes (P < .01). Among survivors, late interventions were performed in four of eight AD-arch patients (50%) and in six of 58 AD-desc patients (10%; P = .02). Medical treatment without intervention was successful in four AD-arch patients (20%) and in 52 AD-desc patients (66%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression retained arch involvement as the sole predictor of dissection-related death (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.4) and failure of medical treatment (odds ratio, 7.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-29). The distal extent of dissection had no bearing on outcome. CONCLUSIONS: AD-arch dissections are associated with a higher risk of cardiac and neurologic events, need for early intervention, and dissection-related death than AD-desc dissections. Because further proximal dissections into the ascending aorta were rare in this study, medical management appears to be safe as the initial treatment of AD-arch dissections. However, surgeons should be aware of the increased risk of complications and the potential need for urgent interventions in these patients.",

Reducing DKA admissions in children with T1DM requires a coordinated, comprehensive management plan. We aimed to decrease DKA admissions, 30-day readmissions, and length of stay (LOS) for DKA admissions. METHODS: A multipronged intervention was designed in 2011 to reach all patients: (1) increase insulin pump use and basal-bolus regimen versus sliding scales, (2) transform educational program, (3) increased access to medical providers, and (4) support for patients and families. A before-after study was conducted comparing performance outcomes in years 2007-2010 (preintervention) to 2012-2014 (postintervention) using administrative data and Wilcoxon rank sum and Fischer exact tests. RESULTS: DKA admissions decreased by 44% postintervention (16.7 vs 9.3 per 100 followed patient-years; P = .006), unique patient 30-day readmissions decreased from 20% to 5% postintervention (P = .001), and median LOS significantly decreased postintervention (P < .0001). Although not an original goal of the study, median hemoglobin A1C of a subset of the population transitioned from sliding scale decreased, 10.3% to 8.9% (P < .02). CONCLUSIONS: When clinical and widespread program interventions were used, significant reductions in DKA hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions, and LOS occurred for pediatric T1DM. Continuous performance improvement efforts are needed for improving DKA outcomes.",

However, due to the complex nature of biological samples and their large concentration range, dereplication requires the use of chemometric tools to comprehensively extract information from the acquired data. In this work we developed a reliable GC-MS-based method for the identification of non-targeted plant metabolites by combining the Ratio Analysis of Mass Spectrometry deconvolution tool (RAMSY) with Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System software (AMDIS). Plants species from Solanaceae, Chrysobalanaceae and Euphorbiaceae were selected as model systems due to their molecular diversity, ethnopharmacological potential, and economical value. The samples were analyzed by GC-MS after methoximation and silylation reactions. Dereplication was initiated with the use of a factorial design of experiments to determine the best AMDIS configuration for each sample, considering linear retention indices and mass spectral data. A heuristic factor (CDF, compound detection factor) was developed and applied to the AMDIS results in order to decrease the false-positive rates. Despite the enhancement in deconvolution and peak identification, the empirical AMDIS method was not able to fully deconvolute all GC-peaks, leading to low MF values and/or missing metabolites. RAMSY was applied as a complementary deconvolution method to AMDIS to peaks exhibiting substantial overlap, resulting in recovery of low-intensity co-eluted ions. The results from this combination of optimized AMDIS with RAMSY attested to the ability of this approach as an improved dereplication method for complex biological samples such as plant extracts.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Our study aimed to confirm the correlation between the Cranial Sagittal Vertical Axis (CrSVA) and patient-reported outcomes and to compare clinical correlation between CrSVA and C7 SVA in adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients. METHODS: 108 consecutive ASD patients were evaluated using the EOS((R)) 2D/3D radio-imaging device. A vertical plumb line from the cranial center was utilized to measure the distance to the posterior corner of S1 (CrSVA-S), and to the centers of the hip (CrSVA-H), the knee (CrSVA-K), and ankle (CrSVA-A), as well as measuring the standard C7 SVA. We analyzed the correlation between each CrSVA parameter with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Scoliosis Research Society form (SRS-22r). RESULTS: All 4 CrSVA measures demonstrated strong correlation with the ODI and SRS-22r total score and the pain, self-image, and function subscores. Of note, CrSVA-A (Global SVA) also strongly correlated with the SRS satisfaction subscore. Univariate linear regression showed similar results. The strongest predictor of outcomes was CrSVA, not C7 SVA; (CrSVA-H for ODI, SRS total score, and the pain, self-image, and function subscores; and Global SVA for satisfaction and mental health subscores). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical correlation effect of outcome scores to the CrSVA measures is validated. Global SVA has an especially strong correlation with ODI and all the SRS subscores. Our study confirms that CrSVA is a stronger predictor of preoperative clinical outcomes than the C7 SVA in adult deformity patients.",

We further study the interaction of these two proteins and the possible roles of p75(NTR) and NIX in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)-induced neuronal death. Using the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system, we found that the \"Copper\" domain in p75(NTR) and the TM region in NIX were sufficient for the interaction of these two proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays demonstrated the direct interaction between p75(NTR) and NIX. NIX protein was stabilized by p75(NTR) at post-translational levels. Moreover, p75(NTR) was able to work together with NIX to promote apoptosis and affected the NIX-induced JNK-p53-Bax pathway in neuronal PC12 cells. Previous work has indicated that p75(NTR) and NIX are induced in neurons in human ICH and the rat ICH model, respectively. We confirm that both p75(NTR) and NIX levels were up-regulated in glutamate-treated primary cortical neurons (a cellular in vitro model for ICH) and in the rat ICH model. Glutamate exposure increased the association between p75(NTR) and NIX and elevated the activation of the JNK-p53-Bax pathway and neuronal apoptosis; all of these observations were similar in the rat ICH model. Importantly, p75(NTR) and NIX appeared to be involved in cortical neuronal apoptosis, because knockdown of p75(NTR) or NIX not only inhibited the JNK pathway but also impaired neuronal apoptosis. Thus, p75(NTR) and NIX may play critical roles in ICH-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.",

There is an open theoretical question of the conditions under which linear or nonlinear cue combination is Bayes-optimal. We demonstrate that a neural population decoded by a population vector requires nonlinear cue combination to approximate Bayesian inference. Specifically, if cues are conditionally independent, multiplicative cue combination is optimal for the population vector. The model was tested on neural and behavioral responses in the barn owl's sound localization system where space-specific neurons owe their selectivity to multiplicative tuning to sound localization cues interaural phase (IPD) and level (ILD) differences. We found that IPD and ILD cues are approximately conditionally independent. As a result, the multiplicative combination selectivity to IPD and ILD of midbrain space-specific neurons permits a population vector to perform Bayesian cue combination. We further show that this model describes the owl's localization behavior in azimuth and elevation. This work provides theoretical justification and experimental evidence supporting the optimality of nonlinear cue combination.",

However, the exact role of mobilized HSC/BM-MSC in G-CSF-based therapeutic effects is still unknown. Here, we report that C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) chemotaxis was a key mediator in G-CSF-based therapeutic effects, which was involved in the recruitment of repair-competent cells. Furthermore, we found both mobilized HSCs and BM-MSCs were able to infiltrate into the brain, but only BM-MSCs replenished the neural lineage cells and contributed to neurogenesis in the brains of AD mice. Together, our data show that mobilized BM-MSCs are involved in the replenishment of neural lineages following G-CSF treatment via CXCR4/SDF-1 chemotaxis and further support the potential use of BM-MSCs for further autogenically therapeutic applications.",

METHODS: Gastroduodenal biopsies were taken from 80 patients for histopathology and H. pylori diagnosis. Serum samples were used for evaluation of pepsinogen I (PGI); (PGII); gastrin-17 (G-17). RESULTS: Significant difference (p < 0.001) in lymphocytes & PMNs Fas expression; epithelial & lamina propria Fas localization among H. pylori associated gastric disorders. No correlation between grade of lymphocytes & PMNs Fas expression in gastric epithelia; lamina propria and types of gastric disorder. Significant difference (p < 0.001) in total gastric Fas expression, epithelial Fas; lamina propria and gastric gland Fas expression according to CagA, PGI; PGII; PGI/PGII; Gastrin-17. Total gastric Fas expression has significant correlation with CagA, PGII levels. Gastric epithelial and gastric lamina propria Fas expression have significant correlation with CagA, PGI; PGII levels. Significant difference (p < 0.001) was found in lymphocytes & PMNs Fas expression; epithelial & lamina propria localization of lymphocytes & PMNs Fas expression according to CagA, PGI; PGII; PGI/PGII; Gastrin-17. Lymphocytes Fas expression have correlation with PGI, PGII, PGI/PGII. PMNs Fas expression have correlation with PGI, PGII. CONCLUSION: Fas gene expression and localization on gastric and inflammatory cells affected directly by H. pylori CagA and indirectly by gastric hormones. This contributes to progression of various gastric disorders according to severity of CagA induced gastric pathology and gastric hormones disturbance throughout the course of infection and disease.",

These extracellular cues activate CREB through phosphorylation at Ser133 by various protein serine/threonine kinases. Once phosphorylated, it promotes its association with transcription coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 to activate CREB-dependent gene transcription. Tumor tissues of different origins have been shown to present overexpression and/or overactivation of CREB, indicating CREB as a potential cancer drug target. We previously identified 666-15 as a potent inhibitor of CREB with efficacious anti-cancer activity both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we investigated the specificity of 666-15 and evaluated its potential in vivo toxicity. We found that 666-15 was fairly selective in inhibiting CREB. 666-15 was also found to be readily bioavailable to achieve pharmacologically relevant concentrations for CREB inhibition. Furthermore, the mice treated with 666-15 showed no evidence of changes in body weight, complete blood count, blood chemistry profile, cardiac contractility and tissue histologies from liver, kidney and heart. For the first time, these results demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of CREB is well-tolerated in vivo and indicate that such inhibitors should be promising cancer therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients with poor clinical condition after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH), treatment is often deferred until patients show signs of improvement. Early external ventricular drainage and aneurysm occlusion may improve prognosis also in poor grade patients. The clinical outcome of an expeditious approach was compared with that of a conservative approach. METHODS: In all, 285 consecutive World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade V aSAH patients admitted to three university hospitals between January 2000 and June 2007 were included. Two hospitals followed an expeditious approach, one a more conservative approach. Groups were compared with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics and outcome. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine the associations with good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale scores 4-5), using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Good outcome was seen more often in expeditiously treated patients [22% vs. 11%; odds ratio (OR) 2.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-4.27]. Expeditiously treated patients more often underwent aneurysm occlusion than conservatively treated patients (64% vs. 27%; OR 4.86, 95% CI 2.93-8.05) and placement of an external ventricular catheter (82% vs. 31%; OR 10.05, CI 5.72-10.66). There was no significant difference in rebleeding between patient groups. Occlusion of the aneurysm was the only variable that remained significant in the multivariable model with an OR of 43.73 (95% CI 10.34-184.97). CONCLUSIONS: An expeditious invasive treatment strategy in WFNS grade V aSAH patients can lead to a better outcome. Hesitance in the early stages seems a self-fulfilling prophecy for a poor outcome.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Melanoma skin cancer remains the leading cause of skin cancer-related deaths. Spitz lesions represent a subset of melanocytic skin lesions characterized by epithelioid or spindled melanocytes organized in nests. These lesions occupy a spectrum ranging from benign Spitz and atypical Spitz lesions all the way to malignant Spitz tumors. Appropriate management is reliant on accurate diagnostic classification, yet this effort remains challenging using current light microscopic techniques. The discovery of novel biomarkers such as microRNAs (miR) may ultimately be a useful diagnostic adjunct for the evaluation of Spitz lesions. miR expression profiles have been suggested for non-Spitz melanomas but have yet to be ascribed to Spitz lesions. We hypothesized that distinct miR expression profiles would be associated with different lesions along the Spitz spectrum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNAs extracted from paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues of 11 resected skin lesions including benign nevi (n = 2), benign Spitz lesions (n = 3), atypical Spitz lesions (n = 3), and malignant Spitz tumors (n = 3) were analyzed by the NanoString platform for simultaneous evaluation of over 800 miRs in each patient sample. RESULTS: Benign Spitz lesions had increased expression of miR-21-5p and miR-363-3p compared with those of benign nevi. Malignant Spitz lesions exhibited overexpression of miR-21-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-1283 relative to both benign nevi and benign Spitz tumors. Notably, atypical Spitz tumors had increased expression of miR-451a and decreased expression of miR-155-5p expression relative to malignant Spitz lesions. Conversely, atypical Spitz lesions had increased expression of miR-21-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-451a, miR-1283, and miR-1260a relative to benign Spitz tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, distinct miR profiles are suggested among Spitz lesions of varying malignant potential with some similarities to non-Spitz melanoma tumors. This work demonstrates the feasibility of this analytic method and forms the basis for further validation studies.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Carcinoma in situ of the urinary tract is a high grade form of nonmuscle invasive urothelial cancer. Our understanding of this entity in the upper tract is poor, and case management remains challenging due to knowledge gaps regarding the definition, diagnosis, treatment options and followup of the disease. We reviewed the available literature for similarities and differences between bladder and upper tract carcinoma in situ, and herein summarize the best available data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed PubMed(R) and MEDLINE databases from January 1976 through September 2014. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement was used to screen publications. All authors participated in the development of a consensus definition of disease. RESULTS: A total of 61 publications were found suitable for this review. All studies were retrospective. Compared to bladder carcinoma in situ, upper tract carcinoma in situ appears to have lower progression rates and improved survival. All available studies demonstrate topical therapy to be effective in treating upper tract carcinoma in situ, with decreased recurrence rates compared to bladder carcinoma in situ. Highlighted areas of current knowledge gaps include variable definitions of disease, methods of drug delivery and ideal treatment course. Improving methods for detection may allow easier diagnosis and more effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available data, organ preserving therapy with topical agents is an alternative to radical surgery in select patients with upper tract carcinoma in situ, although this method has not been evaluated in prospective trials. A paradigm shift regarding detection and treatment is needed to improve care and allow better renal preservation. A consensus definition of the disease is offered, and several areas of major knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research are identified.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pregabalin is a gamma aminobutyric acid derivative administered for neuropathic pain. It binds to alpha2delta subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and inhibits calcium inflow of synapses and the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: This study was a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial. Patients were treated with an initial dose of pregabalin at 25 mg; this was then increased up to a maximum of 150 mg depending on the patient during a 12-week study period. Visual Analog Scale, Eight-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-8), and laboratory data were collected at baseline and the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with peripheral neuropathic pain were included, of whom 35 patients were analyzed. The final mean dose of pregabalin was 50.7 mg daily. Mean Visual Analog Scale scores significantly decreased from 52.4 mm at baseline to 34.1 mm at the end of the study (p < 0.0001). Scores for all eight categories of the SF-8 significantly increased compared with baseline (p < 0.05). Both physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-8 also significantly increased (p < 0.05). Ten patients were withdrawn from the study because of drowsiness, dizziness, and invalidity; however, no serious adverse drug reactions were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: If adverse effects are carefully monitored and the administered dosage prudently determined, pregabalin can be an effective treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

        "abstract": "Histones are the fundamental constituents of the eukaryotic chromatin, facilitating the physical organization of DNA in chromosomes and participating in the regulation of its metabolism. The H2A family displays the largest number of variants among core histones, including the renowned H2A.X, macroH2A, H2A.B (Bbd), and H2A.Z. This latter variant is especially interesting because of its regulatory role and its differentiation into 2 functionally divergent variants (H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2), further specializing the structure and function of vertebrate chromatin. In the present work we describe, for the first time, the presence of a second H2A.Z variant (H2A.Z.2) in the genome of a non-vertebrate animal, the mussel Mytilus. The molecular and evolutionary characterization of mussel H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 histones is consistent with their functional specialization, supported on sequence divergence at promoter and coding regions as well as on varying gene expression patterns. More precisely, the expression of H2A.Z.2 transcripts in gonadal tissue and its potential upregulation in response to genotoxic stress might be mirroring the specialization of this variant in DNA repair. Overall, the findings presented in this work complement recent reports describing the widespread presence of other histone variants across eukaryotes, supporting an ancestral origin and conserved role for histone variants in chromatin.",

        "abstract": "Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and its candidacy as a therapeutic target has been evaluated. Gal-3 is widely upregulated in tumors, and its expression is associated with the development and malignancy of PDAC. In the present study, we demonstrate that a polysaccharide, RN1, purified from the flower of Panax notoginseng binds to Gal-3 and suppresses its expression. In addition, RN1 markedly inhibits PDAC cells growth in vitro, in vivo and in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, RN1 binds to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Gal-3, thereby disrupting the interaction between Gal-3 and EGFR and downregulating extracellular-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and the transcription factor of Gal-3, Runx1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of Runx1 by RN1, suppresses Gal-3 expression and inactivates Gal-3-associated signaling pathways, including the EGFR/ERK/Runx1, BMP/smad/Id-3 and integrin/FAK/JNK signaling pathways. In addition, RN1 can also bind to bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2) and block the interaction between Gal-3 and the BMPRs. Thus, our results suggest that a novel Gal-3 inhibitor RN1 may be a potential candidate for human PDAC treatment via multiple targets and multiple signaling pathways.",

Patients with resistant hypertension have been shown to be at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events, hence the need for greater efforts in improving the treatment of hypertension. The renal sympathetic nerves play an important role in the development of hypertension, mediated via sodium and water retention, increased renin release and alterations in renal blood flow. The proximity of the afferent and efferent renal sympathetic nerves to the adventitia of the renal arteries suggested the feasibility of an endovascular, selective, minimally invasive approach to renal denervation; a potential treatment option for resistant hypertension. While the RAPID, Reduce-HTN, EnligHTN, DENERHTN and Symplicity HTN-1 and -2 studies showed significant benefit of renal denervation in the treatment of resistant hypertension, the results of Oslo RDN, Prague-15 and Symplicity HTN-3 were not so favorable. Future well-designed clinical trials are needed to ascertain the benefits or otherwise of renal denervation in treatment-resistant hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide-1,1-dioxide) belongs to the class of diuretic agents that represent one of today's cornerstones of the treatment of hypertensive patients. In addition to its clinical relevance, HCTZ is prohibited in sports according to the regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) at all times and has frequently been detected in sports drug testing urine samples worldwide since its ban was introduced in 1988. Despite these facts, the adverse analytical finding concerning HCTZ in an in-competition routine doping control sample collected in December 2014 was further investigated, particularly motivated by the comparably low urinary concentration of the drug accounting for approximately 5ng/mL. The athlete in question did not declare the use of any nutritional supplement or medication other than the ingestion of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prior to competition. Hence, the drug (formulated as coated tablet) provided by the athlete as well as the corresponding retention sample of the manufacturer were analyzed. Noteworthy, both samples confirmed the presence of about 2mug of HCTZ per tablet. In order to further probe for the plausibility of the observed urinary HCTZ concentrations with the scenario of drug ingestion and subsequent doping control sample collection, administration studies with produced HCTZ-spiked placebo-tablets (2.5mug of HCTZ/tablet) were conducted. Urine specimens were collected prior to and after ingestion of the drug and subjected to routine doping control analytical procedures employing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. While blank urine samples returned negative test results, post-administration specimens were found to contain HCTZ at concentrations of approximately 1-16ng/mL, which supported the athlete's inadvertent intake of HCTZ via contaminated NSAID tablets. Due to the substantial sensitivity of test methods employed today by doping control laboratories, even drug contaminations ranging within the good manufacturing practice (GMP) limit of 10ppm overall carry-over can evidently lead to adverse analytical findings. This calls into question whether selected (classes of) substances such as diuretics should be reported only when exceeding a defined reporting level and/or whether adverse analytical findings of non-threshold substances should be reported with an estimated semi-quantitative concentration of the identified substance to facilitate the result management by anti-doping organizations.",

Numerous unsuccessful attempts at culturing H. meleagridis axenically have reinforced the assumption that the protozoa had an obligate relationship with certain bacteria originating from the host ceca. Within these perspectives, we enriched H. meleagridis cells from a mono-eukaryotic culture copropagated with host cecal bacteria by flow cytometry. The enrichment of histomonads was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. For the first time several protein spots were successfully identified. The majority of spots were annotated as cytoskeletal proteins. Actin microfilaments are known to be a key player in cell spreading, cell adhesion, phagocytosis, signal transduction, and several other processes. Together with the identification of superoxide dismutase, the information generated from protein analysis of H. meleagridis may serve as a very first step toward understanding its pathogenesis and virulence.",

The impact of the disease is not limited to the affected CLH, but also affects their caregivers and family members. We qualitatively explored the experiences, knowledge, concerns, and perceptions of primary caregivers and triangulated those aspects with those expressed by their CLH. We conducted 34 in-depth interviews (IDI) with primary caregivers of 8- to 15-year-old CLH residing in West Bengal, India. Four focus group discussions (FGD) with CLH were held, two each with children aged 8-12 and 13-15 years. Participants were recruited with the help of a community-based organization providing need-based services to adults and CLH. Five major themes shared by caregivers and children were identified, including concerns about HIV, medications, discriminatory behaviors, having a \"healthy mind\", and the advantages and limitations of available HIV-related health services. Two primary themes exclusively from IDI with caregivers were caregiving challenges and concerns about the future of their CLH. Indian CLH and their caregivers face many daily challenges, and there are many unmet but relevant expectations. Caregiving goes beyond the child-caregiver dynamic, and is intertwined with the local community and the healthcare and support system structures. The current study underscores the need for comprehensive care programs focusing on improving support to both CLH and caregivers.",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants included women with (n = 50) and without (n = 316) preeclampsia (PE) at delivery, recruited in the REPROgrammed fetal and/or maternal METAbolism (REPROMETA) study (2006-2011, Estonia). Genetic association analysis combined PE cases (n = 597) and controls (n = 623) from the REPROMETA and Finnish Genetics of Preeclampsia Consortium (2008-2011) studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Maternal postpartum plasma STC1 was measured by ELISA (n = 366) and placental STC1 gene expression by TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR (n = 120). Genotyping was performed using Sequenom MassArray. RESULTS: Significantly higher STC1 plasma level was measured for the PE (median, 1952 pg/mL; 1030-4284 pg/mL) compared with non-PE group (median, 1562 pg/mL; 423-3781 pg/mL; P = 3.7 x 10(-4), Mann-Whitney U test). Statistical significance was enhanced after adjustment for cofactors (linear regression, P = 1.8 x 10(-6)). STC1 measurements were negatively correlated with maternal smoking. Prepregnancy body mass index had a positive correlation with STC1 only among PE patients (r = 0.45; P = .001). The strongest genetic association with hormone concentrations was detected for STC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3758089 (C allele: minor allele frequency, 5%; linear regression: beta = 249.2 pg/mL; P = .014) and rs12678447 (G allele: minor allele frequency, 7%; beta = 147.0 pg/mL; P = .082). rs12678447 placental genotypes were significantly associated with STC1 gene expression (P = .014). The REPROMETA/Finnish Genetics of Preeclampsia Consortium meta-analysis suggested an increased risk to develop late-onset PE for the rs12678447 G allele carriers (P = .05; odds ratio = 1.38 [0.98-1.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Increased STC1 hormone represents a hallmark of late-onset PE. STC1 gene variants modulate placental gene expression and maternal hormone levels.",

There was near-complete resolution of the bladder diverticulum following endoscopic management, obviating the need for bladder diverticulectomy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Percutaneous scaphoid screw fixation is a popular treatment for acute scaphoid fractures with no or minimal displacement. For treating scaphoid nonunions, however, open reduction and internal fixation with bone grafting is still the most popular treatment. Percutaneous fixation with bone grafting through the screw insertion hole has received little attention, although it minimizes damage to the surrounding tissues. We report excellent results of six scaphoid nonunions treated by retrograde percutaneous fixation with curettage and bone grafting through the distal insertion hole of a fully threaded headless screw. METHODS: Six scaphoid nonunions with substantial bone loss were treated, including one revision case. All nonunions were located at the middle third of the scaphoid. The mean patient age at operation was 26 years, and the mean interval between fracture and surgery was 7 months. In the revision case, the interval between the primary and revision surgery was 6 months. In one case, curettage alone was performed before retrograde insertion of the headless screw. In the other cases including the revision, curettage and bone grafting with a bone biopsy needle was required through a distal insertion hole. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 11.3 months. Radiologically, union was achieved at averaged 12 weeks postoperatively. At the final follow-up, there was significant improvement in the wrist extension range of movement (from 65.8 degrees  to 80.8 degrees ) and grip strength (from 69.5% to 93.0% of the unaffected side). Five patients were free of pain, and one experienced mild pain only during heavy manual labor. The mean VAS, DASH, and Cooney wrist scores were 0.3, 1 and 99, respectively. All patients returned to their work or athletic activities. CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde percutaneous fixation with bone grafting through the distal insertion hole of a fully threaded headless screw is a promising option for surgical treatment of scaphoid nonunions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Burns are one of the most severe traumas that an individual can suffer. The World Health Organization (WHO) affirms that injuries related to burns are a global public health problem mainly in low- and middle-income countries. The first step towards reducing any preventable injury is based on accurate information. In Colombia, the basic epidemiological characteristics of burn injuries are unknown. The objectives were establishing the causes, high-risk populations, mortality rate, and tendencies of burn deaths. METHODS: Observational, analytical, population-based study based on official death certificate occurred between 2000 and 2009. All codes of the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) related to burns were included. The mortality rates were standardized using the WHO world average age weights 2000-2025. To determine the tendency, an average annual percent change (AACP) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 5448 deaths due to burns were identified; 78.4 % were men. The crude and adjusted burn mortality rate was 1.270 and 1.302 per 100,000, respectively. The AACP was -5.25 %. Electrical injury caused the greatest number of deaths (49.5 %), followed by fire and lightning injuries. A total of 1197 (22.1 %) children were under 15 years old. The causes of deaths were different among age groups. 59.4 % deaths occurred outside health institutions. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first step in identifying the main causes of death and groups with higher mortality rates. Electricity is the main cause of deaths due to burn injury. Further research is required in order to generate awareness among government and community for reducing the number of injuries and burn deaths in our country.",

However, only two such RCTs investigated a follow-up period of more than 1 year, both applying focused ESWT. Corresponding data for radial ESWT (rESWT) have not yet been reported. We therefore tested the hypothesis that rESWT is effective and safe for the management of cPF with long-term follow-up of 2 years. To this end n = 50 patients with cPF were randomly allocated to either two sessions of rESWT (one session per week; 2,000 shock waves with energy flux density of 0.16 mJ/mm(2) per session) (n = 25) or to placebo treatment (n = 25). Evaluation was by change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score and Roles and Maudsley (RM) score. Mean pretreatment VAS scores for the rESWT and placebo groups were 8.5 and 8.9, respectively. 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment, the mean VAS scores for the rESWT and placebo groups were 0.6, 1.1, 0.5, 2.3, and 1.4 and 7.6, 7.7, 7.4, 6.9, and 5.6 (p < 0.001), respectively. Differences in mean RM scores were statistically significant between groups at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post treatment, but not at baseline. There were no significant complications.

Resveratrol, a polyphenol found mainly in grapes and red wine, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. Studies demonstrated that resveratrol could prevent memory deficits and the increase in acetylcholinesterase activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. However, whether administration of resveratrol could modulate the structural synaptic plasticity in diabetic rats remains unknown. Therefore, we tested its influence against cognitive dysfunction as well as on hippocampal structural synaptic plasticity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Our results showed that the cognitive performances in diabetic group were markedly deteriorated, accompanied by noticeable alterations in oxidative as well as inflammation parameters, SYN and GAP-43 expression were reduced in the hippocampus. In contrast, chronic treatment with resveratrol (10, 20mg/kg) improved neuronal injury and cognitive performance by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation as well as inhibiting synapse loss in diabetic rats. In conclusion, the present study suggested that oral supplementation of resveratrol might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and/or prevention of diabetic encephalopathy.",

However, a lack of widely-applicable analytical tools has restricted the study of this process, particularly in bacteria. In E. coli, only four O-linked glycoproteins have previously been characterized. Here we present a glycoproteomics technique, termed BEMAP, which is based on the beta-elimination of O-linked glycans followed by Michael-addition of a phosphonic acid derivative, and subsequent titanium dioxide enrichment. This strategy allows site-specific mass-spectrometric identification of proteins with O-linked glycan modifications in a complex biological sample. Using BEMAP we identified cell surface-associated and membrane vesicle glycoproteins from Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and non-pathogenic E. coli K-12. We identified 618 glycosylated Serine and Threonine residues mapping to 140 proteins in ETEC, including several known virulence factors, and 34 in E. coli K-12. The two strains had 32 glycoproteins in common. Remarkably, the majority of the ETEC glycoproteins were conserved in both strains but nevertheless were only glycosylated in the pathogen. Therefore, bacterial O-linked glycosylation is much more extensive than previously thought, and is especially important to the pathogen.",

OBJECTIVES: To describe a novel group of contact allergens: N-(2-phenylethyl) derivatives of the reactive amine 1,3-benzenedimethanamine (1,3-BDMA). METHODS: We describe the clinical examinations and exposure of 6 patients with occupational contact allergy to derivatives of 1,3-BDMA. RESULTS: Of the 6 patients, 4 were spray painters who used epoxy paints, 1 was a floor layer who handled a variety of epoxy coatings, and 1 was a worker in epoxy hardener manufacture. We were able to confirm exposure to epoxy hardeners that contained derivatives of 1,3-BDMA in 5 of the 6 sensitized patients. Despite the close structural resemblance between derivatives of 1,3-BDMA and m-xylylenediamine (MXDA), only 3 patients reacted positively to MXDA. Concomitant contact allergy to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A resin was seen in 2 of the 6 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the lack of a commercially available patch test substance, the diagnosis of contact allergy to derivatives of 1,3-BDMA requires patch testing with either the epoxy hardener product or a hardener ingredient that contains the derivatives of 1,3-BDMA.",

We transplanted mouse neural stem cells into zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages and found that they mainly formed neural tissues while occasionally trans-differentiated into mesoderm- and endoderm-derived tissues. Because zebrafish embryo is transparent, the behaviors of transplanted mouse stem cells can be easily tracked in a real-time manner and at single-cell resolution. We expect that this assay may be widely applied to explore the in vivo behaviors of any stem cells available.",

Understanding the relationships among these two species groups and how they are affected by environmental conditions is a major challenge for ecologists, especially considering the distinction between local environmental factors and regional factors and variations in abundance over the course of the year. In this study, we focused on the long-term relationship between the abundance of rare and common ephemeropterans and abiotic factors on local and regional scales. Our hypotheses are that common species will be affected primarily by regional environmental variables (i), whereas rare species will be influenced more by temporal variation (ii). Together, both local and regional abiotic variables, plus temporal variation, best explained the abundance of the common species, whereas temporal variation was the best predictor of rare species. Considering the theoretical aspects and the empirical evidence, we discuss the results based on the plasticity of the common species and the life cycle of the rare ones. We believe that our findings reinforce the need for the deconstruction of communities for a deeper understanding of their relationships with abiotic variables and, in particular, the specific aspects of these relationships in the context of the different guilds of the community.",

Results of Fourier-transform infrared characterization and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry qualitative analysis showed that the crude sugarcane wax consisted of fatty fractions (fatty acids, fatty aldehydes, hydrocarbons, and esters) and small amount of lignin derivatives. In addition, the effect of dewaxing pretreatment on the enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse was also investigated. The digestibilities of cellulose and xylan in dewaxed sugarcane bagasse were 18.7 and 10.3%, respectively, compared with those of 13.1 and 8.9% obtained from native sugarcane bagasse. The dewaxed sugarcane bagasse became more accessible to enzyme due to the disruption of the outermost layer of the waxy materials.",

However, in some cases, especially for transosseous branches from extracranial arteries like the occipital artery (OcA) or the superficial temporal artery (STA), such penetration is usually poor, leading to major proximal reflux and incomplete fistula obliteration. We present three cases of embolization in two patients with TS DAVF through the OcA and/or the STA with Onyx(R) using a double-lumen balloon (Microvention, Tustin, CA, USA). This technique allows the penetration of the embolic agent in the transosseous branches by forming a counter-pressure with the inflated balloon. This technique may be useful to achieve complete occlusion of TS DAVFs by endovascular means."

        "abstract": "Recurrence of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas after surgery and chemotherapy may be attributed, in part, to the presence of a small population of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSC). The expression of galectin-3 (Gal3), a multifunctional oncolectin, has been associated with biological behaviors associated with CSC. We examined the ability of Gal3 to characterize the CSC phenotype, and to identify a clinically important gastrointestinal cancer CSC population. Human colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines were sorted to identify subpopulations expressing commonly used CSC markers, and Gal3-positive CSC subpopulations. The association of Gal3 with the stem cell properties and alterations of these phenotypes by manipulation of Gal3 expression was examined. Gastrointestinal cancer cell lines contain both Gal3-positive and Gal3-negative subpopulations. Gal3-positive CSCs are characterized by high ALDH activity, enhanced self-renewal ability in vitro (sphere formation) and tumor forming ability in vivo, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and death-receptor-mediated apoptosis compared to Gal3-negative CSCs. Silencing Gal3 modifies this behavior. Cell surface Gal3 expression identifies a subset of CSCs in gastrointestinal cancers with high levels of stem cell characteristics, including chemoresistance. This may provide a platform for developing treatment strategies that target CSC.",

The first signal, which occurred due to rebound and surface uplift in the Alps, was a regional and simultaneous switch from basin underfill to overfill at 30 Ma paired with shifts to coarse-grained depositional environments in the foreland basin. The second signal, however, arrived several million years after slab breakoff and was marked by larger contributions of crystalline clasts in the conglomerates, larger clast sizes, larger sediment fluxes and shifts to more proximal facies. We propose that this secondary pulse reflects a delayed whiplash-type erosional response to surface uplift, where erosion and sediment flux became amplified through positive feedbacks once larger erosional thresholds of crystalline bedrock were exceeded.",

Key components of a new Act would ideally include plans and targets with teeth, a focus on the industry, a focus on the product, reduction of supply, and a whole-of-society approach to promote consistency in policy implementation through: i) a public duty on government agencies to act consistently with smokefree law; ii) a general duty on those associated with the tobacco/nicotine industry in relation to tobacco control objectives; and iii) a principle requiring international treaties to be interpreted consistently with tobacco control objectives. CONCLUSION: Strategies such as those identified in this Viewpoint should be explored further as part of urgently needed planning to achieve the New Zealand Government's goal for Smokefree Aotearoa by 2025.",

        "abstract": "The study investigates how agreement between leaders' and their team's perceptions influence intervention outcomes in a leadership-training intervention aimed at improving organizational learning. Agreement, i.e. perceptual distance was calculated for the organizational learning dimensions at baseline. Changes in the dimensions from pre-intervention to post-intervention were evaluated using polynomial regression analysis with response surface analysis. The general pattern of the results indicated that the organizational learning improved when leaders and their teams agreed on the level of organizational learning prior to the intervention. The improvement was greatest when the leader's and the team's perceptions at baseline were aligned and high rather than aligned and low. The least beneficial scenario was when the leader's perceptions were higher than the team's perceptions. These results give insights into the importance of comparing leaders' and their team's perceptions in intervention research. Polynomial regression analyses with response surface methodology allow three-dimensional examination of relationship between two predictor variables and an outcome. This contributes with knowledge on how combination of predictor variables may affect outcome and allows studies of potential non-linearity relating to the outcome. Future studies could use these methods in process evaluation of interventions. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

In results, apelin-13 caused significant decreases in serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels (p < 0.05). Administration of apelin-13 significantly increased body weights, food intake, serum low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels (p < 0.05), but caused significant decreases in high-density lipoprotein levels (p < 0.05). Serum glucose and triglyceride levels were not significantly altered by apelin-13 administration. Significant decreases in both uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 levels in the white and brown adipose tissues and UCP-3 levels in the biceps muscle (p < 0.05) were noted. The findings of the study suggest that apelin-13 may not only lead to obesity by increasing body weight but also cause infertility by suppressing reproductive hormones.",

Methodologies that illustrate the complexity of patients' group experiences might aid in choosing group style, or testing therapeutic mechanisms. We used this naturalistic study as a beginning step to explore methods for comparing cancer group contexts by first modifying a group-experience survey to be cancer-specific (Group Experience Questionnaire (GEQ)). Hypothesizing that therapist-led (TL) would differ from non-therapist-led (NTL), we explored the GEQ's multiple dimensions. A total of 292 patients attending three types of groups completed it: 2 TL groups differing in therapy style ((1) Supportive-Expressive (SET); (2) The Wellness Community (TWC/CSC)); (3) a NTL group. Participants rated the importance of \"Expressing True Feelings\" and \"Discussing Sexual Concerns\" higher in TL than NTL groups and \"Discussing Sexual Concerns\" higher in SET than other groups. They rated \"Developing a New Attitude\" higher in TWC/CSC compared to NTL. In addition, we depict the constellation of group qualities using radar-charts to assist visualization. These charts facilitate a quick look at a therapy model's strengths and weaknesses. Using a measure like the GEQ and this visualization technique could enable health-service decision making about choice of therapy model to offer.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study are to analyse adherence to antidepressant treatment over 2 years in Sweden among women and men who initiated treatment with citalopram and to identify groups at risk of non-adherence using trajectory models. METHODS: The study population, including individuals 18-85 years who initiated citalopram use between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007, was identified in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and followed for 2 years. Adherence was estimated with continuous measure of medication acquisition (CMA) and group-based trajectory modelling, a method which describes adherence patterns over time by estimating trajectories of adherence and the individual's probability of belonging to a specific trajectory. RESULTS: The study population included 54,248 individuals, 64 % women. Mean CMA was 52 % among women and 50 % among men (p < 0.001). Five different adherence patterns (Trajectories) were identified. Similar proportion of women and men belonged to each Trajectory. Around 29 % of the women and 27 % of the men belonged to the Trajectory which showed full adherence throughout the 2-year study period. The other four Trajectories showed adherence that declined to different degrees and at different stages in time. Having low socioeconomic status was more common among individuals in Trajectories showing declining adherence than in the adherent Trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: Using trajectory modelling, five Trajectories describing different patterns of adherence to citalopram treatment over time were identified. A large proportion discontinued treatment early and having low socioeconomic status increased the risk of being non-adherent.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several reports have indicated that left ventricular (LV) lead placement at an optimal pacing site is an important determinant of short- and long-term outcome. This study investigated the effect of pacing mode (atrioventricular [AV] or ventricular) and site (LV apical or lateral) outside the ischemic region on the LV hemodynamic, torsional and strain indices in the ischemic myocardium. METHODS: Experiments were conducted in anesthetized open-chest pigs (n = 15) 30 min after LAD ligation to investigate the hemodynamic effects of temporary epicardial AV and ventricular LV pacing at the LV apical (outside the ischemic region) or lateral wall. LV hemodynamic data were recorded (ejection fraction, stroke volume, dP/dt(max), systolic pressure, cardiac output and e/e\u0384 ratio) and torsional (twist, rotation), as well as deformation (radial and circumferential strain), indices of LV function were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging. RESULTS: The LV function was highly dependent on the pacing mode and site. LV dP/dt(max), systolic pressure and twist decreased significantly during LV pacing in comparison to sinus rhythm (p = 0.004, p<0.001, p = 0.002, respectively). Torsion in sinus rhythm decreased significantly during AV-pacing at the lateral wall (0.11+/-0.04 degrees /mm vs. 0.06+/-0.02 degrees /mm, p = 0.005) but did not change significantly during AV-pacing at the apex (0.07+/-0.05 degrees /mm). CONCLUSIONS: LV pacing at the apical or lateral wall, in the ischemic myocardium, leads to a suboptimal response in comparison to sinus rhythm. LV pacing at the apex outside the ischemic area exhibits a better response than pacing at the lateral wall, possibly because pacing from this site leads to a more physiological propagation of electrical conduction.",

        "abstract": "The advent of functional contrast agents and nanoparticle drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) is opening new pathways to understanding pathophysiology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nitroxyl radical compounds are promising functional contrast agents for redox evaluation. We have developed a novel nitroxyl radical theranostic compound for noninvasive real-time imaging of blood-brain barrier-permeable antitumor drugs. Divalent manganese ions (Mn(2+)) can also be used as an intracellular functional MRI contrast agent. Manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) provides a unique opportunity to study neuronal activation and architecture. Extracellular Mn(2+) can enter cells through NMDA receptors for glutamate and/or voltage-gated calcium channels. Thus, Mn(2+) can behave as a functional contrast agent depending on the cellular activity/viability. This paper summarizes the recent progress in MEMRI for neuroimaging and cancer research. Nanocarriers for DDS can contain multiple functional elements, such as therapeutic drugs, MRI contrast agents, fluorescent dyes, and radioisotopes, without significant changes in the particle kinetics/dynamics. Various materials have also been reported as nano-DDS carriers, including micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, quantum dots, and carbon materials such as fullerenes, with each material providing a different set of characteristics as a nano-DDS carrier. Our recent research into nano-DDS-based contrast agents and the theranostic applications is also outlined.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the distribution of a booklet providing information to fathers during their partners' pregnancies on fathers' and mothers' postpartum mental health and quality of life (QOL), as well as on fathers' childcare participation and living situations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomised controlled trial will comprise 554 couples consisting of pregnant women due to give birth at an obstetric institution in Aichi Prefecture, Japan and their partners. Participants will be recruited during prenatal check-ups in the third trimester, and those who provide written consent will be allocated randomly to an intervention and a control group. The pregnant women's partners allocated to the intervention group will be given a booklet written for men containing information on childbirth and postnatal period. Its content will include matters such as what preparations the partner should make before birth and tips for housework and childcare as well as how to prevent unintentional injury to the baby. The control group will not receive any intervention. A baseline survey in the third trimester and follow-up surveys at 1 and 3 months post partum will be carried out using self-administered questionnaires. The primary outcome is the proportion of new mothers' partners at risk for paternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score >/=8). Secondary outcomes include the risk of postnatal depression in new mothers, QOL of new mothers and their partners, partners' knowledge of and engagement in housework and childcare, marital relations and parenting stress on the part of new mothers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethical Committee at the National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan. The results of the study will be widely disseminated as peer-reviewed papers and at international conferences, with the aim of improving public health services in Japan.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Repellents such as coils, vaporizers, mats and creams can be used to reduce the risk of malaria and other infectious diseases. Although evidence for their effectiveness is limited, they are advertised as providing an additional approach to mosquito control in combination with other strategies, e.g. insecticide-treated nets. We examined the use of repellents in India in an urban setting in Chennai (mainly Plasmodium vivax malaria), a peri-urban setting in Nadiad (both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria), and a more rural setting in Raurkela (mainly P. falciparum malaria). METHODS: The use of repellents was examined at the household level during a census, and at the individual level in cross-sectional surveys and among patients visiting a clinic with fever or other symptoms. Factors associated with their use were examined in a multivariate analysis, and the association between malaria and the use of repellents was assessed among survey- and clinic participants. RESULTS: Characteristics of participants differed by region, with more people of higher education present in Chennai. Use of repellents varied between 56-77 % at the household level and between 32-78 % at the individual level. Vaporizers were the main repellents used in Chennai, whereas coils were more common in Nadiad and Raurkela. In Chennai and Nadiad, vaporizers were more likely to be used in households with young male children. Vaporizer use was associated with higher socio-economic status (SES) in households in Chennai and Nadiad, whereas use of coils was greater in the lower SES strata. In Raurkela, there was a higher use of coils among the higher SES strata. Education was associated with the use of a repellent among survey participants in Chennai and clinic study participants in Chennai and Nadiad. Repellent use was associated with less malaria in the clinic study in Chennai and Raurkela, but not in the surveys, with the exception of the use of coils in Nadiad. CONCLUSIONS: Repellents are widely used in India. Their use is influenced by the level of education and SES. Information on effectiveness and guidance on choices may improve rational use.",

After adding platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) into the liquid crystal mixtures, the emission spectra of DDPDLCs revealed a lower lasing threshold in comparison with those of DDPDLCs without Pt NPs due to light scattering of liquid crystal droplets and the local field enhancement around Pt NPs. Furthermore, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the lasing threshold were determined by the doping density of the Pt NPs. The threshold was decreased by about half from 17.5  muJ/pulse to 8.7  muJ/pulse on the condition that around 1.0 wt. % was the optimum concentration of Pt NPs doped into the DDPDLCs. The FWHM of the peaks sharply decreased to 0.1 nm. Our work provides an extremely simple method to enhance random lasers from DDPDLCs doped with Pt NPs, and it has potential applications in random fiber lasers or laser displays.",

        "abstract": "Post-translational protein modifications such as citrullination have been linked to the breach of immune tolerance and clinical autoimmunity. Previous studies from our laboratory support this concept, demonstrating that autoantibodies targeting citrullinated isoforms of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) are associated with rheumatoid arthritis complicated by interstitial lung disease. To further explore the relationship between citrullination and structural determinants of HSP90 immunogenicity, we employed a combination of ELISA-based epitope profiling, computational modeling, and mass-spectrometric sequencing of peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD)-modified protein. Remarkably, ELISAs involving selected citrullinated HSP90beta/alpha peptides identified a key epitope corresponding to an internal Arg residue (R502 [HSP90beta]/R510 [HSP90alpha]) that is normally buried within the crystal structure of native/unmodified HSP90. In vitro time/dose-response experiments reveal an ordered pattern of PAD-mediated deimination events culminating in citrullination of R502/R510. Conventional as well as scaled molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that citrullination of selected Arg residues leads to progressive disruption of HSP90 tertiary structure, promoting exposure of R502/R510 to PAD modification and subsequent autoantibody binding. Consistent with this process, ELISAs incorporating variably deiminated HSP90 as substrate Ag indicate a direct relationship between the degree of citrullination and the level of ex vivo Ab recognition. Overall, these data support a novel structural paradigm whereby citrullination-induced shifts in protein structure generate cryptic epitopes capable of bypassing B cell tolerance in the appropriate genetic context.",

        "abstract": "Many computer vision problems can be posed as learning a low-dimensional subspace from high-dimensional data. The low rank matrix factorization (LRMF) represents a commonly utilized subspace learning strategy. Most of the current LRMF techniques are constructed on the optimization problems using L(1)-norm and L(2)-norm losses, which mainly deal with the Laplace and Gaussian noises, respectively. To make LRMF capable of adapting more complex noise, this paper proposes a new LRMF model by assuming noise as mixture of exponential power (MoEP) distributions and then proposes a penalized MoEP (PMoEP) model by combining the penalized likelihood method with MoEP distributions. Such setting facilitates the learned LRMF model capable of automatically fitting the real noise through MoEP distributions. Each component in this mixture distribution is adapted from a series of preliminary superor sub-Gaussian candidates. Moreover, by facilitating the local continuity of noise components, we embed Markov random field into the PMoEP model and then propose the PMoEP-MRF model. A generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm and a variational GEM algorithm are designed to infer all parameters involved in the proposed PMoEP and the PMoEPMRF model, respectively. The superiority of our methods is demonstrated by extensive experiments on synthetic data, face modeling, hyperspectral image denoising, and background subtraction.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes, an unresolved metabolic disorder, and lead contamination are prevalent problems in contemporary society. Previously, we have reported that either diabetes or lead exposure resulted in reproductive toxicity in male Wistar rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether diabetic rats exposed to lead demonstrate a higher degree of reproductive toxicity when compared with lead-exposed control rats. Diabetes was induced by injecting a single dose of streptozotocin (50 mg per kg body weight). Control and diabetic rats were exposed to lead at a concentration of 819 mg L(-1) (0.15% lead acetate) through drinking water for a period of 30 days and assessed for reproductive and oxidative end points. The relative weights of the testes, epididymis, seminal vesicles, and the prostate gland were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Daily sperm production, epididymal sperm count, motile, viable and HOS-tail swelled sperms, serum testosterone levels and testicular 3beta- and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity levels were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Significant reductions in testicular and epididymal antioxidant enzyme activity levels and glutathione levels were observed in diabetic rats with an elevation in the levels of superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxides, and lipid peroxidation. A significant reduction in the number of implantations associated with elevated pre- and post-implantation losses was observed in females mated with diabetic males. Mild histopathological malformations were observed in the testis of the diabetic rats. Similar reproductive and oxidative toxicities were observed in lead-exposed control rats. Furthermore, lead exposed diabetic rats showed additional deterioration in reproductive end points and a noteworthy elevation in oxidative toxicity, suggesting that treatment with lead exacerbates reproductive toxicity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: rVIII-SingleChain, a novel recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII), has been designed as a B-domain truncated construct with covalently bonded heavy and light chains, aiming to increase binding affinity to von Willebrand factor (VWF). Preclinical studies confirmed greater affinity for VWF, giving improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared with full-length rFVIII. AIM: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of rVIII-SingleChain and compare them against those of full-length rFVIII. METHODS: This study enrolled 27 patients with severe haemophilia A in the AFFINITY clinical trial programme. After a 4-day washout period, all patients received a single infusion of 50 IU kg(-1) octocog alfa (Advate((R)) ); after a >/=4-day postinfusion washout period, they received a single infusion of 50 IU kg(-1) rVIII-SingleChain. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments of each product were collected before infusion (predose) and at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 10, 24, 32, 48 and 72 h postinfusion for both products. RESULTS: rVIII-SingleChain had a longer mean half-life (t1/2 ) (14.5 vs. 13.3 h), lower mean clearance (CL) (2.64 vs. 3.68 mL h(-1) kg(-1) ), higher mean residence time (20.4 vs. 17.1 h) and larger mean AUCinf (2090 vs. 1550 IU?h dL(-1) ) than octocog alfa, respectively. The mean AUCinf after rVIII-SingleChain infusion was ~35% larger than after octocog alfa. A similar pattern was observed for AUC0-last . No serious adverse events or inhibitors were reported. CONCLUSIONS: rVIII-SingleChain has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile compared with octocog alfa and was well tolerated. The prolonged t1/2 , larger AUC and reduced CL of rVIII-SingleChain may permit longer dosing intervals, thereby improving patient adherence to prophylactic treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is an infrequent, serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). EPS may develop after kidney transplantation of PD-treated patients possibly due to the fibrotic effect of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Some experimental and clinical studies proposed inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for EPS management due to their anti-fibrotic and anti-angiogenesis effects. This review evaluated the therapeutic role of mTOR inhibitors in the management of EPS. METHOD: Thirteen case reports/series consisted of 20 patients (16 post-transplant and four post-hemodialysis EPS cases) were evaluated. We tried to extract the effect of mTOR inhibitors according to authors' conclusion and the time of improvement of patients' symptoms and each treatment modality such as surgery, parenteral nutrition, tamoxifen and mTOR inhibitors. RESULTS: Of 20 patients, clinical improvement of five patients (25%) is more attributable to mTOR inhibitor therapy. All these five patients were post-kidney transplant EPS cases. Therefore, EPS improvement rate in post-transplant EPS patients was 31.25% (5 of 16 patients). Death after EPS diagnosis occurred in two of seven patients with continued CNIs therapy (28.57%) and 1 of 11 cases (9.09%) who didn't receive CNIs after EPS diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Although the therapeutic effect of mTOR inhibitors against EPS remains unproven, it seems that for patients with post kidney transplant EPS who do not have any contraindication for mTOR inhibitor administration, converting from CNIs to mTOR inhibitors in addition to other EPS treatments may result in improving EPS in approximately one-third of patients and decreasing patients' mortality.",

Then, LDCFM uses the property that the null points of differential confocal response curves precisely correspond to the convergence points of the multi-reflected measuring beam to exactly determine the positions of the convergence points accurately. Subsequently, the position variation of the reflector is measured with different reflection times by using a distance-measuring instrument, and thereby the long focal length is measured precisely. Theoretical analyses and preliminary experimental results indicate that the LDCFM method has a relative expanded standard uncertainty (k=2) of 0.04% for the test lens with a focal length of 9.76 m. The LDCFM method can provide a novel approach for high-precision focal-length measurements.",

OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate signaling transduction pathways of H4R via ERK1/2, Akt and NFkappaB leading to the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, HMC-1 cells and CBMCs were pretreated individually with H4R antagonist JNJ7777120, H1R antagonist mepyramine and signaling molecule inhibitors PD 98059, LY294002, Bay 117082 followed by stimulation was done with or without histamine or 4-MH. Furthermore, the siRNA mediated H4R gene silencing effects are studied at the H4R protein expression level and also signal transduction level. RESULTS: We found that the pretreatment with JNJ7777120 and H4R gene silencing decreased histamine, 4-MH induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and NFkappaB-p65. Moreover, PD 98059, LY294002 and Bay 117082, which respectively inhibited the histamine and 4-methylhistamine induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt and NFkappaB-p65 respectively. We also found that the activation of H4R caused the release of IL-13 and RANTES on human mast cells. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked H4R mediated RANTES/CCL5 production by 20.33 pg/ml and inhibited IL-13 generation by 95.71 pg/ml. In contrast, PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 had no effect on 4-MH induced RANTES/CCL5 production but blocked IL-13 generation by 117.58 pg/ml. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the H4R activates divergent signaling pathways to induce cytokine and chemokine production in human mast cells.",

As LBPPTs have become more commercially available, they have become integrated into athletic performance and clinical rehabilitation settings. Consequentially, published research examining the biomechanical and physiological responses to unweighted running has increased. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize the literature in an attempt to provide researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive review of physiologic and biomechanical responses to LBPPT running. METHODS: Through a generic search of PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus using a comprehensive list of search terms related to LBPPT, unweighting, and body weight support during running, we identified all peer-reviewed publications that included LBPPT running. Two reviewers independently evaluated the quality of studies using a modified Downs and Black checklist for non-randomized studies. RESULTS: A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Peak and active vertical ground-reaction forces were consistently reduced with unweighting, but regional loading within the foot was also altered towards a forefoot strike. LBPPTs also provide some horizontal assistance. Neuromuscular activation is generally reduced with LBPPTs, but the stabilizer muscle groups may respond differently than the propulsive muscle groups. Submaximal heart rate and volume oxygen consumption are reduced with unweighting, but physiologic response remains generally unchanged at maximal intensities. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature suggests that LBPPTs are effective in allowing individuals to achieve a given metabolic stimulus with reduced musculoskeletal loading. However, LBPPTs not only reduce impact but also change neuromuscular activation and biomechanics in a complex manner. Thus, clinicians must account for the specific biomechanical and physiological alterations induced by LBPPTs when designing training programs and rehabilitation protocols.",

        "abstract": "1-Aminobenzotriazole (ABT) is a well-known in vivo nonspecific inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. An effective dosing regimen of ABT for a multiple-administration study is needed to conduct pharmacological studies for proof-of-concept, although it has been established for single-administration study, to characterize the pharmacokinetics of drug candidates. This study demonstrated a suitable dosing vehicle of ABT for continuous administration and increased exposure to antipyrine, which is a nonspecific probe of CYP, using ABT for a long period in mice. The dosing vehicle of ABT was 0.5% (w/v) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80 in N,N-dimethylacetamide/20% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin aqueous solution (2:8, v/v) based on the duration of apparent solubility. After implantation of an ALZET osmotic pump with ABT, the plasma concentrations of ABT were maintained at more than 4.1 mug/ml over 336 h. Compared with the vehicle group, the CLtot of antipyrine with ABT decreased to approximately one-fourth, and the BA of antipyrine with ABT increased up to 3-fold. In addition, the enhancement of exposure of antipyrine by ABT was maintained over the 336 h. The body weight, food consumption and hematological parameters of mice did not change with ABT administration for 16 days. These findings demonstrated that pretreatment of ABT can increase long-term exposure using continuous administration with the ALZET osmotic pump in mice with no overt toxicity. It is concluded that the in vivo use of 1-aminobenzotriazole can be applied to pharmacological studies for proof-of-concept, thus contributing to the selection of drug candidates at an early drug discovery stage.

        "abstract": "Tuning the intermolecular interactions among suitably designed molecules forming highly ordered self-assembled monolayers is a viable approach to control their organization at the supramolecular level. Such a tuning is particularly important when applied to sophisticated molecules combining functional units which possess specific electronic properties, such as electron/energy transfer, in order to develop multifunctional systems. Here we have synthesized two tetraferrocene-porphyrin derivatives that by design can selectively self-assemble at the graphite/liquid interface into either face-on or edge-on monolayer-thick architectures. The former supramolecular arrangement consists of two-dimensional planar networks based on hydrogen bonding among adjacent molecules whereas the latter relies on columnar assembly generated through intermolecular van der Waals interactions. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at the solid-liquid interface has been corroborated by cyclic voltammetry measurements and assessed by theoretical calculations to gain multiscale insight into the arrangement of the molecule with respect to the basal plane of the surface. The STM analysis allowed the visualization of these assemblies with a sub-nanometer resolution, and cyclic voltammetry measurements provided direct evidence of the interactions of porphyrin and ferrocene with the graphite surface and offered also insight into the dynamics within the face-on and edge-on assemblies. The experimental findings were supported by theoretical calculations to shed light on the electronic and other physical properties of both assemblies. The capability to engineer the functional nanopatterns through self-assembly of porphyrins containing ferrocene units is a key step toward the bottom-up construction of multifunctional molecular nanostructures and nanodevices.",

        "abstract": "GOAL: To study in vitro the antinematicide activity of soil streptomycetes metabolite and bioformulations based on them against root-knot, cyst and leaf nematodes of species. METHODS: Action of streptomycetes metabolites and their bioformulations were determined in vitro against larvae at two age of root-knot nematode M incognita (Kofoid & White, 1919) Chitwood 1949 and sugar beet cyst nematode H. schachtii A. Schmidt 1871, and leaf nematodes ofAphlenchoides genus by cultivation them in solutions of biomass ethanol extracts separate individual components metabolites and bioformulations during 24 hours. Nematicide and nematistatic effects of the substances were evaluated by the change in the motility activity of the nematodes. RESULTS: Soil streptomycetes S. violaceus IMV Ac-5027, S. averinitilis IMV Ac-5015 and metabolite bioformulations based on them (Violar, Aver- com and Avercom-nova, respectively) showed significant nematicidal activity against plant pathogenic nematodes M incognita and H. schachtii. The biomass extracts of S. avermiti- lis IMV Ac-5015 and S. violaceus IMV Ac-5027 caused 100 % death of nematodes, and S. netropsis IMV Ac-5025 caused only 75 % mortality during 24 hours of action. Using an antibiotic complex from S. violaceus IMV Ac-5027 was divided on six fractions that were different from the avermectin complex. Purified fractions of individual antibiotic complex of S. violaceus IMV Ac-5 027 have a negative impact against the root-knot nematode M incognita. The highest nematicidal activity showed fractions #4 and #5 since their efficiency was over 90 % after a 0.5 hours of action. Nematicidal efficiency of fractions ## 1, 2, 3 and 6 remained between 72.6-86.2 % during 24 hours of action. Fractions 4 and 5 showed high nematicidal effectiveness against leaf nematodes of Aphelenchoides genus where 90-95 % level of helminthes death was observed after 4 hours of action. Among created complex metabolite bioformulations Avercom-nova was the most effective which caused 100 % mortality of nematodes M incognita and H. schachtii after 24 hours of action. Bioformu- lation Violar caused 96.6-96.8 and 95.2-97.0 % of death of nematodes M incognita and H. schachtii, after 24 hours of action. Phytovit based on S. netropsis IMV Ac-5025 showed low nematicide activity against of nematodes, which did not exceed 15.2-18.4 % of their death after 24 hour of action. Bioformulations based on streptomycetes metabolites did not inferior to chemical insecticide Konfidor Maxi, which caused the death of 93.3-94.6 % nematodes at doses recommended by the manufacturer. CONCLUSION: Soil streptomycetes S. violaceus IV Ac-5027 and S. avermitilis IMV Ac-5015 are promising producers for creation of bioformulations with nematicidal activity against plant-parasitic nematode of M incoenita and H. schachtii.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is not only the most frequently diagnosed cancer, but also the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. This study aimed to screen the potential salivary biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis, staging, and biomarker discovery. For the first time, a UPLC-MS based method along with multivariate data analysis, was proposed for the global saliva metabonomics analysis and diagnosis of BC, which used both hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) separations and operated in both positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) ionization modes. On account of different polarities of endogenous metabolites, this method was established to overcome the boundedness of a single chromatographic approach. As a result, 18 potential metabolites for diagnosing BC were identified. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, heat map, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were exploited to analyze the data with the purpose of evaluating the predictive power of the 18 biomarkers. Significant differences (P<0.05) were disclosed in terms of the levels of the 18 potential biomarkers between BC patients and healthy controls (HC). Among the 18 biomarkers, three up-regulated metabolites, LysoPC (18:1), LysoPC (22:6) and MG (0:0/14:0/0:0) displayed the area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.920, 0.920 and 0.929, respectively, indicating the high accuracy of this method to predict BC. In this study, an integrated metabonomics analysis in human saliva for identifying potential biomarkers to diagnose and stage BC was successfully eastablished, which was non-invasive, reliable, low-cost, and simple. The HILIC was demonstrated to be essential for a comprehensive saliva metabonomics profiling as well as RPLC separation. This saliva metabonomics technique may provide new insight into the discovery and identification of diagnostic biomarkers for BC.",

We provide an overview of efforts, which extend to the period soon after the discovery of the penicillins, to develop clinically useful non-beta-lactam compounds as antibacterials, and, subsequently, penicillin-binding protein and beta-lactamase inhibitors. Like the beta-lactam inhibitors, avibactam works via a mechanism involving covalent modification of a catalytically important nucleophilic serine residue. However, unlike the beta-lactam inhibitors, avibactam reacts reversibly with its beta-lactamase targets. We discuss chemical factors that may account for the apparently special nature of beta-lactams and related compounds as antibacterials and beta-lactamase inhibitors, including with respect to resistance. Avenues for future research including non-beta-lactam antibacterials acting similarly to beta-lactams are discussed.",

The cases of HNC histologically confirmed in Senegal were then sent to the bio-pathology department of the Curie Institute in Paris to search HPVs. In the 90 included cases, the PCR technique was successful in 54 cases (60%). HPVs were found in seven cases, that is, a prevalence of 13%. HPVs were associated with 5 cases of hypopharyngeal carcinoma and 2 cases of carcinoma of the oral cavity. Patients with HNC HPV+ had a median age of 42 years against 49 years for HPV-patients. Three patients (42.8%) with HPV+ carcinomas were smokers. Of the 47 HPV-patients, 40 patients (87.1%) had alcohol intoxication and/or smoking. The concept of oral sex was refuted by all our patients. Squamous cell carcinoma was the only histological type found. HPV+ cell carcinoma showed no specific histological appearance. HPVs are another certain RF of HNC in Senegal. The major therapeutic and prognostic impact of HPVinduced cancers requires the systematic search of the viruses by the PCR technique.",

Histochemical staining showed the methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and wounding treatment induced the GUS gene expression specifically in the trichomes of transgenic A. thaliana, consistent with the results that the expression level of ALDH1 gene was increased in the A. annua under MeJA and wounding treatments. Two RAA motifs (AP2/ERF binding site) but no W box (WRKY binding site) motif were identified in the ALDH1 promoter by the analysis through PLACE and plantCARE. Through the dual luciferase reporter assay, we revealed that both AaORA and AaERF2, rather than AaWRKY1, could activate the expression of ALDH1 promoter.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Telephone assistance is a common practice in neurology, although there are only a few studies about this type of healthcare. We have evaluated a Telephone Assistance System (TAS) for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from 2 points of view: financially and according to the level of satisfaction of the caregiver. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 97 patients with a diagnosis of AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and their 97 informal caregivers were selected. We studied cost differences between on-site assistance and telephone assistance (TAS) for 12 months. We used a self-administered questionnaire to assess the level of satisfaction of caregivers at the end of the study period. RESULTS: TAS savings amounted to 80.05 +/- 27.07 euros per user. 73.6% of the caregivers consider TAS a better or much better system than on-site assistance, while only 2.6% of the caregivers considered TAS a worse or much worse system than on-site assistance. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone assistance systems are an efficient healthcare resource for monitoring patients with AD in neurology departments. Furthermore, the level of user satisfaction was high. We therefore consider that telephone assistance service should be offered by healthcare services.",

This study uses a marine ecosystem model to examine a comprehensive range of hypothetical CO2 leakage scenarios, quantifying both impact and recovery time within the benthic system. Whilst significant mortalities and long recovery times were projected for the larger and longer term scenarios, shorter-term or low level exposures lead to reduced projected impacts. This suggests that efficient monitoring and leak mitigation strategies, coupled with appropriate selection of storage sites can effectively limit concerns regarding localised environmental impacts from CCS. The feedbacks and interactions between physiological and ecological responses simulated reveal that benthic responses to CO2 leakage could be complex. This type of modelling investigation can aid the understanding of impact potential, the role of benthic community recovery and inform the design of baseline and monitoring surveys.",

METHODS: In a prospective case-control study, we included 50 alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU) patients, 50 age- and gender-matched patients with localized AA, and 50 age- and gender- matched healthy subjects between March 2015 and August 2015. Patients with AA were consecutively recruited from the hair disorders out-patient clinic of King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Thyroid autoantibodies (TAAs) were positive in AT/AU (40%), mild AA (14%), and healthy subjects (4%). The frequency of TAAs was significantly higher in patients with AT/AU than in mild AA (p=0.001) and healthy controls (p less than 0.001). The frequency of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Abs) was significantly higher in patients with AT/AU than in mild AA and healthy controls (p less than 0.001 for both). The frequency of TG-Abs was significantly higher in patients with AT/AU (p=0.003) and mild AA (p=0.043) than in healthy controls. Serum TSH level was significantly higher in AT/AU patients than in mild AA patients (p=0.006) and healthy controls (p=0.005). CONCLUSION: Severe subtype of AA is associated with a high risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. This highlights the significance of screening for thyroid abnormalities and TAAs in patients with AT/AU.",

Theoretically, children with high levels of perfectionism may show a decreased ability to control their emotions during times of perceived failure. Children may then worry as a maladaptive attempt to cope with intense emotions. The current study sought to test the mediating role of emotional control on the relation between perfectionism dimensions and worry in children. Participants were 66 parent-child dyads. Children were 7-13 years (50 % male; 77.3 % Caucasian, 9.1 % African American). Overall the model fit the data well. Results indicated that perfectionism domains predicted for emotional control deficits and increased worry. Emotional control also partially mediated the relation between perfectionism dimensions and worry. These results suggest that emotional control may be one mechanism through which perfectionism exerts its effect on worry and perfectionistic children may worry due to difficulty controlling their emotional responses.",

While for most synthetic materials, subjecting to repeated mechanical stress lower than their yield point would lead to structural failure. Here, it is reported that the graphene-based polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposite, a chemically and physically cross-linked system, exhibits an increase in the storage modulus under low-frequency, low-amplitude dynamic compressive loading. Cross-linking density statistics and molecular dynamics calculations show that the dynamic self-stiffening could be attributed to the increase in physical cross-linking density, resulted from the re-alignment and re-orientation of polymer chains along the surface of nano-fillers that constitute an interphase. Consequently, the interfacial interaction between PDMS-nano-fillers and the mobility of polymer chain, which depend on the degree of chemical cross-linking and temperature, are important factors defining the observed performance of self-stiffening. The understanding of the dynamic self-stiffening mechanism lays the ground for the future development of adaptive structural materials and bio-compatible, load-bearing materials for tissue engineering applications.",

Previous research shows that group members' social sensitivity is a potential antecedent of collective intelligence, yet it is still unclear whether individual or group-level indices are responsible for the positive association between social sensitivity and collective intelligence. In a comprehensive manner, we test the extent to which both compositional (lowest and highest individual score) and compilational aspects (emergent group level) of social sensitivity are associated with collective intelligence. This study has implications for research that explores groups as information processors, and for group design as it indicates how a group should be composed with respect to social sensitivity if the group is to reach high levels of collective intelligence. Our empirical results indicate that collectively intelligent groups are those in which the least socially sensitive group member has a rather high score on social sensitivity. Differently stated, (socially sensitive) group members cannot compensate for the lack of social sensitivity of the other group members.",

We retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of sedation-related complications in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 597 adult patients consecutively underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. The health status of the patients was screened according to a standardized protocol, and the patients were sedated by trained nonmedical sedation practitioners. Their vital signs were continuously monitored and recorded. All patients received oxygen, and the depth of sedation was continuously assessed and recorded. Mild and severe complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: All patients recovered uneventfully, and no mortality occurred. Overall, of the 597 sedated patients, 85 had mild and 4 had severe complications. Hypoxemia and upper airway obstruction, which were easily managed by trained nonmedical sedation practitioners, were the most common events. Hypotension was rare. No signs or symptoms suggestive of aspiration were reported. CONCLUSION: Moderate-to-deep sedation has been and continues to be a risky medical procedure. Serious complications of propofol/opioid-based sedation, especially respiratory and cardiovascular adverse events, may occur. These complications need to be recognized rapidly and appropriately managed. Our study shows that well-trained nonmedical sedation practitioners can be entrusted to take responsibility for the safe administration of moderate-to-deep sedation.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing, and when fine-needle aspiration biopsy results are cytologically indeterminate, the diagnosis is often still established only after thyroidectomy. Molecular marker testing may be helpful in guiding patient-oriented and tailored management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. OBJECTIVE: To summarize available data on the use of molecular testing to improve the diagnosis and prognostication of thyroid cancer. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A MEDLINE review was conducted using the primary search terms molecular, thyroid cancer, thyroid nodule, and gene expression classifier in search strings. Articles were restricted to those published between January 1, 2010, and June 1, 2015, inclusive of adult humans, and reported in the English language only. FINDINGS: Of 867 titles screened, 67 articles were further identified for review of the full text. The 2 most studied molecular marker testing techniques for indeterminate thyroid nodules include gene expression classifier analysis and evaluation for somatic mutations or rearrangements that are commonly found in thyroid cancer (7-gene panel). Nodules with benign results on gene expression classifier analysis can be associated with less than a 5% risk of cancer and may be observed, while nodules with positive results on the 7-gene panel may have a higher risk of cancer (80%-100%) and definitive surgery can be recommended. However, cancer prevalence and geographic variations in histologic subtypes may affect accuracy and clinical applicability of both tests. Molecular marker tests such as ThyroSeq version 2.1 are more comprehensive, but they need further validation. Preoperative risk stratification using molecular markers also may be used to better define the optimal extent of thyroidectomy for patients with thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Molecular markers potentially can augment the diagnostic specificity of fine-needle aspiration biopsy to better differentiate cytologically indeterminate nodules that can be safely observed from cytologically indeterminate nodules that may be associated with differentiated thyroid cancer. Long-term follow-up data are still needed; in the end, patient preference regarding the relative risks and benefits of molecular testing is at the crux of decision making.",

        "abstract": "The connections between the claustrum and the cortex in mouse are systematically investigated with adeno-associated virus (AAV), an anterograde viral tracer. We first define the boundary and the three-dimensional structure of the claustrum based on a variety of molecular and anatomical data. From AAV injections into 42 neocortical and allocortical areas, we conclude that most cortical areas send bilateral projections to the claustrum, the majority being denser on the ipsilateral side. This includes prelimbic, infralimbic, medial, ventrolateral and lateral orbital, ventral retrosplenial, dorsal and posterior agranular insular, visceral, temporal association, dorsal and ventral auditory, ectorhinal, perirhinal, lateral entorhinal, and anteromedial, posteromedial, lateroposterior, laterointermediate, and postrhinal visual areas. In contrast, the cingulate and the secondary motor areas send denser projections to the contralateral claustrum than to the ipsilateral one. The gustatory, primary auditory, primary visual, rostrolateral visual, and medial entorhinal cortices send projections only to the ipsilateral claustrum. Primary motor, primary somatosensory and subicular areas barely send projections to either ipsi- or contralateral claustrum. Corticoclaustral projections are organized in a rough topographic manner, with variable projection strengths. We find that the claustrum, in turn, sends widespread projections preferentially to ipsilateral cortical areas with different projection strengths and laminar distribution patterns and to certain contralateral cortical areas. Our quantitative results show that the claustrum has strong reciprocal and bilateral connections with prefrontal and cingulate areas as well as strong reciprocal connections with the ipsilateral temporal and retrohippocampal areas, suggesting that it may play a crucial role in a variety of cognitive processes.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is a promising prospective new treatment for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Neutralizing effects have been reported using monoclonal antibodies. Recombinant single chain antibodies (scFvs) due to their advantages over monoclonal antibodies are potential alternatives and provide valuable clinical agents. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to select specific single chain antibodies against gp55 of CMV and to evaluate their neutralizing effects. In the present study, we selected specific single chain antibodies against glycoprotein 55 (gp55) of CMV for their use in treatment and diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single chain antibodies specific against an epitope located in the C-terminal part of gp55 were selected from a phage antibody display library. After four rounds of panning, twenty clones were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fingerprinted by MvaI restriction enzyme. The reactivities of the specific clones were tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the neutralizing effects were evaluated by the plaque reduction assay. RESULTS: Fingerprinting of selected clones revealed three specific single chain antibodies (scFv1, scFv2 and scFv3) with frequencies 25%, 20 and 20%. The clones produced positive ELISA with the corresponding peptide. The percentages of plaque reduction for scFv1, scFv2 and scFv3 were 23.7, 68.8 and 11.6, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Gp55 of human CMV is considered as an important candidate for immunotherapy. In this study, we selected three specific clones against gp55. The scFvs reacted only with the corresponding peptide in a positive ELISA. The scFv2 with 68.8% neutralizing effect showed the potential to be considered for prophylaxis and treatment of CMV infections, especially in solid organ transplant recipients, for whom treatment of CMV is urgently needed. The scFv2 with neutralizing effect of 68.8%, has the potential to be considered for treatment of these patients. The specific scFv1 and scFv3 with lower neutralizing effects can be used for diagnostic purposes.",

        "abstract": "Mindfulness refers to an awareness that emerges by intentionally focusing on the present experience in a nonjudgmental or evaluative manner. Evidence regarding its efficacy has been increasing exponentially, and recent research suggests that the practice of meditation is associated with longer leukocyte telomere length. However, the psychological mechanisms underlying this potential relationship are unknown. We examined the telomere lengths of a group of 20 Zen meditation experts and another 20 healthy matched comparison participants who had not previously meditated. We also measured multiple psychological variables related to meditation practice. Genomic DNA was extracted for telomere measurement using a Life Length proprietary program. High-throughput quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (HT-Q-FISH) was used to measure the telomere length distribution and the median telomere length (MTL). The meditators group had a longer MTL (p = 0.005) and a lower percentage of short telomeres in individual cells (p = 0.007) than those in the comparison group. To determine which of the psychological variables contributed more to telomere maintenance, two regression analyses were conducted. In the first model, which applied to the MTL, the following three factors were significant: age, absence of experiential avoidance, and Common Humanity subscale of the Self Compassion Scale. Similarly, in the model that examined the percentage of short telomeres, the same factors were significant: age, absence of experiential avoidance, and Common Humanity subscale of the Self Compassion Scale. Although limited by a small sample size, these results suggest that the absence of experiential avoidance of negative emotions and thoughts is integral to the connection between meditation and telomeres.",

Up to 80% of patients are stage IV since the first diagnosis, presenting a 5-yr overall survival rate of 35%-55% and a twice higher mortality than limited disease. DNENs express somatostatin receptors in more than 80% of cases, detected through immunohistochemistry or functional imaging tests (FITs). This feature identifies patients who may benefit from \"cold\" somatostatin analogs (SSAs) or peptide receptors radionuclide therapy, although SSAs are sometimes used also with a negative uptake at FITs. The therapeutic options have been recently increased after the identification of molecular pathways involved in DNENs pathogenesis, and the subsequent use of targeted therapies (i.e., Everolimus and Sunitinib) for these neoplasms. This review offers an overview about pancreatic and small bowel NENs, critically underlining the issues that still need to be clarified and the future perspectives to be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that astrocyte activation, found in most forms of neural injury and disease, is linked to the hyperactivation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin. In many tissues and cell types, calcineurin hyperactivity is the direct result of limited proteolysis. However, little is known about the proteolytic status of calcineurin in activated astrocytes. Here, we developed a polyclonal antibody to a high activity calcineurin proteolytic fragment in the 45-48kDa range (DeltaCN) for use in immunohistochemical applications. When applied to postmortem human brain sections, the DeltaCN antibody intensely labeled cell clusters in close juxtaposition to amyloid deposits and microinfarcts. Many of these cells exhibited clear activated astrocyte morphology. The expression of DeltaCN in astrocytes near areas of pathology was further confirmed using confocal microscopy. Multiple NeuN-positive cells, particularly those within microinfarct core regions, also labeled positively for DeltaCN. This observation suggests that calcineurin proteolysis can also occur within damaged or dying neurons, as reported in other studies. When a similar DeltaCN fragment was selectively expressed in hippocampal astrocytes of intact rats (using adeno-associated virus), we observed a significant reduction in the strength of CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses, indicating that the hyperactivation of astrocytic calcineurin is sufficient for disrupting synaptic function. Together, these results suggest that proteolytic activation of calcineurin in activated astrocytes may be a central mechanism for driving and/or exacerbating neural dysfunction during neurodegenerative disease and injury.",

METHODS: A semi-rigid cast was used to restrict spinal motion during running. Subjects ran across a force platform at 3.6 m/s, planting the right foot on the platform. Data was collected from ten running trials with the cast and ten without the cast and analysed. RESULTS: Casted running showed that the initial vertical heel strike maximum was increased (p < .02) and that the anterior-posterior deceleration impulse was increased (p < .01). The maximum vertical ground reaction force was decreased in casted running (p < .01), as was the anterior-posterior acceleration impulse (p < .02). There was a trend for increased medial-lateral impulse in the uncasted state, but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal mobility and fascia contribute to load transfer between joints and body segments. Experimentally restricting spinal motion during running results in measurable and repeatable alterations in ground reaction force components. Alterations in load transfer due to decreased spinal motion may be a factor contributing to selected injuries in runners.",

RESULTS: Eleven percent failed the marksmanship and baton strike assessments, 21% failed defensive tactics and 36% failed the tactical options assessment. Mean Functional Movement Screen score was 13.96 points (+/-1.99 points). Only the tactical options assessment approached a significant difference (p = 0.077) between pass/fail recruits. When Functional Movement Screen scores when graded as pass (14+) or fail (<14) again only the tactical options assessment approached significance (p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that a relationship between an officer's movement patterns and occupational performance, most notably choice of tactical options, may exist.",

        "abstract": "The endothelins (ET) peptide family consists of ET-1, ET-2, ET-3, and sarafotoxin (s6C, a snake venom) and their actions appears to be different among isoforms. The aim of this study was to compare the secretagogue effect of ET-1 on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion with ET-3 and evaluate its physiological meaning. Isolated nonbeating atria from male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to evaluate stretch-activated ANP secretion in response to ET-1, ET-2, ET-3, and s6C. Changes in mean blood pressure (MAP) were measured during acute injection of ET-1 and ET-3 with and without natriuretic peptide receptor-A antagonist (A71915) in anesthetized rats. Changes in atrial volume induced by increased atrial pressure from o to 1, 2, 4, or 6cm H2O caused proportional increases in mechanically-stimulated extracellular fluid (ECF) translocation and stretch-activated ANP secretion. ET-1 (10nM) augmented basal and stretch-activated ANP secretion in terms of ECF translocation, which was blocked by the pretreatment with ETA receptor antagonist (BQ123, 1muM) but not by ETB receptor antagonist (BQ788, 1muM). ETA receptor antagonist itself suppressed stretch-activated ANP secretion. As compared to ET-1- induced ANP secretion (3.2-fold by 10nM), the secretagogue effects of ANP secretion by ET-2 was similar (2.8-fold by 10nM) and ET-3 and s6C were less potent (1.7-fold and 1.5-fold by 100nM, respectively). Acute injection of ET-1 or ET-3 increased mean blood pressure (MAP), which was augmented in the presence of natriuretic peptide receptor-A antagonist. Therefore, we suggest that the order of secretagogue effect of ET family on ANP secretion was ET-1>/=ET-2>>ET-3>s6C and ET-1-induced ANP secretion negatively regulates the pressor effect of ET-1.",

Yet, physicians' duties span personal health, public health, and safety spheres, and they often must address private patient matters. To prioritize gun safety and reduce gun injuries, the primary policy-driving question should be: will physician counseling on gun ownership effectively reduce gun-related injuries without interfering with the physician's other treatment obligations or compromising the physician-patient relationship? Existing data on physician-initiated conversations with patients about guns support a positive prevention effect. However, it is critical that physician-initiated discussions of safe gun practices are not motivated by, nor convey, disapproval of gun ownership. To be ethical, respectful, and efficient, the conversation should be standard between primary care providers and all of their patients (not limited to patient subsets); questions and education should be limited to topics of gun-ownership risks and storage practices; and the conversation must be framed without bias against gun ownership.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The presence of certain underlying medical conditions is known to increase the risk of pneumococcal disease in persons of all ages and across a wide spectrum of conditions, as demonstrated in two recent evaluations. Corresponding estimates of attributable economic costs have not been well characterized. We thus undertook a retrospective evaluation to estimate rates and costs of pneumococcal disease among children and adults with and without underlying medical conditions in the United States. METHODS: Data were obtained from three independent healthcare claims repositories. The study population included all persons enrolled in participating health plans during 2007-2010, and was stratified into subgroups based on age and risk profile: healthy; at-risk, due to selected comorbid conditions; and high-risk, due to selected immunocompromising conditions. At-risk and high-risk conditions, as well as episodes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and all-cause pneumonia (PNE), were identified via diagnosis, procedure, and drug codes. Rates and healthcare costs of IPD and PNE (2010US$) among at-risk and high-risk persons were compared with those from age-stratified healthy counterparts using incidence rate ratios (IRR) and cost ratios. RESULTS: Rates of IPD and PNE were consistently higher among at-risk persons (IRR = 4.1 [95 % CI 3.9-4.3] and 4.5 [4.49-4.53]) and high-risk persons (IRR = 10.3 [9.7-11.0] and 8.2 [8.2-8.3]) of all ages versus their healthy counterparts. Rates were notably high for at-risk persons with >/=2 conditions (IRR = 9.0 [8.4-9.7] and 10.3 [10.3-10.4]), as well as those with asthma (IRR = 3.4 [3.0-3.8] and 4.5 [4.47-4.53]) or diabetes (IRR = 4.3 [4.0-4.6] and 4.7 [4.6-4.7]). Healthcare costs totaled $21.7 million per 100,000 at-risk person-years and $58.5 million per 100,000 high-risk person-years, which were 8.7 [8.5-8.8] and 23.4 [22.9-23.8] times higher than corresponding costs for healthy persons. CONCLUSIONS: Rates and costs of IPD and PNE are substantially higher among persons with certain chronic and immunocompromising conditions versus those without any such conditions. Rates and costs for persons with asthma and diabetes were especially increased, and rates and costs for individuals with >/=2 at-risk conditions approached those among persons with high-risk conditions.",

We aimed to compare characteristics of patients with blood-culture-positive versus blood-culture-negative pneumococcal CAP, and to characterise bacteraemic serotypes.We describe a prospective, observational study on nonimmunocompromised patients with pneumococcal CAP, from 1996 to 2013. We define severe pneumonia according to American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.Of a total of 917 patients with pneumococcal CAP, 362 had blood-culture-positive pneumococcal pneumonia (BCPPP; 39%). High C-reactive protein (CRP) (>/=20 mg.dL(-1)) (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% CI 1.45-3.85), pleural effusion (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.13-3.65) and multilobar involvement (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.02-2.79) were independently associated with bacteraemic CAP, while nursing home resident (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-1.00) was found as a protective factor. Despite the clinical differences, BCPPP showed similar outcomes to blood-culture-negative pneumococcal pneumonia (BCNPP). 14% of the serotypes (period 2006-2013) causing bacteraemia are included in pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PVC7, 74% in pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PVC13 and 83% in pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine PPSV23.Pleural effusion, a high level of CRP and multilobar involvement predicted an increased risk of BCPPP. Although BCPPP patients were more severely ill at admission, mortality was not significantly greater than in BCNPP patients.",

Indeed, it is thought that such modifications may be responsible for the repeated infections of cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme with the N- and C-terminal domains catalyzing formylation and oxidative decarboxylation reactions, respectively. The catalytically competent cofactor for the formylation reaction is N(10) -formyltetrahydrofolate.

Between January 2007 and December 2013, 558 CF-LVADs were implanted (PSC = 464, 83.2%; DSC = 94, 16.8%). Among the six institutions implanting CF-LVADs, DSC practice ranged from 3.1% to 37.8%. Compared with PSC, the DSC group had higher body mass index (BMI), renal failure, anemia, IIb/IIIa inhibitor use, emergency surgery, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Delayed sternal closure patients had significantly longer bypass time (139 +/- 63 min vs. 107.6 +/- 42 min) and higher use of intraoperative blood products (82% vs. 69%) and right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support (4.3% vs. 0.2%). Postoperative morbidities and mortality (23.4% vs. 6.5%; p </= 0.0001) were higher in the DSC group compared with PSC. Mean hospital costs for DSC were higher than PSC ($249,144 +/- 123,273 vs. $155,915 +/- 95,032; p </= 0.0001). Multivariate predictors of DSC include institution with higher DSC practice, preoperative ECMO support, use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors, tricuspid valve surgery, and intraoperative red blood cell transfusion. Delayed sternal closure was an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality, odds ratio 3.0 (1.2-7.2).",

        "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, yet lacks effective neuroprotective treatments. The aim of this work was to investigate whether treatment with isorhamnetin protected the brain against ischemic injury in mice. Experimental stroke mice underwent the filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion. Treatment with isorhamnetin or vehicle was initiated immediately at the onset of reperfusion. It was found that treatment of experimental stroke mice with isorhamnetin reduced infarct volume and caspase-3 activity (a biomarker of apoptosis), and improved neurological function recovery. Treatment of experimental stroke mice with isorhamnetin attenuated cerebral edema, improved blood-brain barrier function, and upregulated gene expression of tight junction proteins including occludin, ZO-1, and claudin-5. Treatment of experimental stroke mice with isorhamnetin activated Nrf2/HO-1, suppressed iNOS/NO, and led to reduced formation of MDA and 3-NT in ipsilateral cortex. In addition, treatment of experimental stroke mice with isorhamnetin suppressed activity of MPO (a biomarker of neutrophil infiltration) and reduced protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in ipsilateral cortex. Furthermore, it was found that treatment of experimental stroke mice with isorhamnetin reduced mRNA and protein expression of NMDA receptor subunit NR1 in ipsilateral cortex. In conclusion, treatment with isorhamnetin protected the brain against ischemic injury in mice. Isorhamnetin could thus be envisaged as a countermeasure for ischemic stroke but remains to be tested in humans.",

        "abstract": "This paper elucidates the phytoremediation potential of water hyacinth and water lettuce on the reduction of wastewater toxicity. Acute toxicity tests were performed in an aquarium with a population of Sarotherodon melanotheron, contaminated by different concentrations of wastewaters before and after phytoremediation with Eichhornia crassipes and Pistia stratiotes. Lethal concentrations (LC50) of the fish's population obtained during 24 hours of exposures were determined. COD, BOD, ammonium, TKN and PO4(3-) concentrations in wastewaters were of 1850.29, 973.33, 38.34, 61.49 and 39.23 mg L(-1), respectively, for each plant. Phytoremediation reduced 58.87% of ammonium content, 50.04% of PO4(3-), 82.45% of COD and 84.91% of BOD. After 15 days of the experiment, metal contents in treated wastewaters decreased from 6.65 to 97.56% for water hyacinth and 3.51 to 93.51% for water lettuce tanks. Toxicity tests showed that the mortality of fish exposed increased with increase in concentration of pollutants in wastewaters and the time of exposure. Therefore, the highest value of LC50 was recorded for fish subjected to 3 hours of exposure (16.37%). The lowest rate was obtained after an exposure of 20 to 24 hours (5.85%). After phytoremediation, the effluents purified by Eichhornia crassipes can maintain the fish life beyond 24 hours of exposure.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ageing is accompanied by an increased risk of disease and a loss of functioning on several bodily and mental domains and some argue that maintaining health and functioning is essential for a successful old age. Paradoxically, studies have shown that overall wellbeing follows a curvilinear pattern with the lowest point at middle age but increases thereafter up to very old age. OBJECTIVE: To shed further light on this paradox, we reviewed the existing literature on how scholars define successful ageing and how they weigh the contribution of health and functioning to define success. METHODS: We performed a novel, hypothesis-free and quantitative analysis of citation networks exploring the literature on successful ageing that exists in the Web of Science Core Collection Database using the CitNetExplorer software. Outcomes were visualized using timeline-based citation patterns. The clusters and sub-clusters of citation networks identified were starting points for in-depth qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Within the literature from 1902 through 2015, two distinct citation networks were identified. The first cluster had 1146 publications and 3946 citation links. It focused on successful ageing from the perspective of older persons themselves. Analysis of the various sub-clusters emphasized the importance of coping strategies, psycho-social engagement, and cultural differences. The second cluster had 609 publications and 1682 citation links and viewed successful ageing based on the objective measurements as determined by researchers. Subsequent sub-clustering analysis pointed to different domains of functioning and various ways of assessment. CONCLUSION: In the current literature two mutually exclusive concepts of successful ageing are circulating that depend on whether the individual himself or an outsider judges the situation. These different points of view help to explain the disability paradox, as successful ageing lies in the eyes of the beholder.",

As a whole, it provides easy access to the interactomes from specific species and includes a global uniform compendium of 90,379 distinct proteins and 678,441 singular interactions. APID integrates and unifies PPIs from major primary databases of molecular interactions, from other specific repositories and also from experimentally resolved 3D structures of protein complexes where more than two proteins were identified. For this purpose, a collection of 8,388 structures were analyzed to identify specific PPIs. APID also includes a new graph tool (based on Cytoscape.js) for visualization and interactive analyses of PPI networks.

Plasminogen interaction with these sites initiates the activation process of proenzyme and subsequent fibrin lysis. In this study we investigated the binding of plasminogen fragments K 1-3 and K 5 with fibrin fragment DD and their effect on Glu-plasminogen interaction with DD. It was shown that the level of Glu-plasminogen binding to fibrin fragment DD is decreased by 50-60% in the presence of K 1-3 and K 5. Fragments K 1-3 and K 5 have high affinity to fibrin fragment DD (Kd is 0.02 for K 1-3 and 0.054 mucapital EM, Cyrillic for K 5). K 5 interaction is independent and K 1-3 is partly dependent on C-terminal lysine residues. K 1-3 interacts with complex of fragment DD-immobilized K 5 as well as K 5 with complex of fragment DD-immobilized K 1-3. The plasminogen fragments do not displace each other from binding sites located in fibrin fragment DD, but can compete for the interaction. The results indicate that fibrin fragment DD contains different binding sites for plasminogen kringle fragments K 1-3 and K 5, which can be located close to each other. The role of amino acid residues of fibrin molecule capital A, Cyrillicalpha148-160 region in interaction with fragments K 1-3 and K 5 is discussed.",

Group MTX received normal drinking water, group MTX+INS0.5 received 0.5 U/mL insulin, and group MTX+INS1 received 1 U/mL insulin in drinking water. The severity of mucositis was determined by intake, bodyweight, illness, and plasma citrulline. In the recovery phase, the function of the gut was tested with an oral glucose tolerance test, and villus and crypt length of the small intestine were measured. RESULTS: MTX-induced mucositis in all 3 groups and oral insulin did not cause a change in the severity of mucositis, with comparable bodyweight, food intake, and water intake. Oral insulin did not alter the enterocyte mass, determined with plasma citrulline. The glucose level after bolus was higher in the MTX group than the MTX+INS1 group (P < 0.05). Histology was not significant different between all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral insulin does not alter the severity or the acceleration of recovery of mucositis. Therefore, we conclude that it is not useful to further study oral insulin as possible intervention to prevent or treat chemotherapy-induced GI mucositis.",

Biomechanical properties were assessed in terms of stability by measuring swelling in aqueous environments, investigating wettability using contact angle tests, and evaluating bioadhesive performance. The ductility of the materials was evaluated through stress-strain measurements and the morphology was explored by scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the incorporation of itaconic acid improved most of the desirable properties, increasing adhesiveness and reducing wettability and swelling. The use of triacetin enhanced the strength, bioadhesiveness, and ductility of the material.",

It has been suggested that augmented expression of NPR-C as a cause for the diminished anti-hypertrophic action of natriuretic peptides in the failing heart. Hence, we sought to determine the level of Npr3 gene (coding for NPR-C) expression in the Isoproterenol (ISO) treated Wistar rats. In addition, we studied the effect of Npr3 gene silencing on the hypertrophic growth. A significant increase in heart weight-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW-24%,P<0.01), an indicator of cardiac hypertrophic growth was observed in the ISO (10mg/kg BW/day,i.p for 7 days) treated rats. As expected, the cardiac NPR-C protein expression was significantly increased by 4 fold as compared to control rats. In parallel, the circulatory atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) level was significantly decreased (2 fold) in ISO treated rats. Upon treatment with siRNA-Npr3, a significant decrease in the cardiac NPR-C protein expression (70%,P<0.01), HW/BW ratio (70%,P<0.01) and hypertrophic marker genes (alpha-Sk, beta-MHC, c-fos, P<0.01, respectively) mRNA expression were observed. Interestingly, the circulatory ANP level was increased by 1.5 fold in the siRNA-Npr3 treated rats as compared to ISO treated rats. Moreover, the cardiac collagen content, matrixmetalloprotinases-2 (MMP-2) and enzymatic antioxidant status (P<0.01, respectively) were found to be restored back to near normal upon siRNA-Npr3 treatment. Taken together, the results of this study indicates that specific down-regulation of Npr3 gene improves the circulatory levels of ANP and antioxidant system and there by attenuates the beta-adrenoceptor over-activation mediated cardiac hypertrophic growth in experimental rats.",

Moreover, lakes of different dimensions and even in remote locations contain microplastics in striking abundances. This study investigates concentrations of microplastic particles at two lakes in central Italy (Lake Bolsena, Lake Chiusi). A total number of six Manta Trawls have been carried out, two of them one day after heavy winds occurred on Lake Bolsena showing effects on particle distribution of fragments and fibers of varying size categories. Additionally, 36 sediment samples from lakeshores were analyzed for microplastic content. In the surface waters 2.68 to 3.36 particles/m(3) (Lake Chiusi) and 0.82 to 4.42 particles/m(3) (Lake Bolsena) were detected, respectively. Main differences between the lakes are attributed to lake characteristics such as surface and catchment area, depth and the presence of local wind patterns and tide range at Lake Bolsena. An event of heavy winds and moderate rainfall prior to one sampling led to an increase of concentrations at Lake Bolsena which is most probable related to lateral land-based and sewage effluent inputs. The abundances of microplastic particles in sediments vary from mean values of 112 (Lake Bolsena) to 234 particles/kg dry weight (Lake Chiusi). Lake Chiusi results reveal elevated fiber concentrations compared to those of Lake Bolsena what might be a result of higher organic content and a shift in grain size distribution towards the silt and clay fraction at the shallow and highly eutrophic Lake Chiusi. The distribution of particles along different beach levels revealed no significant differences.",

BACKGROUND: A bicuspid AS is often considered a relative contraindication to TAVR. Although initial reports have demonstrated feasibility using early-generation devices, outcomes have not matched those seen with tricuspid AS. Paravalvular aortic regurgitation (AR) has been particularly problematic. METHODS: We collected baseline characteristics, procedural data, and 30-day clinical follow-up findings from 8 centers in Europe and Canada that had performed TAVR in bicuspid AS using the SAPIEN 3 valve. RESULTS: 51 patients underwent TAVR using the SAPIEN 3 valve. Patient mean age was 76.2 +/- 9.3 years and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality scores were 5.2 +/- 3.7%. Bicuspid valve types were: type 0, 11.8%; type 1, 82.3%; and type 2, 1.9%. There were no cases of valve embolization or need for a second valve. Post-dilation was performed in 7.8%. The mean aortic gradient decreased from 49.4 +/- 16.0 mm Hg to 11.2 +/- 4.7 mm Hg. Post-implantation AR was none/trivial in 63% and mild in 37%. There were no cases of moderate or severe AR. At 30-day follow-up, there were 2 deaths (3.9%), 2 major vascular complications, and 12 patients (23.5%) required pacemaker implantation. CONCLUSIONS: TAVR in bicuspid AS using a new-generation device was feasible and effective with favorable valve performance and no cases of moderate or severe AR.",

METHODS: Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2012 were used for the analyses. The pure tones at 0.5 and 1 kHz of both ears of each subject were averaged to obtain the low-frequency, those at 2 and 3 kHz were averaged to obtain the mid-frequency, and those at 4 and 6 kHz were averaged to obtain the high-frequency. The average hearing threshold (AHT) was calculated as pure tone average at 4 frequencies in the better ear. ARHL was defined as the AHT >25 dB. RESULTS: Univariate analyses revealed an increase in the BMI tertile in men was associated with a decreased low-frequency threshold, while an increase in the BMI tertile in women was associated with decreased mid- and high-frequency thresholds. Multivariate analyses adjusted for confounders show no significant differences in low-, mid-, or high-frequency. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of ARHL by BMI tertiles. Linear regression analyses show no association between BMI and low-, mid-, and high-frequency or AHTs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values for AHT was 0.515 in men and 0.522 in women. The logistic regression analyses showed no association between BMI and ARHL in either sex. CONCLUSION: BMI is not advantageous for the prediction of ARHL. In future epidemiological studies, BMI as a covariate of obesity may be replaced by other active metabolic parameters that have better predictive ability of ARHL than BMI.",

To enhance marbling, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating adipogenesis is needed. Vitamin A has recently been shown to have a profound impact on all stages of adipogenesis. Retinoic acid, an active metabolite of vitamin A, activates both retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), inducing epigenetic changes in key regulatory genes governing adipogenesis. Additionally, Vitamin D and folates interact with the retinoic acid receptors to regulate adipogenesis. In this review, we discuss nutritional regulation of adipogenesis, focusing on retinoic acid and its impact on epigenetic modifications of key adipogenic genes.",

In Southern China, the E2-A subtype is significantly more frequent in NPCs than TWs, and is also more common than in Northern China.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the main factors influencing metabolic changes in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). METHODS: We prospectively studied 114 patients with MTLE (62 female; 60 left HS; 15- to 56-year-olds) with (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and correlated the results with the side of HS, structural atrophy, electroclinical features, gender, age at onset, epilepsy duration, and seizure frequency. Imaging processing was performed using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: Ipsilateral hypometabolism involved temporal (mesial structures, pole, and lateral cortex) and extratemporal areas including the insula, frontal lobe, perisylvian regions, and thalamus, more extensively in right HS (RHS). A relative increase of metabolism (hypermetabolism) was found in the nonepileptic temporal lobe and in posterior areas bilaterally. Voxel-based morphometry detected unilateral hippocampus atrophy and gray matter concentration decrease in both frontal lobes, more extensively in left HS (LHS). Regardless of the structural alterations, the topography of hypometabolism correlated strongly with the extent of epileptic networks (mesial, anterior-mesiolateral, widespread mesiolateral, and bitemporal according to the ictal spread), which were larger in RHS. Notably, widespread perisylvian and bitemporal hypometabolism was found only in RHS. Mirror hypermetabolism was grossly proportional to the hypometabolic areas, coinciding partly with the default mode network. Gender-related effect was significant mainly in the contralateral frontal lobe, in which metabolism was higher in female patients. Epilepsy duration correlated with the contralateral temporal metabolism, positively in LHS and negatively in RHS. Opposite results were found with age at onset. High seizure frequency correlated negatively with the contralateral metabolism in LHS. SIGNIFICANCE: Epileptic networks, as assessed by electroclinical correlations, appear to be the main determinant of hypometabolism in MTLE. Compensatory mechanisms reflected by a relative hypermetabolism in the nonepileptic temporal lobe and in extratemporal areas seem more efficient in LHS and in female patients, whereas long duration, late onset of epilepsy, and high seizure frequency may reduce these adaptive changes.",

        "abstract": "Amylin is an important, but poorly understood, 37 amino acid glucoregulatory hormone with great potential to target metabolic diseases. A working example that the amylin system is one worth developing is the FDA-approved drug used in insulin-requiring diabetic patients, pramlintide. However, certain characteristics of pramlintide pharmacokinetics and formulation leave considerable room for further development of amylin-mimetic compounds. Given that amylin-mimetic drug design and development is an active area of research, surprisingly little is known about the structure/function relationships of amylin. This is largely due to the unfavourable aggregative and solubility properties of the native peptide sequence, which are further complicated by the composition of amylin receptors. These are complexes of the calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying proteins. This review explores what is known of the structure-function relationships of amylin and provides insights that can be drawn from the closely related peptide, CGRP. We also describe how this information is aiding the development of more potent and stable amylin mimetics, including peptide hybrids.",

        "abstract": "During the last decades, the level of income inequality in China has increased dramatically. Despite rapid economic growth and improved living conditions, the health performance in China has dropped compared to the period before the economic reform. The \"Wilkinson hypothesis\" suggests that increased income inequality in a society is correlated to worse health performance. China is a particular interesting case due to the rapid socioeconomic change in the country. This study uses the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) to address the question of whether income inequality has an impact on individuals' risks of having health problems in China. Unlike previous studies with health measures such as self-reported health or mortality rate, our study uses physical functions to measure individual health. By analysing panel data using county/city-level dummies and year fixed-effects, we found that income inequality does not have a significant impact on individuals' risks of having health problems. This result is robust when changing between different indicators for income inequality.",

        "abstract": "A major progress in deep multilayer neural networks (DNNs) is the invention of various unsupervised pretraining methods to initialize network parameters which lead to good prediction accuracy. This paper presents the sparseness analysis on the hidden unit in the pretraining process. In particular, we use the L(1) -norm to measure sparseness and provide some sufficient conditions for that pretraining leads to sparseness with respect to the popular pretraining models-such as denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Our experimental results demonstrate that when the sufficient conditions are satisfied, the pretraining models lead to sparseness. Our experiments also reveal that when using the sigmoid activation functions, pretraining plays an important sparseness role in DNNs with sigmoid (Dsigm), and when using the rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation functions, pretraining becomes less effective for DNNs with ReLU (Drelu). Luckily, Drelu can reach a higher recognition accuracy than DNNs with pretraining (DAEs and RBMs), as it can capture the main benefit (such as sparseness-encouraging) of pretraining in Dsigm. However, ReLU is not adapted to the different firing rates in biological neurons, because the firing rate actually changes along with the varying membrane resistances. To address this problem, we further propose a family of rectifier piecewise linear units (RePLUs) to fit the different firing rates. The experimental results show that the performance of RePLU is better than ReLU, and is comparable with those with some pretraining techniques, such as RBMs and DAEs.",

        "abstract": "Most natural environments are characterized by frequent changes of their abiotic conditions. Microorganisms can respond to such changes by switching their physiological state between activity and dormancy allowing them to endure periods of unfavorable abiotic conditions. As a consequence, the competitiveness of microbial species is not simply determined by their growth performance under favorable conditions but also by their ability and readiness to respond to periods of unfavorable environmental conditions. The present study investigates the relevance of factors controlling the abundance and activity of individual bacterial species competing for an intermittently supplied substrate. For this purpose, numerical experiments were performed addressing the response of microbial systems to regularly applied feeding pulses. Simulation results show that community dynamics may exhibit a non-trivial link to the frequency of the external constraints and that for a certain combination of these environmental conditions coexistence of species is possible. The ecological implication of our results is that even non-dominant, neglected species can have a strong influence on realized species composition of dominant key species, due to their invisible presence enable the coexistence between important key species and by this affecting provided function of the system.",

In addition to well-known clinical characteristics such as short stature and gonadal failure, TS is also associated with T cell immune alterations and chronic otitis media, suggestive of a possible immune deficiency. Recently, ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat on the X chromosome (UTX), a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, has been identified as a downregulated gene in TS immune cells. Importantly, UTX is an X-linked gene that escapes X-chromosome inactivation and thus is haploinsufficient in TS. Mice with T cell-specific UTX deficiency have impaired clearance of chronic viral infection due to decreased frequencies of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which are critical for B cell antibody generation. In parallel, TS patients have decreased Tfh frequencies in peripheral blood. Together, these findings suggest that haploinsufficiency of the X-linked UTX gene in TS T cells underlies an immune deficit, which may manifest as increased predisposition to chronic otitis media.",

Oxidative stress-mediated damage to mitochondrial DNA promotes atherosclerosis in animal models. Thus, we evaluated the relation of mitochondrial DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells s with vascular function in patients with diabetes mellitus and with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We assessed non-invasive vascular function and mitochondrial DNA damage in 275 patients (age 57 +/- 9 years, 60 % women) with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease alone (N = 55), diabetes mellitus alone (N = 74), combined atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (N = 48), and controls age >45 without diabetes mellitus or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (N = 98). Mitochondrial DNA damage measured by quantitative PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was higher with clinical atherosclerosis alone (0.55 +/- 0.65), diabetes mellitus alone (0.65 +/- 1.0), and combined clinical atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus (0.89 +/- 1.32) as compared to control subjects (0.23 +/- 0.64, P < 0.0001). In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, and relevant cardiovascular risk factors, clinical atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus remained associated with higher mitochondrial DNA damage levels (beta = 0.14 +/- 0.13, P = 0.04 and beta = 0.21 +/- 0.13, P = 0.002, respectively). Higher mitochondrial DNA damage was associated with higher baseline pulse amplitude, a measure of arterial pulsatility, but not with flow-mediated dilation or hyperemic response, measures of vasodilator function. CONCLUSIONS: We found greater mitochondrial DNA damage in patients with diabetes mellitus and clinical atherosclerosis. The association of mitochondrial DNA damage and baseline pulse amplitude may suggest a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive small artery pulsatility with potentially adverse microvascular impact.",

During tumor development, cancer cells are facing intrinsic (oncogene activation) and extrinsic (limiting nutrient or oxygen supply; exposure to chemotherapies) challenges, with which they must cope to survive. Primary brain tumors are relatively rare but deadly and present a significant challenge in the determination of risk factors in the population. These tumors are inherently difficult to cure because of their protected location in the brain. As such surgery, radiation and chemotherapy options carry potentially lasting patient morbidity and incomplete tumor cure. Some of these tumors, such as glioblastoma, were reported to present features of ER stress and to depend on UPR activation to sustain growth, but to date there is no clear general representation of the ER stress status in primary brain tumors. In this review, we describe the key molecular mechanisms controlling the UPR and their implication in cancers. Then we extensively review the literature reporting the status of ER stress in various primary brain tumors and discuss the potential impact of such observation on patient stratification and on the possibility of developing appropriate targeted therapies using the UPR as therapeutic target.",

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is exploring ways to meet the demand for access to CIH, but little is known about Veterans' perceptions of the VA's efforts. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted interviews of 15 inpatients, 8 receiving palliative care, and 15 outpatients receiving CIH in the VA. Pain was the precipitating factor in all participants' experience. Participants were asked about their experience in the VA and their opinions about which therapies would most benefit other Veterans. Participants reported that massage was well-received and resulted in decreased pain, increased mobility, and decreased opioid use. Major challenges were the high ratio of patients to CIH providers, the difficulty in receiving CIH from fee-based CIH providers outside of the VA, cost issues, and the role of administrative decisions in the uneven deployment of CIH across the VA. If the VA is to meet its goal of offering personalized, proactive, patient-centered care nationwide then it must receive support from Congress while considering Veterans' goals and concerns to ensure that the expanded provision of CIH improves outcomes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore oncologist's grief symptoms over patient death and to identify why and which losses are particularly challenging when patients die. METHODS: The grounded theory method was used to collect and analyze the data. Twenty-two oncologists were interviewed between March 2013 and June 2014 from three adult oncology centers in the north, center, and south of Israel. Oncologists were at different stages of their careers and varied in their sub-specialties, gender, and personal and professional backgrounds. RESULTS: Grief begun when the patient died, in anticipation of the patient's death, many days after the death, or when the patient received a poor prognosis. The phenomenological experience of grief for oncologists included behavioral, cognitive, physical, and emotional symptoms in response to patient death. Behavioral symptoms included crying and difficulties sleeping. Cognitive symptoms included self-doubt and rumination about the patient and the care the patient had received before death. Physical symptoms included chest pain, fatigue, and general physical discomfort. Emotional symptoms included sadness, anxiety, helplessness, guilt, relief, irritability, and loss. Difficult patient loss was caused by patient-related factors, family-related factors, and disease-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patient deaths result in behavioral, cognitive, physical, and emotional symptoms of grief in oncologists. These symptoms become particularly intense in the context of patient, family, and disease-related factors. Educational and supportive interventions for managing grief related to patient death are needed in order to support oncologists in their emotionally and mentally taxing work.

Administration of post-surgical analgesics is an important consideration for animal welfare, but the actions of the analgesic must not interfere with the scientific goals of the experiment. In this study, we show that treatment with either buprenorphine or acetaminophen following a bilateral sciatic nerve crush surgery does not alter the expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons of a panel of genes associated with wound healing. These findings indicate that the post-operative use of buprenorphine or acetaminophen at doses commonly suggested by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees does not change the intrinsic gene expression response of DRG neurons to a sciatic nerve crush injury, for many wound healing-associated genes. Therefore, administration of post-operative analgesics may not confound the results of transcriptomic studies employing this injury model.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevation of ST segment in leads V3R/ V4R, which is commonly encountered in right ventricular myocardial infarction, may also occur in patients with anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the clinical impact of this finding in the setting of anterior myocardial infarction is not well understood. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of ST segment elevation in leads V3R/V4R in patients with first acute anterior myocardial infarction. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Right precordial leads V3R/V4R were recorded in 111 patients admitted with first time anterior myocardial infarction. Patients were allocated into two groups based on the presence or absence of ST elevation in leads V3R/V4R. Demographic, biochemical and echocardiographic data, as well as the angiographic information, were recorded. In-hospital and 3 month mortality, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), death, heart failure and ventricular dysrhythmia were also compared. RESULTS: ST elevation in lead V3R or V4R was present in 72 out of 111 patients (64.9%). Involvement of the proximal part of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was not different in the two groups (44.4% of patients with elevation vs. 53.8% of patients without elevation, p=0.22). Post-myocardial infarction complications, mortality and major adverse cardiac events were similar in the two groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower in patients with ST elevation in V3R/V4R (35 %+/-8 vs. 38 %+/-8, p=0.02). Twenty three out of 111 patients (20.7%) developed heart failure, which was similar in the two groups [16 (22.2%) of patients with ST elevation vs. 7 (17.9%) of patients without ST elevation, p=0.39]. CONCLUSION: Although ST elevation in V3R/V4R can be present in patients with left anterior descending artery occlusion, it does not seem to predict the prognosis. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction in this group may play a role in the long-term prognosis; however, this issue needs further investigation.",

In addition, the primary factor for dislocation in most of these cases was considered to be osteophytes in the inferior pole of the patella and the anterior surface of the femoral condyle; only 1 case had no osteophytes. We treated a 19-year-old woman who sustained a painful locking of the left knee after colliding with a friend. Plain radiography and computed tomography showed superior-lateral dislocation of the patella and an interlocking between notches in the inferior pole of the patella and the anterior surface of the femoral condyle. Closed reduction without sedation was performed without difficulty, and the patient was able to walk home without pain. After 1 week, the knee was without problems. The patient had no osteophytes in the knee and had no other common risk factors, such as patella alta, ligamentous laxity, genu recurvatum, and paralytic disorders. After a comparison with previously reported cases of superior patella dislocation, we concluded that the primary factor in the present case might have been a different condition.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia is one of the most common causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality in the world. We built a Database for Preeclampsia (dbPEC) consisting of the clinical features, concurrent conditions, published literature and genes associated with Preeclampsia. We included gene sets associated with severity, concurrent conditions, tissue sources and networks. The published scientific literature is the primary repository for all information documenting human disease. We used semantic data mining to retrieve and extract the articles pertaining to preeclampsia-associated genes and performed manual curation. We deposited the articles, genes, preeclampsia phenotypes and other supporting information into the dbPEC. It is publicly available and freely accessible. Previously, we developed a database for preterm birth (dbPTB) using a similar approach. Using the gene sets in dbPTB, we were able to successfully analyze a genome-wide study of preterm birth including 4000 women and children. We identified important genes and pathways associated with preterm birth that were not otherwise demonstrable using genome-wide approaches. dbPEC serves not only as a resources for genes and articles associated with preeclampsia, it is a robust source of gene sets to analyze a wide range of high-throughput data for gene set enrichment analysis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin regulates glucose homeostasis through direct effects on the liver, among other organs, with leptin modulating insulin's hepatic actions. Since central leptin may modify insulin signaling in the liver, we hypothesized that leptin infusion activates hepatic glycogen synthesis following peripheral administration of a bolus of glucose or insulin, thus regulating glycemia. FINDINGS: Oral glucose and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed in control, intracerebroventricular leptin-treated and pair-fed rats during 14 days. An improvement in glycemia and an increase in hepatic free glucose and glycogen concentrations after glucose or insulin overload were observed in leptin-treated rats. In order to analyze whether the liver was involved in these changes, we studied activation of insulin signaling by Western blotting and multiplex bead immunoassay after leptin infusion. Our studies revealed an increase in phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Akt in leptin-treated rats. Examination of parameters related to glucose uptake and metabolism in the liver revealed an augment in glucose transporter 2 and a decrease in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase protein levels in this group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that central leptin increases hepatic insulin signaling, associated with increased glycogen concentrations after glucose or insulin overload, leading to an improvement in glycemia.",

METHOD: Children 2 to 14 years of age with abdominal pain suggesting acute appendicitis (AA) were prospectively included. Procalcitonin, calprotectin, C-reactive protein, white blood count, ANC, and the new plasma APPY1 Test were performed. The final diagnosis was determined by histopathology in cases of AA and telephone follow-up in children discharged without AA. RESULTS: Between February 2012 and June 2013, 185 children were enrolled with an average age of 9.32+/-2.7 years. Eighty-nine (48.1%) were finally diagnosed with AA. The APPY1 Test panel showed the highest discriminatory power, sensitivity of 97.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.2-99.4), negative predictive value of 95.1 (95% CI, 83.9-98.7), negative likelihood ratio of 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01-0.22), and specificity of 40.6 (95% CI, 31.3-50.5). A negative APPY1 Test and ANC less than 7500 per milliliter provided a sensitivity of 100 (95% CI, 95.9-100), negative predictive value of 100 (95% CI, 89.8-100), and specificity of 35.4 (95% CI, 26.6-45.4). In the multivariate analysis, only the APPY1 Test and ANC greater than 7500 per milliliter were significant risk factors for AA (odds ratio, 13.76; 95% CI, 3.02-62.57, and odds ratio, 6.37; 95% CI, 2.89-14.28, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The APPY1 Test panel with ANC could be useful in identifying children with abdominal pain suggestive of AA who are at low risk for this disease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of serum lactate levels and early lactate clearance with survival to hospital discharge for patients suffering an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed of patients with OHCA transported by ambulance to two adult tertiary hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. Exclusion criteria were traumatic cardiac arrest, return of spontaneous circulation prior to the arrival of the ambulance, age less than 18 years and no serum lactate levels recorded. Serum lactate levels recorded for up to 48 h post-arrest were obtained from the hospital clinical information system, and lactate clearance over 48 h was calculated. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: There were 518 patients with lactate values, of whom 126 (24.3%) survived to hospital discharge. Survivors and non-survivors had different mean initial lactate levels (mean +/- SD 6.9 +/- 4.7 and 12.2 +/- 5.5 mmol/L, respectively; P < 0.001). Lactate clearance was higher in survivors. Lactate levels for non-survivors did not decrease below 2 mmol/L until at least 30 h after the ambulance call. CONCLUSION: In OHCA patients who had serum lactate levels measured, both lower initial serum lactate and early lactate clearance in the first 48 h following OHCA were associated with increased likelihood of survival. However, the use of lactate in isolation as a predictor of survival or neurological outcome is not recommended. Prospective studies that minimise selection bias are required to determine the clinical utility of serum lactate levels in OHCA patients.",

METHODOLOGY: The records of 29,210 patients with infectious diarrhea in the outpatient department of the Jinshan Hospital (Shanghai, China) between January 1998 and December 2013 were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 2,849 samples were positive for intestinal pathogenic bacteria including Vibrio parahaemolyticus (2,489; 84.0%), Salmonella spp. (235; 8.3%), and Shigella spp. (125; 4.4%). V. parahaemolyticus infections are mainly characterized by abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, whereas Shigella spp. infections can, in addition, induce fever. In contrast, Salmonella infections can produce all of these symptoms but in a smaller percentage of patients. During the 16-year study, both the number of patients and the positive infection rate declined. Notably, the rate of infections by V. parahaemolyticus decreased while the detection rates of Salmonella spp. increased year by year from 2006 on with the introduction of a new detection method. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella has been identified as the third-most frequent cause of diarrhea from 1998-2006, as the second-most frequent cause from 2006-2010, and as the most frequent cause from 2011-2013, which was mainly due to a sharp decrease of V. parahaemolyticus infections in 2011-2013. Salmonella strains collected in 2011-2013 showed high susceptibility to imipenem (100%) and meropenem (100%), whereas susceptibilities for ampicillin (39%) and piperacillin (40%) were low.",

Increasing food allergy prevalence poses a major public health concern. Induction of desensitization to food allergens through oral immunotherapy (OIT) is an expanding area of study encompassing peanut, egg, milk, and other food allergens. OIT consists of administering incremental doses of food allergen to food-allergic patients, to induce a state of desensitization. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy all remain ongoing concerns. Clinical trials for oral immunotherapy have encompassed many variations, including differences in dosage sizes and frequency, duration of build-up, type of allergen used, patient characteristics, and adjuvant therapies. Consequently, studies have also shown variation in rates of adverse effects, and successful desensitization. Here, we provide an overview of the key studies and discuss the implications of this heterogeneity. While desensitization is successful in the majority of patients, only a minority appear to develop sustained unresponsiveness even after years of therapy. Much larger and longitudinal studies using more homogenous protocols are needed in order to evaluate the clinical applicability of OIT, its long-term effectiveness, and effect on quality of life. The role of adjunctive therapies, including omalizumab and probiotics, requires further evaluation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of Internet-delivered psychotherapies suggest that clients report development of a therapeutic alliance in the Internet environment. Because a majority of the interventions studied to date have been therapist-assisted to some degree, it remains unclear whether a therapeutic alliance can develop within the context of an Internet-delivered self-guided intervention with no therapist support, and whether this has consequences for program outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study reports findings of a secondary analysis of data from 90 participants with mild-to-moderate depression, anxiety, and/or stress who used a fully automated mobile phone and Web-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention called \"myCompass\" in a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Symptoms, functioning, and positive well-being were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Therapeutic alliance was measured at post-intervention using the Agnew Relationship Measure (ARM), and this was supplemented with qualitative data obtained from 16 participant interviews. Extent of participant engagement with the program was also assessed. RESULTS: Mean ratings on the ARM subscales were above the neutral midpoints, and the interviewees provided rich detail of a meaningful and collaborative therapeutic relationship with the myCompass program. Whereas scores on the ARM subscales did not correlate with treatment outcomes, participants' ratings of the quality of their emotional connection with the program correlated significantly and positively with program logins, frequency of self-monitoring, and number of treatment modules completed (r values between .32-.38, P</=.002). The alliance (ARM) subscales measuring perceived empowerment (r=.26, P=.02) and perceived freedom to self-disclose (r=.25, P=.04) also correlated significantly in a positive direction with self-monitoring frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative and qualitative findings from this analysis showed that a positive therapeutic alliance can develop in the Internet environment in the absence of therapist support, and that components of the alliance may have implications for program usage. Further investigation of alliance features in the Internet environment and the consequences of these for treatment outcomes and user engagement is warranted.

In this study, host tissue response and biomechanical properties of mesh fabricated from co-electrospun poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) and fibrinogen (Fg) were compared with those of polypropylene mesh (PPM) in a canine abdominal defect model. Macroscopic, microscopic, histological, and biomechanical evaluations were performed over a 24-week period. The results showed that PLCL/Fg mesh had similar host tissue responses but better initial vascularization and graft site tissue organization than PPM. The efficacy of the PLCL/Fg mesh was further examined in human pelvic floor reconstruction. Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and pelvic organ prolapse quantification during 6-month follow-up were compared for patients receiving PLCL/Fg mesh versus PPM. According to the pelvic organ prolapse quantification scores, the anterior vaginal wall 3 cm proximal to the hymen point (Aa point), most distal edge of the cervix or vaginal cuff scar point (C point), and posterior fornix point (D point) showed significant improvement (P<0.01) at 1, 3, and 6 months for both groups compared with preoperatively. At 6 months, improvements at the Aa point in the PLCL/Fg group were significantly more (P<0.005) than the PPM group, indicating that, while both materials improve the patient symptoms, PLCL/Fg mesh resulted in more obvious improvement.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Progress in genetics and breeding in pea still suffers from the limited availability of molecular resources. SNP markers that can be identified through affordable sequencing processes, without the need for prior genome reduction or a reference genome to assemble sequencing data would allow the discovery and genetic mapping of thousands of molecular markers. Such an approach could significantly speed up genetic studies and marker assisted breeding for non-model species. RESULTS: A total of 419,024 SNPs were discovered using HiSeq whole genome sequencing of four pea lines, followed by direct identification of SNP markers without assembly using the discoSnp tool. Subsequent filtering led to the identification of 131,850 highly designable SNPs, polymorphic between at least two of the four pea lines. A subset of 64,754 SNPs was called and genotyped by short read sequencing on a subpopulation of 48 RILs from the cross 'Baccara' x 'PI180693'. This data was used to construct a WGGBS-derived pea genetic map comprising 64,263 markers. This map is collinear with previous pea consensus maps and therefore with the Medicago truncatula genome. Sequencing of four additional pea lines showed that 33 % to 64 % of the mapped SNPs, depending on the pairs of lines considered, are polymorphic and can therefore be useful in other crosses. The subsequent genotyping of a subset of 1000 SNPs, chosen for their mapping positions using a KASP assay, showed that almost all generated SNPs are highly designable and that most (95 %) deliver highly qualitative genotyping results. Using rather low sequencing coverages in SNP discovery and in SNP inferring did not hinder the identification of hundreds of thousands of high quality SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: The development and optimization of appropriate tools in SNP discovery and genetic mapping have allowed us to make available a massive new genomic resource in pea. It will be useful for both fine mapping within chosen QTL confidence intervals and marker assisted breeding for important traits in pea improvement.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patterns of physical activity (PA) and sedentary time, including volume of bouted activity, are important health indicators. However, the effect of accelerometer epoch length on measurement of these patterns and associations with health outcomes in children remain unknown. METHOD: We measured activity patterns in 308 children (52% girls, age range = 8-11 years) using ActiGraph GT1M accelerometers with 15-s epochs and reintegrated to 60-s epochs. We calculated the volume (minutes per day) of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), sedentary time, light, moderate, and vigorous PA, as well as bouted MVPA and sedentary time (0-5 min, 5-10 min, 10-20 min, and > 20 min). RESULTS: The difference between 15-s and 60-s epochs was statistically significant for all outcomes; however, effect sizes were small or negligible in 30% of comparisons. Bias ranged from 1.9 min/day (total MVPA) to 102.7 min/day (0-5 min sedentary bouts). Regression-based estimates of bias and 95% limits of agreement illustrated that the magnitude, and in some cases, the direction, of between-epoch differences varied with activity level. Correlations with body mass index and cardiovascular fitness were similar for 15-s (r = -.19 to .20) and 60-s (r = -.16 to .29) epochs. Estimated 15-s data (predicted from 60-s) were similar to measured data and had similar relationships with health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Epoch length influences measurement of PA and sedentary patterns and the effect is modified by activity level. However, associations with health outcomes were similar and epoch differences can be adjusted. Future research should clarify the accuracy of different epoch lengths for measuring bouted activity and evaluate whether epoch length alters relationships with additional health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) often show detrimental deficits in higher order cognitive functions requiring coordination of multiple brain networks. Although assessing TBI-related deficits in higher order cognition in the context of network dysfunction is promising, few studies have systematically investigated altered interactions among multiple networks in chronic TBI. METHOD: We characterized disrupted resting-state functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and frontoparietal control network (FPCN) whose interactions are required for internally and externally focused goal-directed cognition in chronic TBI. Specifically, we compared the network interactions of 40 chronic TBI individuals (8 years post-injury on average) with those of 17 healthy individuals matched for gender, age, and years of education. RESULTS: The network-based statistic (NBS) on DMN-DAN-FPCN connectivity of these groups revealed statistically significant (p NBS2.58) reductions in within-DMN, within-FPCN, DMN-DAN, and DMN-FPCN connectivity of the TBI group over healthy controls. Importantly, such disruptions occurred prominently in between-network connectivity. Subsequent analyses further exhibited the disrupted connectivity patterns of the chronic TBI group occurring preferentially in long-range and inter-hemispheric connectivity of DMN-DAN-FPCN. Most importantly, graph-theoretic analysis demonstrated relative reductions in global, local and cost efficiency (p<.05) as a consequence of the network disruption patterns in the TBI group. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that assessing multiple networks-of-interest simultaneously will allow us to better understand deficits in goal-directed cognition and other higher order cognitive phenomena in chronic TBI. Future research will be needed to better understand the behavioral consequences related to these network disruptions.",

The resulting CuS/PCCNS nanocomposites exhibit good biocompatibility, strong stability, and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of  approximately 45.7%. The subsequent loading of anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) creates a superior theranostic agent with pH- and heat-responsive drug release, leading to almost complete destruction of mouse cervical tumor under NIR laser irradiation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were 66-, 69-, and 32-year-old women with complaints of recurrent flank pain and urinary tract infection due to an obstructed nonfunctioning kidney. Materials used were standard laparoscopic instruments and a 30 degrees  10-mm high-definition laparoscope. Under general anesthesia, each patient was placed in a lithotomy position with the affected side up at 45 degrees . A Veress needle was initially inserted through the umbilicus and was later replaced with a 10-mm laparoscopic port, with an additional 5-mm port also inserted at the affected lower quadrant site. The patient was then positioned in a steep Trendelenburg position, and a 10-mm port was inserted through the posterior vaginal wall under direct vision from the abdominal cavity that was later used for the laparoscope. Nephrectomy proceeded despite noted severe adhesions, and the kidney was placed in the specimen retrieval bag. The vaginal port site was enlarged to 3 cm for extraction of the specimen. A Penrose drain was placed at the lower quadrant 5-mm trocar site. The vaginal wound was repaired using running 2-0 absorbable sutures. RESULTS: Three cases of transvaginal hybrid NOTES nephrectomy were successfully completed with a median operative time of 310 minutes and mean estimated blood loss of 300 mL. Median renal dimensions were as follows: craniocaudal, 10.2 (range, 10.6-9) cm; laterolateral, 6.5 (range, 7-5.3) cm; and anteroposterior, 4.8 (range, 6.5-3.9) cm. The patients resumed regular diet as early as Day 1 postoperatively. The drain was removed prior to discharge. The mean date of discharge was Day 3 postoperatively. There were no noted surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid NOTES transvaginal nephrectomy is a feasible and reproducible procedure in selected patients regardless of laterality for better cosmesis, reduced postoperative pain, and early recovery.",

BACKGROUND: Horizontal violence, also called workplace bullying or lateral violence, is a long-standing nursing issue. METHOD: Content analysis was used to analyse open-format textual responses from 126 registered nurses. RESULTS: A powerful collective story emerged from nurses' shared experiences with HV, describing the characters and the setting in which HV and its consequences exist. Nurses' depictions of HV were consistent despite the different organisational structures of their workplaces suggesting that hospital type is not the explanation for HV, rather the culture of acute care nursing. Nurses want change and asked for tactics to resolve HV within their institutions; some provided specific solutions. CONCLUSION: Nurse managers must continue to address HV by using a variety of known tactics, as well as adopting new evidence-based interventions as they are identified. The anti-bullying message should be disseminated through professional nursing organisations as well as in local health-care establishments. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers need to be the culture champions who hold individuals accountable for HV and foster professionalism through their leadership.",

Research on the topic of cyberbullying is growing exponentially, but not all studies use the same definition to examine this concept. A concept analysis in the style of Walker and Avant was used to analyze cyberbullying. Literature was retrieved from the databases of CINAHL and PubMed between the years 2009 and October 2014 using the key word \"cyberbullying.\" Twenty-five English-language articles were located that delineated a definition of cyberbullying. First, articles were analyzed to discover the defining attributes of cyberbullying. Second, antecedents, consequences, and related terms of cyberbullying were examined. Third, an operational definition of cyberbullying is proposed on the basis of a consensus of the review. This review proposes that the defining attributes of cyberbullying are: (1) electronic form of contact (2) an aggressive act (3) intent (4) repetition (publicity), and (5) harm of the victim. The antecedents most often mentioned were lower self-esteem, higher levels of depression, and social isolation and the consequences were academic problems and affective disorders. A single concise definition of cyberbullying was created that can be utilized by health care providers to educate their patients and families about cyberbullying. This definition also can be used to guide research to develop effective interventions.",

        "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is known to be a central cellular nutrient sensor and master regulator of protein metabolism; therefore, it is indispensable for normal embryonic development. We showed previously in a diabetic pregnancy that embryonic mTORC1 phosphorylation is increased in case of maternal hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia. Further, the preimplantation embryo is exposed to increased L-leucine levels during a diabetic pregnancy. To understand how mTOR signalling is regulated in preimplantation embryos, we examined consequences of L-leucine and glucose stimulation on mTORC1 signalling and downstream targets in in vitro cultured preimplantation rabbit blastocysts and in vivo. High levels of L-leucine and glucose lead to higher phosphorylation of mTORC1 and its downstream target ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in these embryos. Further, L-leucine supplementation resulted in higher embryonic expression of genes involved in cell cycle (cyclin D1; CCND1), translation initiation (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; EIF4E), amino acid transport (large neutral amino acid transporter 2; Lat2: gene SLC7A8) and proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PCNA) in a mTORC1-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of S6K1 and expression patterns of CCND1 and EIF4E were increased in embryos from diabetic rabbits, while the expression of proliferation marker PCNA was decreased. In these embryos, protein synthesis was increased and autophagic activity was decreased. We conclude that mammalian preimplantation embryos sense changes in nutrient supply via mTORC1 signalling. Therefore, mTORC1 may be a decisive mediator of metabolic programming in a diabetic pregnancy.",

Cognitive function was measured using the mini-mental state examination-Korean version (MMSE-K). Participation in social activities was classified as \"consistent participation,\" \"consistent non-participation,\" \"participation to non-participation,\" and \"non-participation to participation.\" Linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between type of social activity (religious organizations, friendship organizations, leisure/culture/sports clubs, family or school reunion, volunteering work, and political organizations), and cognitive function. RESULTS: Individuals who reported \"no participation to participation\" (b = 0.778, p < 0.0001) and \"consistent participation\" (b = 0.968, p < 0.0001) were more likely to show reduced cognitive decline than those who reported \"consistent non-participation\" (p < 0.0001 for trend). The positive association between cognitive function and consistent participation in religious activities, friendship organizations, and family/school reunions was particularly strong (b = 0.325, p < 0.0001; b = 0.570, p < 0.0001; b = 0.234, p = 0.0004; respectively, versus consistent non-participation). CONCLUSIONS: Promotion of participation in religious organizations, friendship organizations, and family/school reunions (only for older persons) may help preserve cognitive function in individuals aged 45 years or older in Korea.

        "abstract": "Aside from their use in the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, benzodiazepines and other GABAA receptor positive modulators are widely used as add-on treatments in schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic psychoses. However, there is relatively little direct clinical or pre-clinical evidence for antipsychotic effects of GABAergic medications. Previous studies have indicated that zolpidem, a GABAergic drug acting preferentially at alpha1-containing GABAA receptors, may produce catalepsy through interactions with dopaminergic neurotransmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate effects of zolpidem in experimental models of antipsychotic activity and extrapyramidal side effects in Wistar rats. Effects of zolpidem were compared with that of a classic benzodiazepine drug, diazepam and a second-generation antipsychotic medication, risperidone. High doses of risperidone (10.0mg/kg, i.p.) and zolpidem (10.0mg/kg, i.p.), but not diazepam, induced relatively short-lasting cataleptic responses in the bar test. Zolpidem and risperidone, but not diazepam, produced some antipsychotic-like effects at doses, which produced no catalepsy and did not inhibit spontaneous locomotor activity and apomorphine-induced stereotypies. The present results tend to indicate that zolpidem exerts some neuroleptic-like effects at doses, which do not produce motor side effects. Our findings may provide further rationale for the development of new subtype-selective GABAA receptor modulators for the treatment of psychotic symptoms.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Renal biopsy is crucial for management of lupus nephritis. However, it is invasive and can cause bleeding and infection. In our previous study, we developed a semiquantitative method for gallium renal imaging and demonstrated a good correlation between the left kidney-to-spine ratio (K/S ratio) and the results of renal biopsy. However, the accuracy of left K/S ratio is compromised by the variation of spinal gallium uptake, especially in patients with extraordinarily high or low gallium uptakes in the spine. In this study, we developed an absolute quantitative method and compared the results of quantitative gallium images, semiquantitative gallium images, visual methods, and renal biopsies. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with lupus nephritis were enrolled and underwent renal biopsy to determine activity index (AI) and chronicity index. A delayed 48-hour gallium scan was also performed and interpreted by visual, semiquantitative, and absolute quantitative methods. For absolute quantitative analysis, a standard solution with activities of approximately 555 KBq (15 muCi) was prepared and poured into a 5-mL tube, which was placed close to the patient. ROIs were drawn around the outer edge of the left kidney as well as around the outer edges of the standard. A kidney uptake index (KUI) was calculated, and the results were compared with K/S ratio, visual grading, and renal biopsies. RESULTS: Kidney uptake index had the best correlation with AI among the 3 methods using Spearman rank correlation test. The Spearman R values were 0.78, 0.71, and 0.61 for KUI, K/S ratio and visual grading, respectively. Chronicity index did not correlate well with the results of any of the 3 methods. In addition, AI was significantly higher in patients with a KUI equal to or greater than 1.5, when compared with patients with a KUI lower than 1.5 (P = 0.00001 by Mann-Whitney U test). Using a K/S ratio of 0.95 as a cutoff value, AI also showed a statistically significant difference with P = 0.0001. When a visual grading of 2 was used as a cutoff value, P = 0.0008. The difference in AI was most significant when the statistical value was based on the KUI. CONCLUSIONS: The KUI showed better correlation with the results of renal biopsy than the K/S ratio and the visual grading. We suggest that the KUI from the absolute quantitative renal gallium scintigraphy may be a useful parameter for evaluating the disease activity in lupus nephritis.",

        "abstract": "In resource-limited areas, such as sub-Saharan Africa, problems in accurate cancer case ascertainment and enumeration of the at-risk population make it difficult to estimate cancer incidence. We took advantage of a large well-enumerated healthcare system to estimate the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a cancer which has become prominent in the HIV era and whose incidence may be changing with the rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART). To achieve this, we evaluated HIV-infected adults receiving care between 2007 and 2012 at any of three medical centers in Kenya and Uganda that participate in the East Africa International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) Consortium. Through IeDEA, clinicians received training in KS recognition and biopsy equipment. We found that the overall prevalence of KS among 102,945 HIV-infected adults upon clinic enrollment was 1.4%; it declined over time at the largest site. Among 140,552 patients followed for 319,632 person-years, the age-standardized incidence rate was 334/100,000 person-years (95% CI: 314-354/100,000 person-years). Incidence decreased over time and was lower in women, persons on ART, and those with higher CD4 counts. The incidence rate among patients on ART with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm(3) was 32/100,000 person-years (95% CI: 14-70/100,000 person-years). Despite reductions over time coincident with the expansion of ART, KS incidence among HIV-infected adults in East Africa equals or exceeds the most common cancers in resource-replete settings. In resource-limited settings, strategic efforts to improve cancer diagnosis in combination with already well-enumerated at-risk denominators can make healthcare systems attractive platforms for estimating cancer incidence.",

Subretinal bleed, exudation, and macular edema resulted in progressive deterioration of visual acuity. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used to serially monitor the lesion. After ruling out systemic lesions of VHL disease, the patient was subjected to direct laser photocoagulation of the lesion which resulted in further loss in vision with increase in bleed and exudation. Subsequently, the patient was given 2 monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab followed by laser photocoagulation of feeder arteriole. This combination therapy resulted in resolution of exudation, bleed, and macular edema with improvement in visual acuity. Thus, vision-threatening RCH may be safely and effectively treated by means of a combination therapy comprising of intravitreal bevacizumab and feeder vessel treatment.",

The maximum achievable surface coverage on a hydrophobic surface occurs around the protein isoelectric point and adsorption is reduced when either increasing or decreasing pH, indicating that electrostatic protein-protein interactions in the adsorbed layer play an important role. Using Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, where proteins are coarse grained to the amino acid level, we estimate the protein isoelectric point in the vicinity of charged surfaces as well as the lateral osmotic pressure in the adsorbed monolayer. Good agreement with available experimental data is achieved and we further make predictions of the protein orientation at hydrophobic and charged surfaces. Finally, we present a perturbation theory for predicting shifts in the protein isoelectric point due to close proximity to charged surfaces. Although this approximate model requires only single protein properties (mean charge and its variance), excellent agreement is found with MC simulations.",

We herein examined metabolite contents in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin using a metabolomic analysis. Fifty-four compounds were detected, and the contents of metabolites from the citric acid cycle increased in response to the insulin treatment for 4 h, which was sensitive to U0126 and LY294002, inhibitors for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, respectively. The cellular contents of fumaric acid and malic acid were increased more by insulin than those of citric acid and succinic acid. Time-course changes in metabolites from the citric acid cycle exhibited oscillations with a 2-h cycle. A metabolic pathway analysis also indicated that insulin affected the metabolism of alanine, aspartate and glutamate, as well as that of arginine and proline. The contents of free amino acids were slightly decreased by the insulin treatment, while the co-treatment with U0126 and LY294002 abrogated these insulin-mediated decreases. The present study revealed the unexpected accumulation of citric acid cycle metabolites in adipocytes by insulin. Our results indicate the usefulness of metabolomic analyses for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation of metabolic pathways in cell-culture systems.",

        "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic metal that affects the central nervous system. Recently we have demonstrated that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin rescues neuronal cells from Cd-poisoning. Here we show that rapamycin inhibited Cd-induced mitochondrial ROS-dependent neuronal apoptosis. Intriguingly, rapamycin remarkably blocked phosphorylation of JNK, Erk1/2 and p38 in neuronal cells induced by Cd, which was strengthened by co-treatment with Mito-TEMPO. Inhibition of JNK and Erk1/2 by SP600125 and U0126, respectively, potentiated rapamycin's prevention from Cd-induced apoptosis. Consistently, over-expression of dominant negative c-Jun or MKK1 also potently improved the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on Cd neurotoxicity. Furthermore, pretreatment with SP600125 or U0126, or expression of dominant negative c-Jun or MKK1 enhanced the inhibitory effects of rapamycin or Mito-TEMPO on Cd-induced ROS. Further investigation found that co-treatment with Mito-TEMPO/rapamycin more effectively rescued cells by preventing Cd inactivation of PP2A than treatment with rapamycin or Mito-TEMPO alone. Over-expression of wild-type PP2A reinforced rapamycin or Mito-TEMPO suppression of activated JNK and Erk1/2 pathways, as well as ROS production and apoptosis in neuronal cells in response to Cd. The findings indicate that rapamycin ameliorates Cd-evoked neuronal apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial ROS inactivation of PP2A, thereby suppressing activation of JNK and Erk1/2 pathways. Our results underline that rapamycin may have a potential in preventing Cd-induced oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of the tumor shadow disappearance rate (TDR) on integrated PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) with low glucose uptake. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2008 to September 2010, 99 patients who underwent fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET (F-FDG-PET)/CT scanning for the evaluation of SPNs with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) below 2.75 (2.5+10%) were retrospectively reviewed. Among the 99 SPNs from these patients, 67 were malignant and 32 were benign, based on surgical pathology. Differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups were examined by means of the independent t-test, the Mann-Whitney U-test, and the chi-test. To test the efficacy of TDR for determining malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-, respectively) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the pathological test as the gold standard. RESULTS: Patients with malignant nodules were older than those with benign nodules (64.5 vs. 55.1 years, respectively, P<0.001) and had higher TDRs (0.8 vs. 0.3, respectively, P<0.001). The optimal cutoff point for the TDR was 0.4886 where the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.851, 0.844, 0.919, and 0.730, respectively, and the LR+ and LR- were 5.443 and 0177, respectively. A significant negative correlation between TDR and SUVmax was found only in the malignant group. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of TDR complements the PET/CT evaluation of SPNs with a low F-FDG uptake.",

        "abstract": "STUDY HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that fertility disorders in patients with aberrant expression of Cysteine-RIch Secretory Protein 2 (CRISP2) could be linked to the proposed functional role of this protein in fertilization. STUDY FINDING: Our in vivo and in vitro observations reveal that Crisp2-knockout mice exhibit significant defects in fertility-associated parameters under demanding conditions, as well as deficiencies in sperm fertilizing ability, hyperactivation development and intracellular Ca(2+) regulation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Testicular CRISP2 is present in mature sperm and has been proposed to participate in gamete fusion in both humans and rodents. Interestingly, evidence in humans shows that aberrant expression of CRISP2 is associated with male infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: A mouse line carrying a deletion in the sixth exon of the Crisp2 gene was generated. The analyses of the reproductive phenotype of Crisp2(-/-) adult males included the evaluation of their fertility before and after being subjected to unilateral vasectomy, in vivo fertilization rates obtained after mating with either estrus or superovulated females, in vitro sperm fertilizing ability and different sperm functional parameters associated with capacitation such as tyrosine phosphorylation (by western blot), acrosome reaction (by Coomassie Blue staining), hyperactivation (by computer-assisted sperm analysis) and intracellular Ca(2+) levels (by flow cytometry). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Crisp2(-/-) males presented normal fertility and in vivo fertilization rates when mated with estrus females. However, the mutant mice showed clear defects in those reproductive parameters compared with controls under more demanding conditions, i.e. when subjected to unilateral vasectomy to reduce the number of ejaculated sperm (n = 5; P< 0.05), or when mated with hormone-treated females containing a high number of eggs in the ampulla (n >/= 5; P< 0.01). In vitro fertilization studies revealed that Crisp2(-/-) sperm exhibited deficiencies to penetrate the egg vestments (i.e. cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida) and to fuse with the egg (n >/= 6; P< 0.01). Consistent with this, Crisp2-null sperm showed lower levels of hyperactivation (n = 7; P< 0.05), a vigorous motility required for penetration of the egg coats, as well as a dysregulation in intracellular Ca(2+) levels associated with capacitation (n = 5; P< 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The analysis of the possible mechanisms involved in fertility disorders in men with abnormal expression of CRISP2 was carried out in Crisp2 knockout mice due to the ethical and technical problems inherent to the use of human gametes for fertilization studies. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings in mice showing that Crisp2(-/-) males exhibit fertility and fertilization defects under demanding conditions support fertilization defects in sperm as a mechanism underlying infertility in men with aberrant expression of CRISP2. Moreover, our observations in mice resemble the situation in humans where fertility disorders can or cannot be detected depending on the accumulation of own individual defects or the fertility status of the partner. Finally, the fact that reproductive defects in mice are masked by conventional mating highlights the need of using different experimental approaches to analyze male fertility.

        "abstract": "The opportunity for substantial efficiency enhancements of thin film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar photovoltaic (PV) cells using plasmonic absorbers requires ultra-thin transparent conducting oxide top electrodes with low resistivity and high transmittances in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Fabricating ultra-thin indium tin oxide (ITO) films (sub-50 nm) using conventional methods has presented a number of challenges; however, a novel method involving chemical shaving of thicker (greater than 80 nm) RF sputter deposited high-quality ITO films has been demonstrated. This study investigates the effect of oxygen concentration on the etch rates of RF sputter deposited ITO films to provide a detailed understanding of the interaction of all critical experimental parameters to help create even thinner layers to allow for more finely tune plasmonic resonances. ITO films were deposited on silicon substrates with a 98-nm, thermally grown oxide using RF magnetron sputtering with oxygen concentrations of 0, 0.4 and 1.0 sccm and annealed at 300  degrees C air ambient. Then the films were etched using a combination of water and hydrochloric and nitric acids for 1, 3, 5 and 8 min at room temperature. In-between each etching process cycle, the films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, 4-point probe (electrical conductivity), and variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. All the films were polycrystalline in nature and highly oriented along the (222) reflection. Ultra-thin ITO films with record low resistivity values (as low as 5.83 x 10(-4) Omega.cm) were obtained and high optical transparency is exhibited in the 300-1000 nm wavelength region for all the ITO films. The etch rate, preferred crystal lattice growth plane, d-spacing and lattice distortion were also observed to be highly dependent on the nature of growth environment for RF sputter deposited ITO films. The structural, electrical, and optical properties of the ITO films are discussed with respect to the oxygen ambient nature and etching time in detail to provide guidance for plasmonic enhanced a-Si:H solar PV cell fabrication.",

        "abstract": "While the number of studies of the non-medical use of prescription drugs to augment cognitive functions is growing steadily, psychological factors that can potentially help explain variance in such pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement (CE) behavior are often neglected in research. This study investigates the association between the Big Five personality traits and a retrospective (prior CE-drug use) as well as a prospective (willingness to use CE drugs) measure of taking prescription drugs with the purpose of augmenting one's cognitive functions (e.g., concentration, memory, or vigilance) without medical necessity. We use data from a large representative survey of German employees (N = 6454, response rate = 29.8%). The Five Factor Model (FFM) of Personality was measured with a short version of the Big Five Personality Traits Inventory (BFI-S), which includes: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Together with this, demographic variables such as gender, age, education, and income were used as potential confounders in multiple logistic regression models. Our results show a 2.96% lifetime prevalence of CE-drug use and a 10.45% willingness to (re)use such drugs in the future. We found that less conscientious and more neurotic respondents have a higher probability of prior CE-drug use and a greater willingness to use CE drugs in the future. No significant effects were found for openness, extraversion, or agreeableness. Prior CE-drug use was strongly associated with a greater willingness to take such drugs in the future. This study shows that specific personality traits are not only associated with prior enhancement behavior, but also affect the willingness to (re)use such drugs. It helps increase understanding of the risk factors of CE-drug use, which is a health-related behavior that can entail severe side-effects for consumers. The knowledge gathered can thus help improve interventions aimed at minimizing health problems.",

        "abstract": "Mechanical factors among many physiochemical properties of scaffolds for stem cell-based tissue engineering significantly affect tissue morphogenesis by controlling stem cell behaviors including proliferation and phenotype-specific differentiation. Core-shell electrospinning provides a unique opportunity to control mechanical properties of scaffolds independent of surface chemistry, rendering a greater freedom to tailor design for specific applications. In this study, we synthesized electrospun core-shell scaffolds having different core composition and/or core-to-shell dimensional ratios. Two independent biocompatible polymer systems, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) and gelatin as the core materials while maintaining the shell polymer with polycaprolactone (PCL), were utilized. The mechanics of such scaffolds was analyzed at the microscale and macroscales to determine the potential implications it may hold for cell-material and tissue-material interactions. The mechanical properties of individual core-shell fibers were controlled by core-shell composition and structure. The individual fiber modulus correlated with the increase in percent core size ranging from 0.55+/-0.10GPa to 1.74+/-0.22GPa and 0.48+/-0.12GPa to 1.53+/-0.12GPa for the PEKK-PCL and gelatin-PCL fibers, respectively. More importantly, it was demonstrated that mechanical properties of the scaffolds at the macroscale were dominantly determined by porosity under compression. The increase of scaffold porosity from 70.2%+/-1.0% to 93.2%+/-0.5% by increasing the core size in the PEKK-PCL scaffold resulted in the decrease of the compressive elastic modulus from 227.67+/-20.39kPa to 14.55+/-1.43kPa while a greater changes in the porosity of gelatin-PCL scaffold from 54.5%+/-4.2% to 89.6%+/-0.4% resulted in the compressive elastic modulus change from 484.01+/-30.18kPa to 17.57+/-1.40kPa. On the other hand, the biphasic behaviors under tensile mechanical loading result in a range from a minimum of 5.42+/-1.05MPa to a maximum of 12.00+/-1.96MPa for the PEKK-PCL scaffolds, and 10.19+/-4.49MPa to 22.60+/-2.44MPa for the gelatin-PCL scaffolds. These results suggest a feasible approach for precisely controlling the local and global mechanical characteristics, in addition to independent control over surface chemistry, to achieve a desired tissue morphogenesis using the core-shell electrospinning.",

This study evaluates the prevalence of HPV infection in Hetian Prefecture, Xinjiang, and establishes risk factors associated with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) genotypes in this region. In this cross-sectional, population-based study, 883 healthy women 15-54 years of age were enrolled. All participants completed a questionnaire regarding sociocultural and sexual activity characteristics. Visual inspections with acetic acid, colposcopies and biopsies were performed using the Preventive Oncology International microbiopsy protocol for pathological diagnosis. Cervical epithelial tissue specimens were collected and tested for HPV using linear array assays. According to the results of HR-HPV infection status, individuals infected with HR-HPV were classified into one group, and the remaining individuals were classified into the control group. The risk factors for HR-HPF infection were analyzed. The participants included 66 women (7.47%) with HR-HPV, 10 women (1.13%) with low-risk HPV, and 14 women (1.59%) with HPV of unknown risk. The five most prevalent types of HR-HPV were HPV-16 (0.31%), HPV-51 (0.08%), HPV-31 (0.07%), HPV-58 (0.07%), and HPV-39 (0.06%). Vulvovaginal ulcers and vulvovaginal inflammation were found in 190 participants (21.52%) and 256 participants (28.99%), respectively. The HR-HPV and control groups significantly differed with respect to age at first marriage, number of marriages, and the presence of vulvovaginal ulcers and vulvovaginal inflammation (p<0.05). Based on this study, an immunization strategy targeting HPV-16 should be prioritized in Hetian Prefecture. These findings contribute to the understanding of HPV infection.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The ability of vascular genes to provide treatment predictive information in breast cancer patients remains unclear. As such, we assessed the expression of genes representative of normal endothelial microvasculature (MV) in relation to treatment-specific patient subgroups. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used expression data from 993 breast tumors to assess 57 MV genes (summarized to yield an MV score) as well as the genomic grade index (GGI) and PAM50 signatures. MV score was compared with CD31 staining by correlation and gene ontology (GO) analysis, along with clinicopathologic characteristics and PAM50 subtypes. Uni-, multivariate, and/or t-test analyses were performed in all and treatment-specific subgroups, along with a clinical trial cohort of patients with metastatic breast cancer, seven of whom received antiangiogenic therapy. RESULTS: MV score did not correlate with microvessel density (correlation = 0.096), but displayed enrichment for angiogenic GO terms, and was lower in Luminal B tumors. In endocrine-treated patients, a high MV score was associated with decreased risk of metastasis [HR 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.38-0.89], even after adjusting for histologic grade, but not GGI or PAM50. Subgroup analysis showed the prognostic strength of the MV score resided in low genomic grade tumors and MV score was significantly increased in metastatic breast tumors after treatment with sunitinib + docetaxel (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: MV score identifies two groups of better and worse survival in low-risk endocrine-treated breast cancer patients. We also show normalization of tumor vasculature on a transcriptional level in response to an angiogenic inhibitor in human breast cancer samples. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2417-26. (c)2016 AACR.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to ascertain the clinical outcome and overall survival of holoprosencephaly (HPE) patients diagnosed antenatally and postnatally, to determine the accuracy of antenatal diagnosis and to determine the role of neurosurgical intervention in HPE. DESIGN: This is a retrospective review over a 10-year period. PATIENTS: Sixty-three patients were included in the study, 45 were diagnosed by antenatal radiological imaging and 18 were diagnosed by postnatal radiological imaging. Patient data was drawn from Temple Street Children's University Hospital (the national paediatric neurosurgery centre), the National Maternity Hospital in Holle's Street, Dublin, and Our Lady of Sick Children Hospital, Dublin. METHODS: The study was carried out through a review of antenatal and postnatal radiological imaging and reports, clinical charts, GP letters from patient follow-up and telephone conversations with parents of HPE patients. RESULTS: Four patients in the antenatal diagnosis group had follow-up foetal MRI confirming HPE. Twelve in this group had radiological follow-up postnatally, and in five of these, HPE was confirmed. The remaining seven were identified as false positive. Alobar HPE constituted 55 % (21/38) of patients with 95 % mortality. Fifty-one percent had a normal karyotype. The overall survival in the antenatal diagnosis group was 13 %. In the postnatal group, 18 patients were identified, 67 % (12/18) lobar and 33 % (6/18) semilobar. Normal karyotype was found in 72 % (13/18), with an overall survival rate of 56 % (10/18). Neurosurgical intervention in both groups mainly consisted of CSF diversion in the form of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or cystoperitoneal shunt (CP) (13/67). CONCLUSION: Foetal MRI should be routinely performed in suspected cases of HPE, and reliance on ultrasound alone in the antenatal period may not be sufficient. In our study, there is a high early mortality noted in severe cases of HPE, while milder forms of HPE in children tend to survive beyond infancy albeit with associated complications that required neurosurgical intervention and medical management for other associated systemic anomalies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach to establish a landslide displacement forecasting model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with random hidden weights. To quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions, a framework for probabilistic forecasting of landslide displacement is developed. The aim of this paper is to construct prediction intervals (PIs) instead of deterministic forecasting. A lower-upper bound estimation (LUBE) method is adopted to construct ANN-based PIs, while a new single hidden layer feedforward ANN with random hidden weights for LUBE is proposed. Unlike the original implementation of LUBE, the input weights and hidden biases of the ANN are randomly chosen, and only the output weights need to be adjusted. Combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA), a hybrid evolutionary algorithm, PSOGSA, is utilized to optimize the output weights. Furthermore, a new ANN objective function, which combines a modified combinational coverage width-based criterion with one-norm regularization, is proposed. Two benchmark data sets and two real-world landslide data sets are presented to illustrate the capability and merit of our method. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can construct high-quality PIs.",

There is a lack of evidence on managerial aspects of the MNCH program management and implementation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study used qualitative methods to explore the challenges national, provincial and district program managers have faced in implementing a community midwifery program in province of Punjab while also exploring future directions for the program under a devolved health system. While the program had been designed in earnest, the planning lacked critical elements of involving relevant stakeholders in design and implementation, socio-demographic context and capacity of the existing health system. Financial limitations, weak leadership and lack of a political commitment to the problem of maternal health have also had an impact on program implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that there is a need to re-structure the program while ensuring sustainability and collaboration within the health sector to increase uptake of skilled birth attendance and improve maternal health care in Pakistan.",

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the epidemiology of leprosy in Juazeiro-BA, from 2002 to 2012. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted based in data of the Diseases Notification System, assigned by the service of Epidemiology from Juazeiro-BA, between 2002 and 2012. RESULTS: 1,916 new cases of leprosy were detected between 2002 and 2012, of which 921 (48.07%) represented male sex, 995 (51.93%) female, and there was a reduction in the incidence rate of leprosy per 100,000 inhabitants. Most carriers were brown individuals, with low levels of education, living in the urban area, being more prevalent in the economically active age group. Through statistical analysis we found that there are more chances of developing sequelae among men, and multibacillary individuals older than 45 years. CONCLUSIONS: The work serves to direct efforts to control this disease, and highlights the importance of active search for new cases to achieve an early diagnosis, reducing the number of sequels and allowing breaking the chain of disease transmission.",

First, we examined taurocholate adsorption in vitro by various types of sodium alginate (Na-Alg). High molecular-weight, guluronic acid-rich Na-Alg showed the greatest adsorption of taurocholate, and therefore the corresponding Ca-Alg was chosen for the in vivo study. Rats were fed a high-cholesterol diet or a Ca-Alg-containing diet for 2 weeks. Body weight and diet intake were measured, and the general condition of the animals was monitored during this period. After 14 d, the plasma concentration of cholesterol, portal plasma concentration of bile acid, and bile acid in feces were measured. The plasma concentration of cholesterol was significantly reduced in rats fed a 2% Ca-Alg-containing diet. Furthermore, the portal concentration of bile acid was significantly lowered in the 2% Ca-Alg group. A tendency for a Ca-Alg concentration-dependent increase in fecal excretion of bile acid was also seen, although it was not statistically significant. While several changes in biochemical parameters and histopathological findings were observed, all the values remained within the physiological range. These results indicate that Ca-Alg is effective in reducing plasma cholesterol. A possible mechanism would be enhanced fecal excretion of bile acid due to reduced intestinal reabsorption, which in turn might stimulate bile acid synthesis from cholesterol in the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma cholesterol.",

        "abstract": "Camponotus rufipes workers are characterized by an age-related polyethism. In the initial weeks of adult life, young workers perform tasks inside the nest before they switch to multimodal foraging tasks outside. We tested the hypothesis that this transition is accompanied by profound adaptations in the peripheral and central visual systems. Our results show that C. rufipes workers of all tested ages (between 1 and 42 days) express three genes encoding for ultraviolet (UV), blue (BL), and long-wavelength (LW1) sensitive opsins in their retina, which are likely to provide the substrate for trichromatic color vision. Expression levels of all three opsin genes increased significantly within the first two weeks of adulthood and following light exposure. Interestingly, the volumes of all three optic neuropils (lamina, medulla, and lobula) showed corresponding volume increases. Tracing of connections to higher visual centers in the mushroom bodies (MBs) revealed only one optic pathway, the anterior superior optic tract, emerging from the medulla and sending segregated input to the MB-calyx collar. The MB collar volumes and densities of synaptic complexes (microglomeruli, MGs) increased with age. Exposure to light for 4 days induced a decrease in MG densities followed by an increase after extended light exposure. This shows that plasticity in retinal opsin gene expression and structural neuroplasticity in primary and secondary visual centers comprise both \"experience-independent\" and \"experience-dependent\" elements. We conclude that both sources of plasticity in the visual system represent important components promoting optimal timing of the interior-forager transition and flexibility of age-related division of labor.

METHODS: This multicenter study was conducted by implementing a cross-sectional design to assess JCV seroprevalence, and a longitudinal design to assess the risk of JCV seroconversion. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between clinical variables and JCV seropositivity and risk of seroconversion. RESULTS: Of 581 MS patients, 64.9% patients were females. Mean age and mean disease duration were 33.9 and 8.4years respectively. JCV seroprevalence was 48.7%. Male gender (p=0.002), age at onset (p=0.001) and disease duration of 20 or more years (p=0.007) were significantly associated with JCV seropositivity. Among patients (n=125), followed longitudinally, the risk of JCV seroconversion was 17.6% (95% CI: 11.4%-25.4%) during a median follow-up of 18months. The proportion of seroreverted and pseudoconverted patients was 4% and 3.2% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: JCV seroprevalence among MS patients in the Middle East was lower than international figures. Male gender, age at onset and disease duration were significantly associated with JCV seropositivity. Risk of JCV seroconversion was higher than previously reported figures. Observed JCV sero-reversion or pseudo-conversion entail watchful period before embarking on a clinical decision.",

Their characterization in model organisms such as Arabidopsis has thus unraveled their fundamental roles in the control and regulation of essential developmental processes such as the floral transition, cell differentiation, gametogenesis, and/or the response/adaptation of plants to environmental stresses. In this review, we will focus on the methylation of histones functioning as a mark of activate transcription and we will try to highlight, based on recent findings, the more or less direct links between this mark and gene expression.

However, the prevalence of microalbuminuria reported in these studies was determined with one urine sample using a qualitative urine test. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria using a more stringent criterion of two positive quantitative urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) tests. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were followed up at a primary care clinic in Singapore. Patients were diagnosed to have albuminuria if they had two positive ACR tests within a seven-month period. RESULTS: A total of 786 patients with T2DM met the study's inclusion criteria. 55.7% were already on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The prevalence rates of micro- and macroalbuminuria were 14.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Patients with albuminuria were more likely to have hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-7.80). Diabetics with poorer diabetic control (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.79), and higher systolic (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14-2.49) and diastolic (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.22) blood pressures were more likely to have albuminuria. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the prevalence of microalbuminuria is significantly lower than that previously reported in Singapore. The presence of hypertension, poor diabetic control and suboptimal blood pressure control are possible risk factors for albuminuria in patients with T2DM.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially because their training has not fully prepared them to do so. To address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians' 'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new information, to use resources effectively and innovatively, and to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving in practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have developed study designs that use dynamic assessments to measure what trainees have acquired in the past, as well as what they are able to learn in the present. More recently, researchers have also started to emphasise and measure whether and how trainees take action to gain the information they need to learn. Knowing that there are study designs and emerging metrics for assessing PFL, the next question is how to design instruction that helps trainees develop PFL capacities. Although research evidence is still accumulating, the current evidence base suggests training that encourages 'productive failure' through guided discovery learning (i.e. where trainees solve problems and perform tasks without direct instruction, though often with some form of feedback) creates challenging conditions that enhance learning and equip trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation for future learning and the associated capacity of being adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical practice have been missed in most contemporary training and assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i) explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in the health care workplace to inform the design of instruction for developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours that relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential sociocultural barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to learn from their daily practice.",

However, a number of uncertainties remain over the optimal supportive treatment. The aim of this study was to provide evidence and expert-based recommendations on the optimal supportive haemostatic and antithrombotic treatment strategies for patients with DIC. A working group defined five relevant clinical scenarios. Published studies were systematically searched in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (up to May 2014). Seven internationally recognised experts were asked to independently provide clinical advice. A two-phase blinded data collection technique was used to reach consensus. Only three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the supportive management of DIC were identified. The RCTs (overall less than 100 patients) investigated the use of fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion and found no differences in survival between the intervention and control groups. The experts' approach was heterogeneous, although there was consensus that supportive management should vary according to the underlying cause, clinical manifestations and severity of blood test abnormalities. Platelet transfusion should be given to maintain platelet count > 50x10(9)/l in case of bleeding while a lower threshold of 20 to 30x10(9)/l may be used in DIC without bleeding. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin is advised until bleeding ensues or platelet count drops below 30x10(9)/l. In conclusion, in the absence of solid evidence from RCTs, an individualised supportive management of DIC is advisable based on the type of underlying disease, presence of bleeding or thrombotic complications and laboratory tests results.",

How can the brain trade off these competing quantities for optimal performance in different tasks? Can a network of spiking neurons carry out such computations, and what is its architecture? We propose a new model that takes input from V1-type orientation-selective spiking neurons and detects a target in the shortest time that is compatible with a given acceptable error rate. Subject to the assumption that the output of the primary visual cortex comprises Poisson neurons with known properties, our model is an ideal observer. The model has only five free parameters: the signal-to-noise ratio in a hypercolumn, the costs of false-alarm and false-reject errors versus the cost of time, and two parameters accounting for nonperceptual delays. Our model postulates two gain-control mechanisms--one local to hypercolumns and one global to the visual field--to handle variable scene complexity. Error rate and response time predictions match psychophysics data as we vary stimulus discriminability, scene complexity, and the uncertainty associated with each of these quantities. A five-layer spiking network closely approximates the optimal model, suggesting that known cortical mechanisms are sufficient for implementing visual search efficiently.",

When used as a filter, the polyamine-bearing side causes the micrometer-sized oil droplets to coalesce. The coalesced oil then fills fabric pores on the superhydrophobic side and selectively permeates it. Oil separation using this method is rapid and the separated oil is pure. Furthermore, the content of the model oil hexadecane (HD) in water after a separation can be reduced to less than 0.03+/-0.03 vol%. These features demonstrate the practical potential of this technology."

The measured ILSR spectral signatures in the survey spectra of the amino group region and in the broad spectral range revealed the presence of five different conformers, which were confirmed by the HB spectra. The determination of the structures of the conformers of 2-FPEA was assisted by quantum chemical calculations of the torsional potential energy surface and of the scaled harmonic Raman spectra. Comparison of the measured ILSR spectra with the calculated Raman spectra allowed us to identify one gauche structure with the ethylamino side chain folded toward the fluorine atom, two gauche structures with the ethylamino side chain folded to the opposite side and two anti conformers with extended tails. The effect of fluorination on the spectra and on the stability and structures of these species is discussed.",

The Beijing family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is prevalent worldwide and has been associated with the emergence of multidrug resistance. Sequence type (ST) 10 of the Beijing family is the most predominant in countries like Peru, Taiwan and Thailand. A sequence analysis was performed of 81 previously reported drug-resistant associated genes in multidrug-resistant and pan-susceptible strains of the Beijing family sequence type 10 of MTB. This analysis revealed 10 synonymous and 12 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are shared by all strains under study. One frameshift mutation was also observed to be common to all. These data might be useful in excluding some observed SNPs in drug-resistant-associated genes of MTB Beijing ST 10 when performing genotypic drug susceptibility assay.",

Most patients have a background of traditional coronary risk factors related to these cerebrovascular episodes. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old male, a regular user of anabolic steroids, presented to the emergency department with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and symptoms suggestive of an infarct of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery but in the absence of risk factors for ischaemic stroke. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of infarction in the region supplied by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Polycythaemia was found on haematological analysis, which we believe was secondary to the use of anabolic steroids. The patient was commenced on aspirin as per the stroke management protocol. There was resolution of neurological symptomatology six weeks after the episode, but no improvement in hearing. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of unilateral sensorineural hearing loss secondary to the use of anabolic steroids causing polycythaemia. This cause should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss, especially in young males, when no other risk factors can be identified.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oftentimes we are expected to make difficult decision when patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) present themselves before us. Among these cases, advanced liver cirrhosis, fulminant AIH with hepatic failure or pregnancy with highly active AIH will pose challenges on their own. In patients where standard treatment has failed, the risk of disease progression including liver transplantation has to be weighed against the risk of drug-related side effects, including infectious complications. KEY MESSAGES: Standard treatment of AIH includes the use of drugs like corticosteroids and usually azathioprine. However, up to 15% of patients will require second-line treatment. There are no prospective studies evaluating second- or third-line treatment regimens in AIH. In our opinion, it is essential to differentiate between those patients who are intolerant and those who do not respond sufficiently to standard treatment. For patients intolerant to prednisolone due to steroid-induced side effects, budesonide may be a feasible alternative, unless liver cirrhosis forbids its use. Our experience indicates that 6-mercaptopurine may be given as an alternative to azathioprine, especially in cases of gastrointestinal side effects, with good tolerance and response rates of up to 70%. As a more expensive alternative, mycophenolat mofetil (MMF) has been shown to effectively suppress disease activity in a majority of patients intolerant to azathioprine. Of note, MMF is contraindicated in pregnancy. In patients with insufficient response to azathioprine, the dose should be increased up to 2.5 mg/kg of body weight, and measurement of azathioprine metabolites (6TGN and MMP) may aid the optimal dosage. Several other immunosuppressive treatment strategies have been tested and published in small case series. These include the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine A and tacrolimus, mTOR inhibitors, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha treatment with infliximab, rituximab as well as cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to tell whether 1 strategy is superior to another in the case of difficult-to-treat AIH patients. Intolerance should be differentiated from insufficient response to standard treatment. The choice of second- and third-line treatment will depend on the comorbidities, patient's choice after informed consent and also local expertise.",

Histopathologic diagnosis of placenta creta is important, particularly in cases of hysterectomy because of unanticipated intractable postpartum hemorrhage. Previous studies have documented a higher amount and depth of myometrial infiltration by the implantation site intermediate trophoblast compared with controls. In addition, we have anecdotally observed chorionic villi in myometrial vascular spaces in specimens with placenta creta. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence and specificity of these features. Sixty-one postpartum hysterectomies, 44 with placenta creta and 17 without were reviewed. Villous intrusion into vascular spaces was recorded. Using immunohistochemistry for GATA3, the amount of intermediate trophoblast (number of positive cells in five 40x fields) and depth of trophoblast myometrial infiltration were assessed. Mean gestational ages of the creta group (34.4 yr; range, 20-43 yr) and control group (35 yr; range, 25-51 yr) were comparable. Presence of chorionic villi in myometrial vascular spaces was frequent in placenta creta: 31/44 versus 1/17 controls (70.4% vs. 5.8%, P<0.0001). This finding was more common in the percreta (87.5%) and increta (84%) than in the accreta (27.2%, P=0.0008). Mean depth of trophoblast myometrial invasion was greater in cretas (47.9%) than in controls (14.5%, P=0.004). Likewise, mean distance of deepest trophoblast to serosa was shorter in the cretas (7.3 mm) than in controls (23.8 mm, P<0.0001). These differences were, however, attributable to placentas increta and percreta. When only accretas and controls were compared, the myometrial depth of trophoblast was similar. The mean intermediate trophoblast cell count in the placental bed was greater in cretas (664) than in controls (288, P<0.0001). Such difference was seen in all creta cases despite the type (accreta 639, increta 676, percreta 661). A trophoblast count of >/=100 cells/high-power field was seen in 75.8% of cretas and 11.1% of controls (P=0.0009). For the first time, we document the finding of chorionic villi intrusion into myometrial vascular spaces, which is highly specific of placenta creta. In addition, assessment of the amount of intermediate trophoblast using GATA3 immunohistochemistry can assist in the diagnosis. We hypothesize that placental invasion in placenta creta is due, at least partially, to transformation of low-resistance myometrial vessels leading to subsequent protrusion of villi into their lumens, in the context of absent decidua.",

For one year the patient was treated with rivaroxaban (20 mg/d) due to venous thromboembolism and recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. Two weeks after amiodarone initiation (200 mg/d) hemoptysis occurred and computed tomography revealed unilateral pulmonary infiltrates with ground-glass opacities limited to the lower lobe of the left lung. The symptoms disappeared following discontinuation of the two medications and did not recur while rivaroxaban was reintroduced in a dose of 15 mg/d; measurement of anti-Xa activity confirmed it as a therapeutic dose. Amiodarone, that had been used for a short time and well tolerated a few years before, was definitely withdrawn.

The reasons for being tested which led to the diagnosis was voluntary testing in 32%, existing diseases in 53% (AIDS-defining diseases in 22%, sexually transmitted infections (STI) in 8%, diseases other than AIDS or STIs in 23%) and routine pre-surgery or on admission screening in 15%. 52% and 74% of the study patients and patients presented with AIDS, respectively, had never been tested. The median CD4 count in patients with history of previous testing (315/muL) was significantly higher than that of patients who had never been tested (203/muL, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Only 32% of the newly HIV diagnosed patients were diagnosed because of voluntary testing, and 53% were diagnosed due to presence of other diseases. These results remain unchanged from our previous report 10 years earlier (2000-2004) on newly diagnosed patients at the same clinic. HIV testing has not been widely used by newly diagnosed patients in the Tokyo metropolitan area.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP, rs2233434, Val194Ala) in the NFKBIE (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, epsilon) gene is known to be a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility polymorphism in the Japanese RA population and could be closely associated with nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. Inflammation caused by RA is sometimes associated with changes in expression levels of MTX (methotrexate) pathway-related genes. It is of interest to examine whether the NFKBIE gene had any influences on the mode of MTX action. METHODS: Both knockdown of NFKBIE gene expression and overexpression of wild-type NFKBIE and Val194Ala mutation were performed. A transfected human RA synovial cell line was cultured and then gene expressions in the MTX pathway were measured. In addition, we measured the uptake and efflux of MTX derivatives under the NFKBIE knockdown condition. RESULTS: Knockdown of NFKBIE reduced the mRNA for SLC19A1, a main MTX membrane transporter, and the intracellular accumulations of MTX derivatives. Moreover, our experiments also confirmed that overexpression of Val194Ala mutant NFKBIE decreased the SLC19A1 mRNA when compared to that of wild-type NFKBIE. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the impairment of NFKBIE gene function can reduce the uptake of MTX into cells, suggesting that the gene is an important factor for the RA outcome.",

The de-methylesterification by PMEs of the O6-methyl ester groups of the homogalacturonan component of pectin, exposing galacturonic acids, can occur processively or non-processively, respectively, describing sequential versus single de-methylesterification events occurring before enzyme-substrate dissociation. The high resolution x-ray structures of a PME from Aspergillus niger in deglycosylated and Asn-linked N-acetylglucosamine-stub forms reveal a 10(2/3)-turn parallel beta-helix (similar to but with less extensive loops than bacterial, plant, and insect PMEs). Capillary electrophoresis shows that this PME is non-processive, halophilic, and acidophilic. Molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic potential calculations reveal very different behavior and properties compared with processive PMEs. Specifically, uncorrelated rotations are observed about the glycosidic bonds of a partially de-methyl-esterified decasaccharide model substrate, in sharp contrast to the correlated rotations of processive PMEs, and the substrate-binding groove is negatively not positively charged.",

In this first in-human trial of a vaginal film for delivering the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of film and gel formulations were compared with placebo. METHODS: Sixty-one healthy HIV-negative women were randomized to daily dapivirine (0.05%) or placebo gel, or dapivirine (1.25 mg) or placebo film for seven days. The proportion of participants experiencing grade 2 and higher adverse events related to study product were compared. Plasma dapivirine concentrations were quantified. Paired cervical and vaginal tissue biopsies obtained  approximately 2 hours after the last dose were measured for tissue drug concentration and exposed to HIV in an ex vivo challenge assay. RESULTS: Two grade 2 related adverse events occurred in the placebo film group. Women randomized to gel and film products had 4 log10 higher of dapivirine in cervical and vaginal tissues than plasma. Although gel and film users had comparable plasma dapivirine concentrations, tissue concentrations of dapivirine were 3-5 times higher in the gel users when compared with film users. HIV replication in the ex vivo challenge assay was significantly reduced in vaginal tissues from women randomized to dapivirine film or gel; furthermore, tissue drug concentrations were highly correlated with HIV protection. Women rated the film more comfortable with less leakage but found it more difficult to insert than gel. DISCUSSION: Both film and gel delivered dapivirine at concentrations sufficient to block HIV ex vivo. This proof-of-concept study suggests film formulations for microbicides merit further investigation.",

In presence of various RAR response elements (RAREs), three oligomeric states of RAR-RXR DNA binding domains (DBDs) bound to RAREs (monomer, homo- or heterodimers) were detected and individually monitored to follow subunit assembly and disassembly upon RAREs' abundancy or sequence. In particular, a cooperative heterodimerization was shown with RARb2 DR5 (5 base pair spaced direct repeat) while a high heterogeneity reflecting random complex formation could be observed with the DR0 response elements, in agreement with native gel electrophoresis data or molecular modeling. Such MS information will help to identify the composition of species formed in solution and to define which DR sequence is specific for RAR-RXR heterodimerization.",

        "abstract": "The recruitment of GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs) to specific subcellular sites dictates where they activate small G proteins for the regulation of various cellular processes. Cytohesins are a conserved family of plasma membrane GEFs for Arf small G proteins that regulate endocytosis. Analyses of mammalian cytohesins have identified a number of recruitment mechanisms for these multi-domain proteins, but the conservation and developmental roles for these mechanisms are unclear. Here, we report how the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the Drosophila cytohesin Steppke affects its localization and activity at cleavage furrows of the early embryo. We found that the PH domain is necessary for Steppke furrow localization, and for it to regulate furrow structure. However, the PH domain was not sufficient for the localization. Next, we examined the role of conserved PH domain amino acid residues that are required for mammalian cytohesins to bind PIP3 or GTP-bound Arf G proteins. We confirmed that the Steppke PH domain preferentially binds PIP3 in vitro through a conserved mechanism. However, disruption of residues for PIP3 binding had no apparent effect on GFP-Steppke localization and effects. Rather, residues for binding to GTP-bound Arf G proteins made major contributions to this Steppke localization and activity. By analyzing GFP-tagged Arf and Arf-like small G proteins, we found that Arf1-GFP, Arf6-GFP and Arl4-GFP, but not Arf4-GFP, localized to furrows. However, analyses of embryos depleted of Arf1, Arf6 or Arl4 revealed either earlier defects than occur in embryos depleted of Steppke, or no detectable furrow defects, possibly because of redundancies, and thus it was difficult to assess how individual Arf small G proteins affect Steppke. Nonetheless, our data show that the Steppke PH domain and its conserved residues for binding to GTP-bound Arf G proteins have substantial effects on Steppke localization and activity in early Drosophila embryos.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3) has been perceived as a tumour suppressor. Paradoxically, CDKN3 is often overexpressed in human cancer. It was unclear if CDKN3 overexpression is linked to alternative splicing variants or mutations that produce dominant-negative CDKN3. METHODS: We analysed CDKN3 expression and its association with patient survival in three cohorts of lung adenocarcinoma. We also examined CDKN3 mutations in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Moffitt Cancer Center's Total Cancer Care (TCC) projects. CDKN3 transcripts were further analysed in a panel of cell lines and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. CDKN3 mRNA and protein levels in different cell cycle phases were examined. RESULTS: CDKN3 is overexpressed in non small cell lung cancer. High CDKN3 expression is associated with poor overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma. Two CDKN3 transcripts were detected in all samples. These CDKN3 transcripts represent the full length CDKN3 mRNA and a normal transcript lacking exon 2, which encodes an out of frame 23-amino acid peptide with little homology to CDKN3. CDKN3 mutations were found to be very rare. CDKN3 mRNA and protein were elevated during the mitosis phase of cell cycle. CONCLUSIONS: CDKN3 overexpression is prognostic of poor overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma. CDKN3 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma is not attributed to alternative splicing or mutation but is likely due to increased mitotic activity, arguing against CDKN3 as a tumour suppressor.",

Two mutations of CHD7 were identified including a novel splice-site mutation (c.2443-2A>G) and a previously known frameshift mutation (c.2504_2508delATCTT). We performed exon trapping analysis to determine the effect of the c.2443-2A>G mutation at the transcriptional level, and found that it caused a complete skip of exon 7 and splicing at a cryptic splice acceptor site. Our current study is the second study demonstrating an exon 7 deficit in CHD7. Results of previous studies suggest that the c.2443-2A>G mutation affects the formation of nasal tissues and the neural retina during early development, resulting in choanal atresia and coloboma, respectively.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The bacterial contamination of soft tissues and bone in open fractures leads to an infection rate of up to 50%. Pathogens and their resistance against therapeutic agents change with time and vary in different regions. In this work, our aims were to characterize the bacterial spectrum present in open fractures, analyze the bacterial resistance to antibiotic agents and question the EAST guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis after open fractures in a German Trauma Network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study and included all patients with open fractures from 1(st) of January 2011 until the 31(st) of December 2014 in four hospitals of the trauma network cologne. Soft tissue damage was classified according to the Gustilo Anderson classification. RESULTS: We included 123 patients. Forty-five injuries (37%) were classified I degrees , 45 (37%) as II degrees  and 33 (27%) as III degrees . Lower leg (34%) was the most commonly injured location. An antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to 109 patients (89%). In 107 of them (98%) a cephalosporin or cephalosporin combination was given. In 35 of the patients (28%), microbiological samples were taken of the fracture site. Wound cultures were positive in 21 patients (60%). Fifty percent of the bacterial detections occurred in III degrees  fractures. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (COST) were the most frequent pathogens. In II degrees  open fractures one gram-negative strain was isolated. Fewest resistances were seen against quinolones and co-trimoxazole. DISCUSSION: The recommended EAST guideline prophylaxis would have covered all but one bacterium (97% of positive cultures). One Escherichia coli was found in a II degrees  open fracture and would have been missed. One of the isolated Staphylococci epidermidis and an Enterococcus faecium were resistant against gentamycin and first- and second-generation-cephalosporin's which were used as prophylaxis frequently. However, a regional adaption of the EAST guidelines seems not justified due to the rather low number of cases in our study. CONCLUSION: The EAST guideline seems to be adequate in a high percentage of cases (97%) in the setting of the trauma network cologne. Further research should be guided at identification of initial open fracture pathogens to improve the efficiency of antibiotic prophylaxis.",

Serotyping was performed using polyclonal somatic and flagellar antisera. Of 5953 isolates, 5770 were identified as Listeria spp., from which 3429 (59.4%) were L. innocua, 2248 (38.9%) were L. monocytogenes, and 93 (1.6%) were other Listeria spp. L. innocua was predominantly isolated from 1990 to 2000, while L. monocytogenes was from 2001 to 2012. Regarding the serotype distribution in the foods, serotypes 1/2a and 4b were most common in processed meat and ready-to-eat products, respectively; serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b were the most common in nonprocessed meat. The results above confirm the presence of the main serotypes of L. monocytogenes in different parts of the food chain from three regions of the country and emphasize the importance of improving the control measures, as tolerance zero policy and microbiological surveillance in Brazil.",

        "abstract": "Catfish is the leading aquaculture species in the United States. The interspecific hybrid catfish produced by mating female channel catfish with male blue catfish outperform both of their parent species in a number of traits. However, mass production of the hybrids has been difficult because of reproductive isolation. Investigations of genome structure and organization of the hybrids provide insights into the genetic basis for maintenance of species divergence in the face of gene flow, thereby helping develop strategies for introgression and efficient production of the hybrids for aquaculture. In this study, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using the hybrid catfish system with the catfish 250K SNP array. A total of 26,238 SNPs were mapped to 29 linkage groups, with 12,776 unique marker positions. The linkage map spans approximately 3240 cM with an average intermarker distance of 0.25 cM. A fraction of markers (986 of 12,776) exhibited significant deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio of segregation, and they were clustered in major genomic blocks across 15 LGs, most notably LG9 and LG15. The distorted markers exhibited significant bias for maternal alleles among the backcross progenies, suggesting strong selection against the blue catfish alleles. The clustering of distorted markers within genomic blocks should lend insights into speciation as marked by incompatibilities between the two species. Such findings should also have profound implications for understanding the genomic evolution of closely related species as well as the introgression of hybrid production programs in aquaculture.",

In this study, we found mediatory role of microRNA-31 in gamma-radiation-induced apoptosis in a model insect cell line Sf9 carrying well-conserved apoptotic machinery. Mature microRNA-31 is perfectly conserved amongst insects; hence we used biotinylated probes designed from Bombyx mori sequence for its successful detection in Sf9 cells. Target identification using Bombyx mori 3'UTRs predicted miR-31's potential role in Lepidopteran apoptosis, which prompted us to investigate alterations in its expression during radiation-induced cell death. We found significant overexpression of Sf-miR-31 following lethal dose (1,000Gy-3,000Gy) irradiation. Its mediatory role was finally confirmed as antisense-microRNA-31 could successfully inhibit radiation-induced cytochrome-c release, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. While Bax/Bcl-2 expression remained unchanged, lethal radiation doses induced Bim overexpression and direct Bim-Bax interaction (co-immunoprecipitation) which is not yet unequivocally demonstrated during apoptosis. Quite important, these events were found to be dependent on radiation-induced miR-31 overexpression, as antisense-miR-31 inhibited both the responses and resulted in significant inhibition of cell death. Pro-apoptotic role of miR-31 was further confirmed when miR-31 mimic induced apoptosis involving similar Bim/Bax alterations. Therefore, our study reveals an important mediatory role of miR-31 in radiation-induced cell death.",

Infants will have a coryzal prodrome lasting one to three days before developing a persistent cough. Fever and reduced feeding are common and very young infants may present with apnoeic episodes. Symptoms normally peak between days three to five of the illness. There will be evidence of increased work of breathing such as tachypnoea, in drawing/recession, head bobbing, grunting, nasal flaring or tracheal tug. Auscultation typically reveals wheeze and/or crepitations throughout both lung fields. Most children with bronchiolitis do not need to be referred to secondary care and can be managed safely at home.

The composition of the prolamin fraction of the barley parental line cv. Golden Promise was resolved using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the protein band were excised and the proteins identified by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Subsequent SDS-PAGE separation and analysis of the prolamin fraction of the transgenic lines revealed a reduction in the amounts of C-hordeins and increases in the content of other hordein family members. Analysis of the AA composition of the transgenic lines showed that the level of essential amino acids increased with a concomitant reduction in proline and glutamine. Both the barley C-hordein and wheat omega-gliadin genes proved successful for RNAi-gene mediated suppression of barley C-hordein level. All transgenic lines that exhibited a reduction for C-hordein showed off-target effects: the lines exhibited increased level of B/gamma-hordein while D-hordein level was reduced. Furthermore, the multicopy insertions correlated negatively with silencing.",

        "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major type of heart failure resulting from loss of systolic function. Naturally occurring canine DCM is a widely accepted experimental paradigm for studying human DCM. 2-Deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) can be used by myosin and is a superior energy substrate over ATP for cross-bridge formation and increased systolic function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of dATP on contractile function of cardiac myofibrils from dogs with naturally occurring DCM. We measured actomyosin NTPase activity and contraction/relaxation properties of isolated myofibrils from nonfailing (NF) and DCM canine hearts. NTPase assays indicated replacement of ATP with dATP significantly increased myofilament activity in both NF and DCM samples. dATP significantly improved maximal tension of DCM myofibrils to the NF sample level. dATP also restored Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension that was reduced in DCM samples. Similarly, dATP increased the kinetics of contractile activation (kACT), with no impact on the rate of cross-bridge tension redevelopment (kTR). Thus, the activation kinetics (kACT/kTR) that were reduced in DCM samples were restored for dATP to NF sample levels. dATP had little effect on relaxation. The rate of early slow-phase relaxation was slightly reduced with dATP, but its duration was not, nor was the fast-phase relaxation or times to 50 and 90% relaxation. Our findings suggest that myosin utilization of dATP improves cardiac myofibril contractile properties of naturally occurring DCM canine samples, restoring them to NF levels, without compromising relaxation. This suggests elevation of cardiac dATP is a promising approach for the treatment of DCM.",

The objectives of this population-based observational study were to describe the clinical epidemiology of HFpEF in younger (<65 years) as compared with older (>/=65 years) patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the medical records of residents of central Massachusetts hospitalized with HFpEF at all 11 greater Worcester (MA) medical centers during the 5 study years of 1995, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. Among the 2398 patients hospitalized with confirmed HFpEF, 357 (14.9%) were <65 years old. Younger patients were more likely to be male, non-Caucasian, obese, and to have a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease than older patients with HFpEF. Younger patients hospitalized with HFpEF were less likely to have received commonly prescribed cardiac medications, had a longer hospital stay, and experienced significantly lower post-discharge death rates than older hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION: While HFpEF is predominantly a disease of old age, data from longitudinal studies remain needed to identify risk factors in younger individuals that may predispose them to the development of HFpEF.",

The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the two novel isolates exhibit 99.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with each other. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain NEAU-JM1(T) showed it to be closely related to Catellatospora methionotrophica JCM 7543(T) (99.4 % sequence similarity), Catellatospora coxensis DSM 44901(T) (99.4 %), Catellatospora citrea DSM 44097(T) (99.3 %) and Catellatospora chokoriensis JCM 12950(T) (99.2 %), and that of strain NEAU-CL2(T) to C. citrea DSM 44097(T) (99.4 %), C. methionotrophica JCM 7543(T) (99.3 %), C. chokoriensis JCM 12950(T) (99.3 %) and C. coxensis DSM 44901(T) (99.2 %). However, the DNA-DNA hybridization value between strains NEAU-JM1(T) and NEAU-CL2(T) was 62.2 %, and the values between the two strains and their close phylogenetic relatives were also below 70 %. With reference to phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA hybridization results, the two strains can be distinguished from each other and their close phylogenetic relatives. Thus, strains NEAU-JM1(T) and NEAU-CL2(T) can be concluded to represent two novel species of the genus Catellatospora, for which the names Catellatospora vulcania sp. nov. and Catellatospora paridis sp. nov. are proposed.

In the present study, we investigated the interaction between 4-HNE and Src (a non-receptor tyrosine kinase) for its involvement in the molecular modulation of the inflammatory signaling pathway utilizing the YPEN-1 cell system. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that 4-HNE phosphorylates (activates) Src at Tyr416 via adduct formation. In addition, LC-MS/MS and a docking simulation model revealed an addiction site at the Cys248 residue of Src, resulting in the stimulation of downstream p38, ERK/AP-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) signaling in YPEN-1 cells. The role of 4-HNE-activated Src in downstream inflammatory signaling was further investigated using dasatinib (a Src inhibitor) and by siRNA knockdown of Src. p38 and ERK were directly regulated by Src, as revealed by immunoblotting of the phosphorylated forms of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are key elements in the signaling transduction pathway initiated by Src. The study also shows that Src modulates the HNE-enhanced activation of AP-1 and the expression of COX-2 (a target gene of AP-1). Together, the results of this study show that 4-HNE stimulates Src tyrosine kinase in activation of the inflammation process.",

Their close families and friends have served as informal care-givers after the closing down of mental hospitals, and open-care units have not sufficiently met the needs of the patients. Non-profit organizations and private initiatives such as the Association of families to persons with schizophrenia (Schizofreniforbundet) have played a crucial role for the well-being of patients and their families. Anti-stigmatizing campaigns and processes have proven successful and are possible to perform on all levels, private, in society, and on the political arena. Both self-stigmatization and marginalization would diminish if individuals with schizophrenia were let in on the open labor market. An equal health care, both psychiatric and somatic, is today a utopia for individuals with schizophrenia and other forms of psychoses.",

The technique of differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a very accessible method to determine protein stability as a function of the formulation chemistry and the temperature. A diverse set of 252 soluble protein samples was subjected to a standard formulation-screening protocol using DSF. Automated analysis of the DSF results suggest that in over 35% of cases buffer screening significantly increases the stability of the protein sample. Of the 28 standard formulations tested, three stood out as being statistically better than the others: these included a formulation containing the buffer citrate, long known to be ;protein friendly'; bis-tris and ADA were also identified as being very useful buffers in protein formulations.",

Our results showed that the use of a bioengineered bone substitute was associated with more symmetrical palate growth as compared to the controls, and the length and height of the palate were very similar on both sides of the palate, with differences from negative controls 4 months after artificial bone grafting for bone length. The histological analysis revealed that the regenerated bone was well organized and expressed osteocalcin. In contrast, bone corresponding to control animals without tissue grafting was immature, with areas of osteoid tissue and remodelling, as determined by MMP-14 expression. These results suggest that bone substitutes may be a useful strategy to induce the formation of a well-structured palate bone, which could prevent the growth alterations found in cleft palate patients. This opens a door to a future clinical application of these bone substitutes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Visualization of infection and the associated host response has been challenging in adult vertebrates. Owing to their transparency, zebrafish larvae have been used to directly observe infection in vivo; however, such larvae have not yet developed a functional adaptive immune system. Cells involved in adaptive immunity mature later and have therefore been difficult to access optically in intact animals. Thus, the study of many aspects of vertebrate infection requires dissection of adult organs or ex vivo isolation of immune cells. Recently, CLARITY and PACT (passive clarity technique) methodologies have enabled clearing and direct visualization of dissected organs. Here, we show that these techniques can be applied to image host-pathogen interactions directly in whole animals. CLARITY and PACT-based clearing of whole adult zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mouse lungs enables imaging of mycobacterial granulomas deep within tissue to a depth of more than 1 mm. Using established transgenic lines, we were able to image normal and pathogenic structures and their surrounding host context at high resolution. We identified the three-dimensional organization of granuloma-associated angiogenesis, an important feature of mycobacterial infection, and characterized the induction of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) within the granuloma using an established fluorescent reporter line. We observed heterogeneity in TNF induction within granuloma macrophages, consistent with an evolving view of the tuberculous granuloma as a non-uniform, heterogeneous structure. Broad application of this technique will enable new understanding of host-pathogen interactions in situ.",

Flight Surgeons are tasked with seeking out appropriate medical care that reduces pilot risk while providing squadron-specific mission support. CASE: An F-5 pilot presented with chronic LBP seeking nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapy. After 3 days of manual treatment that corrected sacral, pelvic, and lumbar dysfunction, this pilot reported greater than 80% reduction in overall pain and was able to return to flight. DISCUSSION: Although underreported, a radiographic study and multiple case reports, identify LBP as a significant problem among tactical air (tac air) pilots. As such, LBP can become an in-flight distraction increasing the risk of a mishap. Benefits of osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT) as an adjunct to treatment of LBP in civilian population were recently demonstrated. This case identified a tac air pilot with chronic LBP that responded to three OMT sessions focused at the sacrum, lumbar, and pelvis. CONCLUSION: The use of manual therapy in the form of OMT significantly reduced this pilot's pain in three visits and maintained flight status per aeromedical waiver guidelines.",

        "abstract": "The US Supreme Court's recent decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. declared, for the first time, that isolated human genes cannot be patented. Many have wondered how genes were ever the subjects of patents. The answer lies in a nuanced understanding of both legal and scientific history. Since the early twentieth century, \"products of nature\" were not eligible to be patented unless they were \"isolated and purified\" from their surrounding environment. As molecular biology advanced, and the capability to isolate genes both physically and by sequence came to fruition, researchers (and patent offices) began to apply patent-law logic to genes themselves. These patents, along with other biological patents, generated substantial social and political criticism. Myriad Genetics, a company with patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2, two genes critical to assessing early-onset breast and ovarian cancer risk, and with a particularly controversial business approach, became the antagonist in an ultimately successful campaign to overturn gene patents in court. Despite Myriad's defeat, some questions concerning the rights to monopolize genetic information remain. The history leading to that defeat may be relevant to these future issues.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 195 patients with recurrent or progressive breast cancer who received anticancer treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital between January 2008 and May 2012. Detailed data concerning the patients' demographic, familial, and clinical characteristics were collected, and multivariate and Cox logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of these characteristics on the place of EOL care and on survival, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients (34.9 %) died in a hospital, 26 patients (13.3 %) at home, and 101 patients (51.8 %) in hospice. Most of the patients having caregivers received EOL care at palliative care facilities (hospice or home) [odds ratio (OR) 2.57; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1-6.6; p = 0.05]. In contrast, patients with factors suggesting a clinically severe status (performance status >/=2, use of opioids, delirium, and ascites) more often received EOL care in a hospital. Among patients who received EOL care at hospice or home, patients with minor children received EOL care at home (OR 0.08; 95 % CI 0.02-0.38; p = 0.001). Patients with brain metastases chose hospice (OR 12.37; 95 % CI 2.25-68.13; p = 0.004). Furthermore, having a caregiver was associated with prolonged survival (hazard ratio 0.62; 95 % CI 0.39-0.97; p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Familial factors such as having children and caregivers significantly influenced the place of EOL care for terminally ill breast cancer patients.",

A metagenomic analysis (pyrosequencing) of total bacterial diversity including anammox population in five autotrophic nitrogen removal technologies, two bench-scale models (MBR and Low Temperature CANON) and three full-scale bioreactors (anammox, CANON, and DEMON), was successfully carried out by optimization of primer selection and PCR conditions (annealing temperature). The universal primer 530F was identified as the best candidate for total bacteria and anammox bacteria diversity coverage. Salt-adjusted optimum annealing temperature of primer 530F was calculated (47 degrees C) and hence a range of annealing temperatures of 44-49 degrees C was tested. Pyrosequencing data showed that annealing temperature of 45 degrees C yielded the best results in terms of species richness and diversity for all bioreactors analyzed.",

Plasma monoamine metabolite levels are possible indicators of clinical symptoms or response to antipsychotics in schizophrenia. We investigated the association between five-factor model components and plasma monoamine metabolites levels to explore the model's biological basis. Plasma levels of homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography in 65 Japanese patients with schizophrenia. Significant negative correlation between plasma 5-HIAA levels and the depression/anxiety component was found. Furthermore, significant positive correlation was found between plasma MHPG levels and the excitement component. Plasma HVA levels were not correlated with any five-factor model component. These results suggest that the five-factor model of the PANSS may have a biological basis, and may be useful for elucidating the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Assessment using the five-factor model may enable understanding of monoaminergic dysfunction, possibly allowing more appropriate medication selection. Further studies of a larger number of first-episode schizophrenia patients are needed to confirm and extend these results.",

        "abstract": "The advent of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has resulted in a dramatic reduction in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. However, the emergence and spread of antiretroviral drug resistance (DR) threaten to negatively impact treatment regimens and compromise efforts to control the epidemic. It is recommended that surveillance of drug resistance occur in conjunction with scale-up efforts to ensure that appropriate first-line therapy is offered relative to the resistance that exists. However, standard resistance testing methods used in Sub-Saharan Africa rely on techniques that do not include low abundance DR variants (LADRVs) that have been documented to contribute to treatment failure. The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) has been shown to be more sensitive to LADRVS. We have carried out a preliminary investigation using NGS to determine the prevalence of LDRVS among a drug-naive population in North Rift Kenya. Antiretroviral-naive patients attending a care clinic in North Rift Kenya were requested to provide and with consent provided blood samples for DR analysis. DNA was extracted and amplified and nested PCR was conducted on the pol RT region using primers tagged with multiplex identifiers (MID). Resulting PCR amplicons were purified, quantified, and pyrosequenced using a GS FLX Titanium PicoTiterPlate (Roche). Valid pyrosequencing reads were aligned with HXB-2 and the frequency and distribution of nucleotide and amino acid changes were determined using an in-house Perl script. DR mutations were identified using the IAS-USA HIV DR mutation database. Sixty samples were successfully sequenced of which 26 were subtype A, 9 were subtype D, 2 were subtype C, and the remaining were recombinants. Forty-six (76.6%) had at least one drug resistance mutation, with 25 (41.6%) indicated as major and the remaining 21 (35%) indicated as minor. The most prevalent mutation was NRTI position K219Q/R (11/46, 24%) followed by NRTI M184V (5/46, 11%) and NNRTI K103N (4/46, 9%). Our use of NGS technology revealed a high prevalence of LADRVs among drug-naive populations in Kenya, a region with predominantly non-B subtypes. The impact of these mutations on the clinical outcome of ART can be ascertained only through long-term follow-up.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Activation of the IL-1/NF-kappaB inflammatory stress pathway and induction of SELE expression in the trabecular meshwork (TBM) is a marker for high-tension glaucomas of diverse etiology. Pathway activation stimulates aqueous outflow and protects against oxidative stress, but may be damaging in the long-term. MYOC mutations have been causally linked to high-tension forms of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This study investigated a possible link between MYOC mutations and activation of the IL-1/NF-kappaB pathway and expression of SELE. METHODS: We constructed MYOC expression vectors with mutations at sites that cause POAG. Mutations (Q368X, Y437H, A427T) were selected to represent proteins with differing POAG-causing potency (Q368X > Y437H > A427T) and intracellular retention behavior (Q368X and Y437H retained, A427T released). The constructs were made in two different kinds of vectors; one a plasmid designed for transient transfection (pCMV6), and one a doxycycline-inducible lentiviral vector (pSLIK) for stable cell transduction. The immortalized human trabecular meshwork line TM-1 was used for all expression studies. Expression of IL1A mRNA was determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, as well as a set of five other genes associated with signaling pathways linked to glaucoma: IL1B and IL6 (NF-kappaB pathway), TGFB2 and ACTA2 (TGF-beta pathway) and FOXO1 (E2F1 apoptotic pathway). An ELISA was used to quantify IL1A protein released into culture media. To quantify intracellular NF-kappaB activity, we transiently transfected stably transduced cell lines with a luciferase expression vector under control of the IL8 promoter (containing an NF-kappaB response element). RESULTS: Transiently expressed wild-type MYOC was released into cell culture media, whereas mutant MYOCs Q368X and Y437H remained within cells. Both mutant MYOCs activated the IL-1/ NF-kappaB pathway, significantly stimulating expression of IL1A and IL1B. However Y437H, which causes a severe glaucoma phenotype, was less effective than Q368X, which causes a moderate glaucoma phenotype. In addition, the retained mutants stimulated expression of stress response genes ACTA2 and FOXO1. Unexpectedly, wild-type MYOC significantly decreased expression of IL6 and TGFB2, to approximately half of the control levels, and expression of IL1B and ACTA2 was also slightly decreased. Induction of MYOC mutants Q368X and Y437H in stably transduced cell lines significantly stimulated the level of IL1A protein released into culture media. Once again however, the effect of the severe MYOC mutant Y437H was less than the effect of the moderate MYOC mutant Q368X. In contrast, induced expression of the intracellularly retained mutant MYOC A427T or wild-type MYOC did not change the amount of IL1A protein in culture media. Induction of Y437H MYOC plus IL1A treatment increased NF-kappaB activity by 25% over IL1A alone. In contrast, induction of Q368X or A427T plus IL1A treatment did not significantly affect NF-kappaB activity over IL1A alone. However, wild-type MYOC expression inhibited IL1A-stimulated NF-kappaB activity. We also observed that endogenous MYOC expression was induced by IL1A in TM-1 cells and primary TBM cell cultures. SELE was co-expressed with MYOC in the primary cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that POAG-causing MYOC mutants activate the IL-1/NF-kappaB pathway, with activation levels correlated with intracellular retention of the protein, but not POAG-causing potency. Unexpectedly, it was also discovered that wild-type MYOC inhibits activation of the IL-1/NF-kappaB pathway, and that activation of the IL-1/NF-kappaB pathway stimulates expression of MYOC. This is the first evidence that glaucoma-causing MYOC mutants can activate the inflammatory response and that wild-type MYOC has anti-inflammatory activity.",

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were defined as lineage negative (CD3(-), CD19(-), CD56(-)), HLA-DR(-/low), CD11b(+) and CD33(+). Classification of granulocytic (GrMDSC) and monocytic (MoMDSC) subsets was based on the CD15 and CD14 expression, respectively. Unlike the MoMDSC, that were present in 60% of healthy controls and 15% of melanoma patients, the GrMDSC were present in all examined participants, and the melanoma patients were found to have statistically higher frequencies compared with healthy controls. Accordingly, we kept focused on GrMDSC frequencies in relation to the melanoma stages and course of the disease. The GrMDSC values are highest in stage IV melanoma patients, with statistical significance compared with stages IA, IB, IIA and IIB. Patients with progression had statistically higher GrMDSC counts comparing with those with stable disease (P = 0.0079). Patients who had progression-free interval (PFI) < 12 months showed significantly higher GrMDSC values compared with those with PFI > 12 months (P = 0.0333). GrMDSC showed significant negative correlation with PFI intervals (P = 0.0095). The GrMDSC subset was predominant in all our patients. We confirmed that GrMDSC do accumulate early in the peripheral blood of melanoma patients and their frequencies correlate narrowly with the clinical stage and the spread of the disease. The increase in GrMDSC frequencies correlates well with a progressive disease and could be considered a potential predictive biomarker of high-risk melanoma cases that are more likely to have a shorter PFI.",

We show that single-particle dynamical properties behave analogously in collisional and continuous-time representations, exhibiting apparent crossovers between the fluid and the solid phases. We find that, both in collisional and continuous-time representation, the mean-squared displacement, velocity autocorrelation functions, intermediate scattering functions, and self-part of the van Hove function (propagator) closely reproduce the same behavior exhibited by the corresponding quantities in granular media, colloids, and supercooled liquids close to the glass or jamming transition.",

Although diverse cancer cell types are sensitive to oncolytic viruses, one of the major challenges of oncolytic virotherapy is that the sensitivity to oncolysis ranges among different cancer cell types. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of action is not fully understood. Here, we report that activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling significantly sensitizes refractory cancer cells to alphavirus M1 in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. We find that activation of the cAMP signaling pathway inhibits M1-induced expression of antiviral factors in refractory cancer cells, leading to prolonged and severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and cell apoptosis. We also demonstrate that M1-mediated oncolysis, which is enhanced by cAMP signaling, involves the factor, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1 (Epac1), but not the classical cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Taken together, cAMP/Epac1 signaling pathway activation inhibits antiviral factors and improves responsiveness of refractory cancer cells to M1-mediated virotherapy.",

Those valves' leaflets enlarge with altered collagen fiber architecture, content, and cross-linking and biphasic changes (decreases, then increases) in extensibility during gestation. This study extends our analyses to right-sided valves, with additional compositional measurements for all valves. Valve leaflets were harvested from nonpregnant heifers and pregnant cows. Leaflet structure was characterized by leaflet dimensions, and ECM composition was determined using standard biochemical assays. Histological studies assessed changes in cellular and ECM components. Leaflet mechanical properties were assessed using equibiaxial mechanical testing. Collagen thermal stability and cross-linking were assessed using denaturation and hydrothermal isometric tension tests. Pulmonary and tricuspid leaflet areas increased during pregnancy by 35 and 55%, respectively. Leaflet thickness increased by 20% only in the pulmonary valve and largely in the fibrosa (30% thickening). Collagen crimp length was reduced in both the tricuspid (61%) and pulmonary (42%) valves, with loss of crimped area in the pulmonary valve. Thermomechanics showed decreased collagen thermal stability with surprisingly maintained cross-link maturity. The pulmonary leaflet exhibited the biphasic change in extensibility seen in left side valves, whereas the tricuspid leaflet mechanics remained largely unchanged throughout pregnancy. The tricuspid valve exhibits a remodeling response during pregnancy that is significantly diminished from the other three valves. All valves of the heart remodel in pregnancy in a manner distinct from cardiac pathology, with much similarity valve to valve, but with interesting valve-specific responses in the aortic and tricuspid valves.",

In addition to the direct pathway of IPV to poor health, thematic analysis revealed an indirect multi-tiered pathway with complex trajectories among IPV, HI, and poor health. These trajectories included material HI (homelessness, high mobility, evictions, problems paying rent, hiding, and landlord discrimination), psychological HI (feeling unsafe, low self-esteem, and poor control), and social trajectories (financial problems, loss of employment, income, or social networks, and leaving school). These trajectories elevated stress and decreased self-care (unhealthy behaviors, substance abuse, and reduced medical compliance) and exacerbated poor health already compromised by IPV. Depending on her specific context, each woman experienced these pathways and trajectories differently. Moreover, the women's experiences differed across three time periods: before, immediately after, and long after leaving an abusive relationship.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glenoid component loosening after total shoulder arthroplasty is one of the most common causes of failure. A hybrid glenoid that uses peripherally cemented pegs and a central press-fit post may improve implant longevity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked, compared with polyethylene pegged glenoid implants, do hybrid glenoid implants with a titanium post provide (1) better ingrowth with fewer radiolucencies, (2) better outcome and pain scores, and (3) lower risk of complications and revisions? METHODS: Between 2009 and 2010, 126 patients underwent primary total shoulder arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Patients were included in this retrospective study if they consented for inclusion in a shoulder arthroplasty registry, had complete baseline and 2-year data, and had complete radiographs. Eighty-three (67%) were available at an average followup of 3.2 years (range, 24-45 months). Forty received a conventional all-polyethylene pegged glenoid and 43 received a hybrid component. During the period in question, four of the participating surgeons used only one implant, and four used only the other; there was one high-volume surgeon in each of the study groups. Radiographs were taken at the 2-year followup and analyzed for radiolucent lines. CT scans were obtained randomly for 10 patients with hybrid glenoid implants to assess bone ongrowth. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, VAS score, complications and revisions were recorded. RESULTS: At final followup, radiolucent lines between the two study groups were not different (hybrid, 1.0 +/- 0.4; pegged, 1.6 +/- 0.3; mean difference, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.85-1.72; p = 0.323). Final VAS pain scores were not different (hybrid, 1.2 +/- 0.2; pegged, 1.5 +/- 0.3; p = 0.056). Change in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores were not different (hybrid, 33.7 +/- 7.3; pegged, 35.5 +/- 8.2; p = 0.283). There were no differences in complication risk (hybrid, one of 43 [2.3%]; pegged, three of 40 [7.5%]; relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.82-3.12; p = 0.061). CONCLUSIONS: With the numbers available and at early followup, there were no differences between the hybrid and pegged glenoids in terms of fixation, functional outcome, pain scores, and complications. CT scans confirmed bone ongrowth on the porous titanium post in a small subcohort of patients. Further studies are needed to determine how this new implant will perform with time. Until then, its use should be initiated with caution. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",

Here we address this limitation by developing a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) platform that employs crude extracts from a genomically recoded strain of Escherichia coli for site-specific, co-translational incorporation of phosphoserine into proteins. We apply this system to the robust production of up to milligram quantities of human MEK1 kinase. Then, we recapitulate a physiological signalling cascade in vitro to evaluate the contributions of site-specific phosphorylation of mono- and doubly phosphorylated forms on MEK1 activity. We discover that only one phosphorylation event is necessary and sufficient for MEK1 activity. Our work sets the stage for using CFPS as a rapid high-throughput technology platform for direct expression of programmable phosphoproteins containing multiple phosphorylated residues. This work will facilitate study of phosphorylation-dependent structure-function relationships, kinase signalling networks and kinase inhibitor drugs.",

However, only a few studies are currently available about other repetitive sequences. Here, the chromosomal location of small nuclear RNA genes, identified as U1 and U2 snRNA clusters, was established and compared to the distribution of 5S rDNA and histone clusters in 5 Astyanax species (A. paranae, A. fasciatus, A. bockmanni, A. altiparanae, and A. jordani) using FISH. The cytogenetic mapping of U1 and U2 snRNA demonstrated a conserved pattern in the number of sites per genome independent of the location in Astyanax species. The location of the U1 snRNA gene was frequently associated with 5S rDNA sequences, indicating a possible interaction between the distinct repetitive DNA families. Finally, comparisons involving the location of U1 and U2 snRNA clusters in the chromosomes of Astyanax species revealed a very diverse pattern, suggesting that many rearrangements have occurred during the diversification process of this group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are 27 receiving trauma hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. There has not been an audit system in place to monitor and measure processes and outcomes of care. The National Office of Clinical Audit (NOCA) is now working to implement Major Trauma Audit (MTA) in Ireland using the well-established National Health Service (NHS) UK Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN). AIMS: The aim of this report is to highlight the implementation process of MTA in Ireland to raise awareness of MTA nationally and share lessons that may be of value to other health systems undertaking the development of MTA. METHODS: The National Trauma Audit Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, consisting of champions and stakeholders in trauma care, in 2010 advised on the adaptation of TARN for Ireland. In 2012, the Emergency Medicine Program endorsed TARN and in setting up the National Emergency Medicine Audit chose MTA as the first audit project. A major trauma governance group was established representing stakeholders in trauma care, a national project co-ordinator was recruited and a clinical lead nominated. Using Survey Monkey, the chief executives of all trauma receiving hospitals were asked to identify their hospital's trauma governance committee, trauma clinical lead and their local trauma data co-ordinator. Hospital Inpatient Enquiry systems were used to identify to hospitals an estimate of their anticipated trauma audit workload. RESULTS: There are 25 of 27 hospitals now collecting data using the TARN trauma audit platform. These hospitals have provided MTA Clinical Leads, allocated data co-ordinators and incorporated MTA reports formally into their clinical governance, quality and safety committee meetings. There has been broad acceptance of the NOCA escalation policy by hospitals in appreciation of the necessity for unexpected audit findings to stimulate action. CONCLUSION: Major trauma audit measures trauma patient care processes and outcomes of care to drive quality improvement at hospital and national level. MTA will facilitate the strategic development of trauma care in Ireland by monitoring processes and outcomes and the effects of changes in trauma service provision.",

        "abstract": "Spiders are abundant in tropical ecosystems and exert predatory pressure on a wide variety of invertebrate populations and also serve as prey for many others organisms, being part of complex interrelationships influenced directly and indirectly by a myriad of factors. We examined the influence of biotic (i.e., prey availability) and abiotic (i.e., temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, real evapotranspiration) factors on species richness and abundance during a two-year period in the semiarid Caatinga vegetation in northeastern Brazil. Data were analyzed through partial autocorrelation functions, cross correlations, and a path analysis. A total of 2522 spiders were collected with beating tray, pit-fall traps, and malaise traps, comprising 91 species and 34 families. Spider abundance peaked in the rainy season. Our results suggest that total invertebrate abundance has a direct influence on spider richness and abundance, whereas the effects of precipitation were mainly indirectly related to most spider assemblage parameters. The increase in vegetation cover with the rainy season in the Caatinga provides more breeding and foraging sites for spiders and stimulates their activities. Additionally, rainfall in arid and semiarid ecosystems stimulated the activity and reproduction of many herbivore and detritivore invertebrates dependent on plant biomass and necromass consumption, leading to an increase in spider prey availability.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Renal transplantation is the best choice for the treatment of dialysis patients with end-stage renal failure because it provides better quality of life and more life time. However, despite successful surgical techniques, immunological issues in kidney transplantation are not completely resolved. Thus, after transplantation, patients must be followed up closely. Although patient follow-up with the use of creatinine and renal biopsy are common, it is thought that biopsy is too invasive and that creatinine is unreliable. Hence, new parameters that correlate with the patient's immunological condition are needed in clinical monitoring. METHODS: One of the biomarkers that has been studied recently is neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Its diagnostic value in cases of acute renal failure, delayed graft function, and IgA nephropathy is widely investigated. However, data are insufficient as to whether NGAL can be used for follow-up in the chronic process after renal transplantation. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of NGAL in terms of rejection in donor-specific antibody (DSA)-positive and DSA-negative renal transplant patients. Ninety patients were included. RESULTS: We found that rejection rates were higher in patients whose NGAL values were >/= 50 and DSA-positive. Delayed graft function was seen more frequently in patients whose NGAL values were >/= 50. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in NGAL level does not always indicate renal injury because NGAL is also an acute-phase reactant. NGAL cannot be used alone to diagnose rejection, but, if NGAL level is high, it is necessary to study DSA, and sub-clinical rejection must be researched.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that iron induces the endocytosis of the iron transporter dimetal transporter 1 (DMT1) during intestinal absorption. We, and others, have proposed that iron-induced DMT1 internalization underlies the mucosal block phenomena, a regulatory response that downregulates intestinal iron uptake after a large oral dose of iron. In this work, we investigated the participation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the establishment of this response. By means of selective surface protein biotinylation of polarized Caco-2 cells, we determined the kinetics of DMT1 internalization from the apical membrane after an iron challenge. The initial decrease in DMT1 levels in the apical membrane induced by iron was followed at later times by increased levels of DMT1. Addition of Fe(2+), but not of Cd(2+), Zn(2+), Cu(2+), or Cu(1+), induced the production of intracellular ROS, as detected by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. Preincubation with the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) resulted in increased DMT1 at the apical membrane before and after addition of iron. Similarly, preincubation with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) resulted in the enhanced presence of DMT1 at the apical membrane. The decrease of DMT1 levels at the apical membrane induced by iron was associated with decreased iron uptake rates. A kinetic mathematical model based on operational rate constants of DMT1 endocytosis and exocytosis is proposed. The model qualitatively captures the experimental observations and accurately describes the effect of iron, NAC, and DMSO on the apical distribution of DMT1. Taken together, our data suggest that iron uptake induces the production of ROS, which modify DMT1 endocytic cycling, thus changing the iron transport activity at the apical membrane.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed to assess the reliability of G8 as a screening tool and to determine the predictive value of CGA items in terms of 1-year overall survival (OS). G8 and CGA were proposed to 107 consecutive patients (65-89 years) with hematological malignancies assessed by their physicians as clinically fit, meaning not exhibiting geriatric syndromes and/or irreversible comorbidities significantly impairing their daily function, and thus able to receive chemotherapy. RESULTS: Out of 107 patients, 90 patients were evaluable and completed both scales; 72% and 80% were defined as \"vulnerable\" when evaluated with G8 (</= 14.5) or CGA (>/= 2 impairments) respectively. The area under ROC-curve of G8 compared to CGA was 0.749+/-0.051. Neither G8 nor CGA total scores were predictive of 1-year OS. However, age (HR=1.105, 95% CI: 1.016-1.202; p=0.019), diagnosis (HR=5.208, 95% CI: 1.895-14.310; p=0.001) and cognitive status (HR=3.260, 95% CI: 1.043-10.194; p=0.042) were predictive of OS. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in our selected hematological patients: 1) the G8 score does not help selecting patients for CGA, 2) the G8 and CGA total scores do not predict OS, and 3) in addition to the age and disease itself, cognitive impairment appears to be a powerful prognostic factor.",

Previous research found that Colombian women perceived IPV to increase after displacement. This study explored how the experience of displacement altered gendered roles in ways that influenced the risk of IPV. Thirty-three qualitative interviews were conducted with displaced partnered Colombian women. Women disclosed that couples often held patriarchal gender norms; however, the roles of each partner necessitated by conditions of displacement were often in conflict with these norms. Men's underemployment and women's employment outside the home were viewed as gender transgressive within some partnerships and increased relationship conflict. Economic resources intended to empower displaced women, notably women's earnings and home ownership, had unintended negative consequences for women's agency. These consequences included a corresponding decrease in partner financial contributions and reduced mobility. Women's ability to obtain support or leave violent relationships was hindered by interpersonal, social and structural barriers. For women to have agency to leave violent relationships, power relationships at all levels from the interpersonal to societal must be recognised and addressed.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of the late phase diabetes, and also a common cause of blindness. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) is considered to be an inflammatory mediator in the late phase that promotes inflammation and neovascularization in diabetes. Therefore, this paper discussed the role of HMGB-1 in diabetic retinopathy inflammation and neovascularization. 96 adult SD rats were randomly divided into control and diabetes group. The diabetic rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of streptomycin (0.1 mol/L). Western blot was applied to determine HMGB-1 and its receptor RAGE and TLR2 protein expression in the serum. TUNEL was used to detect retinal apoptosis. Immunofluorescence was performed to test HMGB1 protein expression in retina. HBGM-1 and RAGE expression in diabetic rat retina was significantly higher than the control (P < 0.05), while TLR2 expression was lower (P < 0.05). TUNEL detection showed that diabetic rat retinal cells presented obviously higher apoptosis rate (P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence test revealed that HMGB1 largely expressed in the diabetic rat retinal cells (P < 0.05). HMGB1 may involve in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy by binding with RAGE receptor to accelerate rat retinal cells apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 5-yr prevalence and incidence rates of cardiovascular medication and cardiovascular disease before and after onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children and adolescents. METHODS: Children and adolescents (<19 yr) with T1D (n = 925), defined as those who received at least two insulin prescriptions, and a four times larger reference cohort (n = 3591) with the same age and gender in the Dutch PHARMO Record Linkage System (RLS) were studied in a retrospective cohort study between 1999 and 2009. The date of first insulin dispensing was selected as the index date. RESULTS: The overall prevalence rate of cardiovascular medication use was substantially higher in the T1D cohort before (2.2 vs. 1.0%, p < 0.001) and after (9.2 vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001) the index date. After the index date angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (2.0%) and statins (1.5%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular medications in the T1D cohort. The highest incidence rate of cardiovascular medication use was observed in the first year after the index date [28.1 per 1000 person years (PY)]. Furthermore, three type 1 diabetic patients were hospitalized due to cardiomyopathy (n = 2) and heart failure (n = 1) and one child from the reference group was hospitalized due to cardiomyopathy in the 5 yr after the index date. CONCLUSIONS: Children with T1D were more likely to use cardiovascular medications in the years before and after the onset of diabetes. Our study emphasizes the importance of routine screening tests and timely treatment of CVD risk factors in the pediatric population with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "In accordance with international targets, the Uganda National Malaria Control Strategic Plan established specific targets to be achieved by 2010. For children under five, this included increasing the number of children sleeping under mosquito nets and those receiving a first-line antimalarial to 85%, and decreasing case fatality to 2%. This narrative review offers contextual information relevant to malaria management in Uganda since the advent of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) as first-line antimalarial treatment in 2004. A comprehensive search using key words and phrases was conducted using the web search engines Google and Google Scholar, as well as the databases of PubMed, ERIC, EMBASE, CINAHL, OvidSP (MEDLINE), PSYC Info, Springer Link, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. A total of 147 relevant international and Ugandan literature sources meeting the inclusion criteria were included. This review provides an insightful understanding on six topic areas: global and local priorities, malarial pathology, disease burden, malaria control, treatment guidelines for uncomplicated malaria, and role of the health system in accessing antimalarial medicines. Plasmodium falciparum remains the most common cause of malaria in Uganda, with children under five being most vulnerable due to their underdeveloped immunity. While international efforts to scale up malaria control measures have resulted in considerable decline in malaria incidence and mortality in several regions of sub-Saharan Africa, this benefit has yet to be substantiated for Uganda. At the local level, key initiatives have included implementation of a new antimalarial drug policy in 2004 and strengthening of government health systems and programs. Examples of such programs include removal of user fees, training of frontline health workers, providing free ACT from government systems and subsidized ACT from licensed private outlets, and introduction of the integrated community case management program to bring diagnostics and treatment for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea closer to the community. However despite notable efforts, Uganda is far from achieving its 2010 targets. Several challenges in the delivery of care and treatment remain, with those most vulnerable and living in rural settings remaining at greatest risk from malaria morbidity and mortality.",

The local tumour spread (T), presence of metastases in regional lymph nodes (N) and distant organs (M), tumour grade (G) and resection line status (R) by pathology findings (pTNMGR), mitotic activity, perineural, vascular and lymphatic invasion were assessed in 16 surgically resected PNENs. By immunohistochemistry, expression of Ki-67, p53, p27, p21, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, E-cadherin, CD44, vimentin, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), microvascular density, and cytokeratin (CK) spectrum, along with neuroendocrine, intestinal and squamous markers were detected. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Spearman's rank correlation, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis methods were applied; p<0.05 was considered significant. Ki-67, CK19, p63, vimentin and COX-2 were significantly up-regulated in PNENs in comparison to benign pancreatic islets. A complex network of morphological and molecular associations was identified. Ki-67 correlated with PNEN size (p=0.022), the World Health Organization 2004 and 2010 classification grades (p=0.021 and p=0.002), stage (p=0.028) and mitotic count (p=0.007) but among molecular markers--with CK19 (p=0.033) and vimentin (p=0.045). CK19 was significantly up-regulated in PNENs, having higher pT (p=0.018), pR (p=0.025), vascular (p=0.020), perineural (p=0.026) and lymphatic invasion (p=0.043). In conclusion, proliferation activity (by Ki-67), E-cadherin, vimentin and CK19 are important molecular characteristics of PNENs due to significant associations with morphological tumour characteristics, pTNMGR and invasive growth.",

METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis by searching PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for English-language literature from inception to 1 October 2014. Studies assessing the relationship between excessive gestational weight gain and macrosomia were included. Characteristics including study design, country, sample size, definition of macrosomia, adjusted odds ratios, CIs and adjustment factors were extracted independently by two reviewers. Summary odds ratios were calculated by using a random-effects model meta-analysis. RESULTS: 15 relevant articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. Incorporated by random-effect model before the heterogeneity tests, the value of OR was 2.35 (95 % CI: 1.95, 2.85). Stratified analysis showed no differences regarding different study design, definition of macrosomia and location of study. There was no indication of a publication bias either from the result of Egger's test (P = 0.572) or Begg's test (P = 0.572). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicated that excessive gestational weight gain might increase the risk of macrosomia.",

Beyond these established patterns of MRI findings, there are many confounders and contributing pathologies about the pelvis in patients with activity related groin pain, including internal and periarticular derangements of the hip. The MRI is ideally suited to delineate the extent of expected injury and to identify the unexpected visceral and musculoskeletal lesions.",

The leptomeninges, which comprise the arachnoid and pia, have many functions beyond brain protection including roles in neurogenesis, fibrotic scar formation and brain inflammation. Similarly, the choroid plexus plays important roles in normal brain function but is also involved in brain inflammation. We have begun studying the role of human leptomeninges and choroid plexus in brain inflammation and leptomeninges in fibrotic scar formation, using human brain derived explant cultures. To study the composition of the cells generated in these explants we undertook immunocytochemical characterisation. Cells, mainly pericytes and meningeal macrophages, emerge from leptomeningeal explants (LME's) and respond to inflammatory mediators by producing inflammatory molecules. LME-derived cells also respond to mechanical injury and cytokines, providing an in vitro human brain model of fibrotic scar formation. Choroid plexus explants (CPE's) generate epithelial cells, pericytes and microglia/macrophages. CPE-derived cells also respond to inflammatory mediators. LME and CPE explants survive and generate cells for many months in vitro and provide a remarkable opportunity to study basic mechanisms of human brain inflammation and fibrosis and to test human-active anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring treatments.",

Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that this strain belongs to the genus Paracoccus. Strain 43P(T) contained Q-10 as the sole isoprenoid quinone. The major cellular fatty acids were C(18)(: 1)omega7c or C(18)(: 1)omega6c and C(16)(: 0), and C(18)(: 0), C(18)(: 1)omega9c, C(10)(: 0) 3-OH and summed feature 2 were detected as minor components. The DNA G+C content of strain 43P(T) was 64.1 mol%. Strain 43P(T) contained the major polar lipids phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unknown aminolipid and two unknown glycolipids. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain 43P(T) and the six related type strains of the genus Paracoccus, including P. limosus, was below 23 %. Based on the chemotaxonomic and physiological data and the values of DNA-DNA relatedness, especially the ability to assimilate l-glucose, this strain should be classified as a representative of a novel species of the genus Paracoccus, for which the name Paracoccus laeviglucosivorans sp. nov.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate, the existence of a signature of differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) during osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs from OA and healthy donors and to describe their possible implication in joint regeneration through modulation of molecular mechanisms involved in homeostatic control in OA pathophysiology. METHODS: Following phenotypic assessment of BM-MSCs obtained from OA diagnosed patients (n = 10) and non-OA (n = 10), total small RNA was isolated after osteogenic induction for 1, 10 and 21 days, miRNA profiles were generated using a commercial expression array of 754 well-characterized miRNAs. MiRNAs, with consistent differential expression were selected for further validation by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 246 miRNAs were differentially expressed (fold change >/= +/- 2, P </=0.05) between OA and non-OA BM-MSC samples; these miRNAs showed variable interactions depending on the cell and differentiation status. Two miRNAs, hsa-miR-210 and hsa-miR-335-5p out of 21 used for validation showed a significant downregulated expression during induced osteogenesis. In particular hsa-miR-335-5p, a critical regulator in bone homeostasis, was further studied. hsa-miR-335-5p downregulation in OA-MSCs, as well as their host coding gene, MEST, were also assessed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive assessment to date of miRNA expression profiling in BM-MSCs from OA patients and their role during osteogenic differentiation. We describe the existence of a correlation between miR-335-5p expression and OA indicating the putative role of this miRNA in OA features. These findings, may contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in MSCs mediated homeostatic control in OA pathophysiology that could be applicable in future therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes are superior in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) compared to open prostatectomy (ORP). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed records from men who received ORP or RARP at our institution between January 2009 and December 2012. Patients completed a demographics questionnaire and the Patient-Oriented Prostate Utility Scale (PORPUS), a validated disease-specific HRQoL instrument prior to surgery and every 3 months up to 15 months after surgery. RESULTS: In total, 974 men met the inclusion criteria (643 ORP and 331 RARP patients). At baseline, RARP patients were significantly younger (p < 0.001), had lower body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), lower preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (p < 0.001), fewer comorbidities (p < 0.004), and higher baseline PORPUS scores (p = 0.024). On follow-up, unadjusted PORPUS scores were significantly higher in the RARP group at each point. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, ORP versus RARP procedure, Gleason score, BMI, first PSA, comorbidity, ethnicity, and baseline PORPUS scores, PORPUS score was higher for the RARP group at 3 months (p = 0.038) and 9 months (p = 0.037), but not at 6, 12, and 15 months (p = 0.014). No difference met pre-defined thresholds of clinical significant. CONCLUSIONS: Though unadjusted HRQoL outcomes appeared improved with RARP compared to ORP differences, adjusted differences were seen at only 2 of 5 postoperative time points, and did not meet pre-defined thresholds of clinical significance. Further randomized trials are needed to assess whether one treatment option provides consistently better HRQoL outcomes.",

Particularly in case of mutations and/or insufficient chaperoning, these can aggregate and become toxic within or amongst cells. Immunoglobulins (Ig) are no exception. In the extracellular space, certain Ig-L chains form fibrils causing systemic amyloidosis. On the other hand, Ig variants lacking the first constant domain condense in dilated cisternae of the early secretory compartment, called Russell Bodies (RB), frequently observed in plasma cell dyscrasias, autoimmune diseases and chronic infections. RB biogenesis can be recapitulated in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells by expressing mutant Ig-mu, providing powerful models to investigate the pathophysiology of endoplasmic reticulum storage disorders. Here we analyze the aggregation propensity and the biochemical features of the intra- and extra-cellular Ig deposits in human cells, revealing beta-aggregated features for RB.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy has recently been redefined to include a single unprovoked seizure if the probability of recurrence is >/=60% over the following 10 years. This definition is based on the estimated risk of a third seizure after two unprovoked seizures, using the lower-limit 95% confidence interval (CI) at 4 years, and does not account for the initially high recurrence rate after first-ever seizure that rapidly falls with increasing duration of seizure freedom. We analyzed long-term outcomes after the first-ever seizure, and the influence of duration of seizure freedom on the likelihood of seizure recurrence, and their relevance to the new definition of epilepsy. METHODS: Prospective analysis of 798 adults with a first-ever unprovoked seizure seen at a hospital-based first seizure clinic between 2000 and 2011. The likelihood of seizure recurrence was analyzed according to the duration of seizure freedom, etiology, electroencephalography (EEG), and neuroimaging findings. RESULTS: The likelihood of seizure recurrence at 10 years was >/=60% in patients with epileptiform abnormalities on EEG or neuroimaging abnormalities, therefore, meeting the new definition of epilepsy. However, the risk of recurrence was highly time dependent; after a brief period (</=12 weeks) of seizure freedom, no patient group continued to fulfill the new definition of epilepsy. Of 407 patients who had a second seizure, the likelihood of a third seizure at 4 years was 68% (95% CI 63-73%) and at 10 years was 85% (95% CI 79-91%). SIGNIFICANCE: The duration of seizure freedom following first-ever seizure substantially influences the risk of recurrence, with none of our patients fulfilling the new definition of epilepsy after a short period of seizure freedom. When a threshold was applied based on the 10-year risk of a third seizure from our data, no first-seizure patient group ever had epilepsy. These data may be utilized in a definition of epilepsy after a first-ever seizure.",

        "abstract": "Aplastic anemia (AAI) is a rare life-threatening disorder which is characterized by bi- or tricytopenia and hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow. AA can present as an acquired or congenital disorder. In recent years it was noted that a subgroup of patients with seemingly acquired AA with onset in adulthood carry mutations which cause or at least predispose to bone marrow failure, e.g. mutations in the genes of the telomerase complex. Options for first-line treatment are allogeneic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppression. The decision depends on severity of the disease, age and comorbidity of the patient and availability of a matched stem cell donor. Probability of survival after HLA-identical sibling transplantation exceeds 90% in young patients with bone marrow as the stem cell source and conditioning with an ATG-containing regimen. Results of matched unrelated donor transplantation have improved substantially over the last 10 years. Matched unrelated donor transplantation is increasingly considered as the first-line treatment for very young patients who are candidates for transplantation, but lack an HLA-identical sibling donor. The gold standard for immunosuppression is the combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CsA). ATG, a polyvalent antibody preparation, is obtained from animals after immunization with human thymocytes. Response rate and overall survival after horse ATG treatment are significantly higher compared to rabbit ATG. Recent trials reported a surprisingly high rate of bi- and trilinear response to treatment with the thrombopoietin receptor agonist eltrombopag in patients refractory to immunosuppression. Ongoing trials now address the potential role of eltrombopag as an adjunct to immunosuppression in first-line treatment.",

The aim of this research was to compare the quality of life of patients with lower extremity amputation and people without amputation taking into account gender differences as well as the amputation level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was designed as a cross-sectional study which included 56 subjects. The patients from the experimental group underwent prosthetic rehabilitation treatment at the Department of Medical Rehabilitation, Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The experimental group included 28 patients (21 male, 7 female) with lower extremity amputation, their average age being 65.36+/-13.64. The control group consisted of 28 age and gender matching subjects without amputation. Research ANd Development (RAND) 36--Item Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36) was used to measure the quality of life. RESULTS: The results showed that patients with lower extremity amputation scored lower than the control group on all SF-36 variables (p<0.05). None of the SF-36 variables differed between the genders (p>0.05). Seventeen (61%) patients were with transfemoral, and 11 (39%) with transtibial level of amputation. The patients with transtibial amputations scored higher on physical functioning and general health status variables (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The patients with lower extremity amputations have numerous limitations compared to the control group, regardless of gender, while the patients with lower level of amputation have a higher level of physical functioning.",

We also demonstrate a method for making stronger causal inferences when assessing mediation in the presence of moderation and time-varying confounding. METHODS: We estimate a series of inverse propensity weighted models to obtain unbiased estimates of mediation in the presence of confounding of the exposure (i.e., gang membership) and mediator (i.e., anticipated guilt) using three waves of data from a multi-site panel study of a law-related education program for youth (N=1,113). RESULTS: The onset of gang membership significantly decreased anticipated substance use guilt among both male and female respondents. This reduction was significantly associated with increased frequency of substance use only for female respondents, however, suggesting that gender moderates the mechanism through which gang membership influences substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Criminologists are often concerned with identifying causal pathways for antisocial and/or delinquent behavior, but confounders of the exposure, mediator, and outcome often interfere with efforts to assess mediation. Many new approaches have been proposed for strengthening causal inference for mediation effects. After controlling for confounding using inverse propensity weighting, our results suggest that interventions aimed at reducing substance use by current and former female gang members should focus on the normative aspects of these behaviors.",

The aim of this study was to determine if G-CSF could treat DN in an animal model and to ascertain its mechanism of action. In a rodent model of DN, G-CSF dramatically recovered nerve function, retarded histological nerve changes and increased the expression of neurotrophic factors within nerve. A sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT) study revealed that G-CSF treatment increased the abundance of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells in nerves damaged by DN. However, we did not observe evidence of transdifferentiation or cell fusion of BM-derived cells. The beneficial effects of G-CSF were dependent on the integrity of BM. In conclusion, G-CSF produced a therapeutic effect in a rodent model of DN, which was attributed, at least in part, to the actions of BM-derived cells.",

METHODS: Data from a study of adults randomly selected from the membership list of the Mood Disorder Association of British Columbia (n = 97), Canada, were analyzed. Food insecurity status was based on validated screening questions asking if in the past 12 months did the participant, due to a lack of money, worry about or not have enough food to eat. Nutrient intakes were derived from 3-day food records and compared to the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Psychological functioning measures included Global Assessment of Functioning, Hamilton Depression scale, and Young Mania Rating Scale. Using binomial tests of two proportions, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Poisson regression we examined: (1) food insecurity prevalence between the study respondents and a general population sample from the British Columbia Nutrition Survey (BCNS; n = 1,823); (2) differences in nutrient intakes based on food insecurity status; and (3) associations of food insecurity and psychological functioning using bivariate and Poisson regression statistics. RESULTS: In comparison to the general population (BCNS), food insecurity was significantly more prevalent in the adults with mood disorders (7.3% in BCNS vs 36.1%; p < 0.001). Respondents who were food-insecure had lower median intakes of carbohydrates and vitamin C (p < 0.05). In addition, a higher proportion of those reporting food insecurity had protein, folate, and zinc intakes below the DRI benchmark of potential inadequacy (p < 0.05). There was significant association between food insecurity and mania symptoms (adjusted prevalence ratio = 2.37, 95% CI 1.49-3.75, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity is associated with both nutritional and psychological health in adults with mood disorders. Investigation of interventions aimed at food security and income can help establish its role in enhancing mental health.",

Some small noncontrolled studies evaluated the effect of sertraline on IDH with conflicting results. This study is a randomized crossover controlled trial on the effectiveness of sertraline to reduce IDH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients on hemodialysis who suffered IDH in at least 50% of their dialysis sessions were enrolled. Each patient received either sertraline or placebo for 4 weeks and after a 4-week washout period, was switched to the other arm of the trial. All patients started sertraline at a daily dose of 50 mg that increased to 100 mg after 1 week. RESULTS: Twelve patients completed all phases of the study. Sertraline therapy increased nadir intradialysis diastolic and systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg and 4.9 mm Hg at the end of the intervention, respectively. Sertraline therapy also significantly increased postdialysis diastolic and systolic blood pressure by 6.0 mm Hg and 8.7 mm Hg. Sertraline therapy significantly reduced the risk of hypotension episodes by 43%. The improvement of intradialysis and postdialysis diastolic and systolic blood pressure were only significant in nondiabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sertraline therapy significantly increases intradialysis and postdialysis blood pressure. These effects of sertraline can result in significant decrease in hypotension episodes during dialysis treatment and the number of interventions required to manage IDH. However, not all patients may benefit from sertraline depending on comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces morbidity and mortality in heart failure. However, prediction of the outcome remains difficult. We aimed to investigate for echocardiographic predictors of ventricular arrhythmias and fatal outcome and to explore how myocardial function is changed by biventricular pacing in heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively included 170 heart failure patients (66 +/- 10 years, New York Heart Association class 2.8 +/- 0.5, 48% ischaemic cardiomyopathy) and recorded ventricular arrhythmias and fatal end point defined as death, heart transplantation, or left ventricular assist device implantation during 2 years. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before and 6 months after CRT implantation. CRT response was defined as >/=15% reduction in end-systolic volume at 6 months. Speckle-tracking technique was performed to assess longitudinal and circumferential left ventricular function, defined as global longitudinal (GLS) and circumferential strain (GCS), and to assess mechanical dyssynchrony, defined as mechanical dispersion. GLS before CRT was a predictor of fatal end point independently of CRT response [hazard ratio, HR 1.14 (1.02-1.27), P = 0.02]. Patients with GLS better than -8.3% showed event-free survival benefit (log rank, P < 0.001). Mechanical dispersion at 6 months was an independent predictor of ventricular arrhythmias [HR 1.20 (1.06-1.35), P = 0.005]. CRT responders (59%) had improvement of both GLS and GCS. CONCLUSION: In heart failure patients with CRT, worse longitudinal function before CRT was an important predictor of fatal outcome during 2 years, independently of CRT response. Mechanical dispersion at 6 months was a strong predictor of ventricular arrhythmias. CRT response by reverse remodelling was dependent on improvement of both longitudinal and circumferential function.",

Then, this paper shall examine the national informatics infrastructure initiatives in the four respective countries that support the Traditional Medicine systems. Challenges of implementing informatics in Traditional Medicine Systems shall also be discussed. METHODS: The literature was sourced from four databases: Ebsco Host, IEEE Explore, Proquest and Google scholar. The search term used was \"Traditional Medicine\", \"informatics\", \"informatics infrastructure\", \"traditional Chinese medicine\", \"Ayurveda\", \"traditional Arabic and Islamic medicine\", and \"traditional malay medicine\". A combination of the search terms above was also executed to enhance the searching process. A search was also conducted in Google to identify miscellaneous books, publications, and organization websites using the same terms. RESULTS: Amongst major advancements in TCM and Ayurveda are bioinformatics, development of Traditional Medicine databases for decision system support, data mining and image processing. Traditional Chinese Medicine differentiates itself from other Traditional Medicine systems with documented ISO Standards to support the standardization of TCM. Informatics applications in Traditional Arabic and Islamic Medicine are mostly ehealth applications that focus more on spiritual healing, Islamic obligations and prophetic traditions. Literature regarding development of health informatics to support Traditional Malay Medicine is still insufficient. Major informatics infrastructure that is common in China and India are automated insurance payment systems for Traditional Medicine treatment. National informatics infrastructure in Middle East and Malaysia mainly cater for modern medicine. Other infrastructure such as telemedicine and hospital information systems focus its implementation in modern medicine or are not implemented and strategized at a national level to support Traditional Medicine. CONCLUSION: Informatics may not be able to address all the emerging areas of Traditional Medicine because the concepts in Traditional Medicine system of medicine are different from modern system, though the aim may be same, i.e., to give relief to the patient. Thus, there is a need to synthesize Traditional Medicine systems and informatics with involvements from modern system of medicine. Future research works may include filling the gaps of informatics areas and integrate national informatics infrastructure with established Traditional Medicine systems.",

Insulin/IGF signalling is the primary regulator of animal body growth, but the extent to which miRNAs act in insulin-producing cells (IPCs) is unclear. Here we generate a UAS-miRNA library of Drosophila stocks and perform a genetic screen to identify miRNAs whose overexpression in the IPCs inhibits body growth in Drosophila. Through this screen, we identify miR-9a as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of insulin signalling and body growth. IPC-specific miR-9a overexpression reduces insulin signalling and body size. Of the predicted targets of miR-9a, we find that loss of miR-9a enhances the level of sNPFR1. We show via an in vitro binding assay that miR-9a binds to sNPFR1 mRNA in insect cells and to the mammalian orthologue NPY2R in rat insulinoma cells. These findings indicate that the conserved miR-9a regulates body growth by controlling sNPFR1/NPYR-mediated modulation of insulin signalling.",

Spectrally-encoded confocal microscopy (SECM) is a high-speed reflectance confocal microscopy technology that has the potential to overcome sampling error by imaging large regions of gastrointestinal tract tissues. The aim of this study was to test a recently developed SECM endoscopic probe for comprehensively imaging large segments of the esophagus at the microscopic level in vivo. METHODS: Topical acetic acid was endoscopically applied to the esophagus of a normal living swine. The 7 mm diameter SECM endoscopic probe was transorally introduced into the esophagus over a wire. Optics within the SECM probe were helically scanned over a 5 cm length of the esophagus. Confocal microscopy data was displayed and stored in real time. RESULTS: Very large confocal microscopy images (length = 5 cm; circumference = 2.2 cm) of swine esophagus from three imaging depths, spanning a total area of 33 cm(2), were obtained in about 2 minutes. SECM images enabled the visualization of cellular morphology of the swine esophagus, including stratified squamous cell nuclei, basal cells, and collagen within the lamina propria. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that the SECM technology can rapidly provide large, contiguous confocal microscopy images of the esophagus in vivo. When applied to human subjects, the unique comprehensive, microscopic imaging capabilities of this technology may be utilized for improving the screening and surveillance of various esophageal diseases.",

Upon further lithiation, LiRuO2 formed by intercalation decomposes to nanosized Ru metal and Li2 O by a conversion reaction. A reversible capacity in addition to its theoretical capacity is observed on discharging below 0.5 V during which no redox activity involving Ru is observed. TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique are used to probe this additional capacity. The results show that the additional capacity is a result of Li storage in the grain boundary between nanosized Ru metal and Li2 O.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Indian agriculture is an economic symbiosis of crop and livestock production with cattle as the foundation. Sadly, the population of indigenous cattle (Bos indicus) is declining (8.94% in last decade) and needs immediate scientific management. Genetic characterization is the first step in the development of proper management strategies for preserving genetic diversity and preventing undesirable loss of alleles. Thus, in this study we investigated genetic diversity and relationship among eleven Indian cattle breeds using 21 microsatellite markers and mitochondrial D loop sequence. RESULTS: The analysis of autosomal DNA was performed on 508 cattle which exhibited sufficient genetic diversity across all the breeds. Estimates of mean allele number and observed heterozygosity across all loci and population were 8.784 +/- 0.25 and 0.653 +/- 0.014, respectively. Differences among breeds accounted for 13.3% of total genetic variability. Despite high genetic diversity, significant inbreeding was also observed within eight populations. Genetic distances and cluster analysis showed a close relationship between breeds according to proximity in geographic distribution. The genetic distance, STRUCTURE and Principal Coordinate Analysis concluded that the Southern Indian Ongole cattle are the most distinct among the investigated cattle populations. Sequencing of hypervariable mitochondrial DNA region on a subset of 170 cattle revealed sixty haplotypes with haplotypic diversity of 0.90240, nucleotide diversity of 0.02688 and average number of nucleotide differences as 6.07407. Two major star clusters for haplotypes indicated population expansion for Indian cattle. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes show a similar pattern of genetic variability and genetic differentiation. Various analyses concluded that the Southern breed 'Ongole' was distinct from breeds of Northern/ Central India. Overall these results provide basic information about genetic diversity and structure of Indian cattle which should have implications for management and conservation of indicine cattle diversity.",

Many predict the emergence of personalized medicine in the near future. We are, however, moving from two-tiered health systems to a two-tiered personalized medicine. Omics facilities are restricted to affluent regions, and personalized medicine is likely to widen the growing gap in health systems between high and low-income countries. This is mirrored by an increasing lag between our ability to generate and analyze big data. Several bottlenecks slow-down the transition from conventional to personalized medicine: generation of cost-effective high-throughput data; hybrid education and multidisciplinary teams; data storage and processing; data integration and interpretation; and individual and global economic relevance. This review provides an update of important developments in the analysis of big data and forward strategies to accelerate the global transition to personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Naming deficit is a linguistic symptom that appears in the initial phase of Alzheimer's disease, but the types of naming errors and the ways in which this deficit changes over the course of the disease are unclear. We analyzed the performance of patients with Alzheimer's disease on naming tasks during the mild and moderate phases and verified how this linguistic skill deteriorates over the course of the disease. METHODS: A reduced version of the Boston Naming Test was administered to 30 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, 30 patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease and 30 healthy controls. Errors were classified as verbal semantic paraphasia, verbal phonemic paraphasia, no response (pure anomia), circumlocution, unrelated verbal paraphasia, visual errors or intrusion errors. RESULTS: The patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease had significantly fewer correct answers than did both the control group and the group with mild Alzheimer's disease. With regard to the pattern of errors, verbal semantic paraphasia errors were the most frequent errors in all three groups. Additionally, as the disease severity increased, there was an increase in the number of no-response errors (pure anomia). The group with moderate Alzheimer's disease demonstrated a greater incidence of visual errors and unrelated verbal paraphasias compared with the other two groups and presented a more variable pattern of errors. CONCLUSIONS: Performance on nominative tasks worsened as the disease progressed in terms of both the quantity and the type of errors encountered. This result reflects impairment at different levels of linguistic processing.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D for musculoskeletal health, including osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this prospective cohort study was to determine whether serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations were associated with the risk of hip arthroplasty for OA. DESIGN: This study examined 9135 participants from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study who had serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D measured in 1999-2000 and were aged >/=40 years at the commencement of arthroplasty data collection. The incidence of hip arthroplasty for OA during 2002-2011 was determined by linking cohort records to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. RESULTS: Over an average 9.1 (standard deviation (SD) 2.7) years of follow-up, 201 hip arthroplasties for OA were identified (males n = 90; females n = 111). In males, a one-standard-deviation increase in 25-hydroxy-vitamin D was associated with a 25% increased incidence (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.56), with a dose response relationship evident by quartiles of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration (P for trend 0.04). These results were independent of age, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, smoking status, physical activity, season of blood collection, latitude, hypertension and diabetes, area level disadvantage or after excluding those with extreme low 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations. No significant association was observed in women (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87, 1.39). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations were associated with an increased risk of hip arthroplasty for OA in males, while no significant association was observed in females. The mechanism for the association warrants further investigation.",

Not much is known about survival of patients on ART in slums. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with mortality among adult patients on ART in resource poor, urban, sub-Saharan African setting. A prospective open cohort study was conducted with adult patients on ART at a clinic in Kibera slums, Nairobi, Kenya. The patients' enrollment to care was between March 2005 and November 2011. Descriptive statistics were computed and Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods used to estimate survival time while Cox's proportional hazards (CPH) model fitted to determine mortality predictors. A total of 2,011 adult patients were studied, 69% being female. Female gender (p=0.0016), zidovudine-based regimen patients (p<0.0001), CD4 count>351 patients (p<0.0001), WHO stage I patients (p<0.0001) and \"Working\" functional status patients recorded better survival probability on ART. In CPH analysis, the hazard of dying was higher in patients on Stavudine-based regimen(hazard ratio (HR)=.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2; p<0.0001),CD4 count<50 cells/microl (HR=1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.7;p<0.0001), WHO Stage IV at ART initiation (HR=1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6; p=0.016) and bedridden patients (HR=2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.4;p<0.0001). There was increased mortality among the males, those with advanced Immunosuppression, late WHO stage and bedridden patients. The findings further justify the need to switch patients on Stavudine-based regimen as per the WHO recommendations.",

Most, but not all, clinical trials report a modest short- but not long-term benefit of infusing bone marrow-derived cells. Effect size appears to correlate with stringency of study-design: the most stringent trials report the smallest effect-sizes. We conclude there may be short- but not substantial long-term benefit of infusing bone marrow-derived cells into persons with chronic heart failure and any benefit observed is unlikely to result from trans-differentiation of bone marrow-derived cells into functioning cardiomyocytes.",

        "abstract": "Phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) and natural organic matter (NOM) naturally occur in all aquatic ecosystems. However, excessive P loads can cause eutrophic or hyper-eutrophic conditions in these waters. As a result, P regulation is important for these impaired aquatic systems, and Ca-P co-precipitation is a vital mechanism of natural P removal in many alkaline systems, such as the Florida Everglades. The interaction of P, Ca, and NOM is also an important factor in lime softening and corrosion control, both critical processes of drinking water treatment. Determining the role of NOM in Ca-P co-precipitation is important for identifying mechanisms that may limit P removal in both natural and engineered systems. The main goal of this research is to assess the role of NOM in inhibiting Ca and P co-precipitation by: (1) measuring how Ca, NOM, and P concentrations affect NOM's potential inhibition of co-precipitation; (2) determining the effect of pH; and (3) evaluating the precipitated solids. Results showed that Ca-P co-precipitation occurs at pH 9.5 in the presence of high natural organic matter (NOM) ( approximately 30 mg L(-1)). The supersaturation of calcite overcomes the inhibitory effect of NOM seen at lower pH values. Higher initial P concentrations lead to both higher P precipitation rates and densities of P on the calcite surface. The maximum surface density of co-precipitated P on the precipitated calcite surface increases with increasing NOM levels, suggesting that NOM does prevent the co-precipitation of Ca and P.",

We analyzed the patterns of cancer relapse after partial hepatectomy to guide post-operative management. METHODS: A total of 144 HCC patients (1996-2011) after partial hepatectomy were reviewed. Statistical correlations were determined using univariate and partition analyses. RESULTS: A median follow-up of 20 months showed recurrence in 71 (49%) patients, and the median time to recurrence was 11.9 months. Vascular invasion (P<0.01) and number of lesions (P<0.01) predicted for recurrence. Histologic grade was not correlated with recurrence. Twenty-two (31%) patients developed both surgical margin (SM) and concurrent intrahepatic recurrences, and 28 (40%) had non-SM intrahepatic recurrences with no other signs of recurrence. On partition analysis, the risk of marginal recurrence in patients with SM <1 mm and SM >/=1 mm was 35% and 13.5% respectively. Approximately 57% of patients with intrahepatic recurrence had recurrence </=2.5 cm from SM. CONCLUSIONS: Intrahepatic recurrence after partial hepatectomy is common and is significantly associated with vascular invasion and tumor stage. About 57% of patients with intrahepatic relapse had a recurrence close (</=2.5 cm) to the SM. Additionally, patients with SM <1 mm have a higher recurrence rate and may benefit from adjuvant local therapy.",

Measured effects of sediments and their elutriates were varied and reflected responses that were ecotoxicity test-, endpoint- and site-dependent, suggesting some degree of risk toward benthic and water column organisms, respectively, at specific sites. Correlation analysis demonstrated that L-SPA and M-SPA ecotoxicity responses were significantly linked with the Hydra H(SL)-SPA assay, indicating their ability to predict ecotoxicity towards an invertebrate taxonomic group representing secondary consumers. While the L-SPA and M-SPA assays hold promise as rapid screens for sediment ecotoxicity, correlation analysis with grain size (L-SPA: r=-0.795, P=0.033; M-SPA: r=-0.73, P=0.07) points out that their responses can be influenced by the presence of fines (i.e., sediment particles </=0.063 mm in size) and that this information is essential to properly interpret ecotoxicity data generated with these assays. Finally, notable differences observed in trophic level sensitivities once again recall the importance of employing a test battery to adequately appraise the ecotoxicity of sediments.",

We hypothesize that through adolescent heavy drinking alcohol gains access to appetitive learning. A primary consequence is that alcohol-predictive cues become valued and sought out. To test this hypothesis, we gave genetically heterogeneous, male Long Evans rats voluntary, chronic intermittent access to water or alcohol throughout adolescence and then identified moderate and heavy alcohol drinkers. After a short abstinence period, we assessed the aversive or appetitive properties of alcohol using flavor learning procedures. We compared alcohol to the known appetitive properties of sugar. Flavor learning in adult rats who were alcohol-naive or adolescent moderate alcohol drinkers revealed alcohol to be aversive and sugar to be appetitive. The same flavor learning procedures revealed both alcohol and sugar to be appetitive in adult rats who were adolescent heavy drinkers. The results demonstrate that alcohol gains access to neurobehavioral circuits for appetitive learning through adolescent heavy alcohol drinking.",

SETTING: The neonatal intensive care unit service of a major obstetric tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Infants admitted to the neonatal unit who developed P. aeruginosa colonization or infection. METHODS: We undertook whole genome sequencing of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from colonized infants and from the neonatal unit environment. RESULTS: Eighteen infants were colonized with P. aeruginosa. Isolates from 12 infants and 7 environmental samples were sequenced. All but one of the clinical isolates clustered in ST253 and no differences were detected between unmapped reads. The environmental isolates revealed a variety of sequence types, indicating a large diverse bioburden within the unit, which was subsequently confirmed via enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction typing of post-outbreak isolates. One environmental isolate, obtained from a sink in the unit, clustered within ST253 and differed from the outbreak strain by 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms only. This information allowed us to focus infection control activities on this sink. CONCLUSIONS: Whole genome sequencing can provide detailed information in a clinically relevant time frame to aid management of outbreaks in critical patient management areas. The superior discriminatory power of this method makes it a powerful tool in infection control.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To study the relationship between amplitude of spontaneous retinal venous pulsatility (SRVP) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness in glaucomatous eyes, and to determine if this parameter may be a potential marker for glaucoma severity. METHOD: 85 subjects including 50 glaucoma (21 males, 67+/-10 yrs) and 35 normals (16 males, 62+/-11 yrs) were studied. SRVP amplitude was measured using the Dynamic Vessel Analyser (DVA, Imedos, Germany) at four regions of the retina simultaneously within one disc diameter from the optic disc--temporal-superior (TS), nasal-superior (NS), temporal-inferior (TI) and nasal-inferior (NI)). This was followed by RNFL thickness measurement using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (Spectralis OCT). The correlation between SRVP amplitude and corresponding sectoral RNFL thickness was assessed by means of non-linear regression (i.e. logarithmic). Linear regression was also applied and slopes were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: Greater SRVP amplitude was associated with thicker RNFL. Global SRVP amplitude was significantly lower in glaucoma eyes compared with normals (p<0.0001). The correlation coefficient of the linear regression between RNFL and SRVP at TS, NS, TI and NI quadrants in the glaucoma group were r = 0.5, 0.5, 0.48, 0.62. Mean SRVP amplitude and RNFL thickness for TS, NS, TI and NI quadrants were 4.3+/-1.5, 3.5+/-1.3, 4.7+/-1.6, 3.1+/-1 mum and 96+/-30, 75+/-22, 89+/-35 and 88+/-30 mum, respectively. The ANCOVA test showed that the slope of linear regression between the four quadrants was not significant (p>0.05). Since the slopes are not significantly different, it is possible to calculate one slope for all the data. The pooled slope equals 10.8 (i.e. RNFL = 10.8SRVP+41). CONCLUSION: While SRVP was present and measurable in all individuals, the amplitude of SRVP is reduced in glaucoma with increasing RNFL loss. Our findings suggest the degree of SRVP may be an additional marker for glaucoma severity. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of reduction in SRVP, and whether changes can predict increased risk of progression.",

The mean values for the majority of properties sampled over five periods from pre-1900 to 2013 were found to change in a statistically significant manner. In contrast, lipophilicity and aromatic ring count remained relatively constant, suggesting that these parameters are the most important for successful prosecution of a natural product drug discovery program if the route of administration is not focused exclusively on oral availability. An examination by therapy area revealed that anti-infective agents had the most differences in physicochemical property profiles compared with other areas, particularly with respect to lipophilicity. However, when this group was removed, the variation between the mean values for lipophilicity and aromatic ring count across the remaining therapy areas was again found not to change in a meaningful manner, further highlighting the importance of these two parameters. The vast majority of drugs with a natural progenitor were formulated for either oral and/or injectable administration. Injectables were, on average, larger and more polar than drugs developed for oral, topical, and inhalation routes.",

We discuss the publication structure from the study, including concept, protocol baseline, primary and secondary outcome papers, as well as ancillary papers related to studies conducted using biosamples from the study repository. We demonstrate that the primary outcome paper remains far and away the most impactful publication from this study. However, we note also that other related publications, including the baseline paper and some papers related to secondary hypotheses, such as prediction models, can still be relatively impactful. However, the most impactful ancillary publications arose from utilizing specimens in the repository to test post hoc hypotheses. Therefore, establishing a repository of serum and DNA samples, and potentially other biological specimens (i.e., semen, urine, biome samples, etc.) and making these specimens and data available to investigators may provide further meaningful productivity to a large pragmatic multicenter trial known here as PERCT.",

Methods This was an observational, cross-sectional study covering hospital and community samples of 317 women aged 39-62 years. Two questionnaires were administered, namely, the MRS-TC version, made up of 11 items in three dimensions, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to examine the test-retest reliability of the questionnaire on two separate occasions, 2 weeks apart. The internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha. To evaluate criterion validity, the relationship between the individual items and dimension scores of both instruments was estimated. Pearson's correlation was used to assess convergent and discriminant validity; construct validity was evaluated by comparing the mean scores of menopausal and non-menopausal women for each of the MRS dimensions. Results The final questionnaire comprised 11 items in three dimensions. The intra-class correlation (ICC) for the test-retest reliability ranged from 0.83 to 0.93; values of Cronbach's alpha for psychological, somatic, and urogenital symptom domains were 0.88, 0.68, and 0.59, respectively. For the convergent and discriminant validity, the correlations between the individual questionnaire and the WHOQOL-BREF were significant; those with the MRS dimensions were significantly negatively associated for the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains. Conclusion The MRS-TC version using the traditional Chinese language is a reliable and valid questionnaire for assessing menopausal symptoms and global quality of life in climacteric women.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is over-expressed in several malignancies and represents an important therapeutic target. Aptamers are oligonucleotides that may potentially serve as tumor-homing ligand with excellent affinity and specificity for targeted cancer therapy. However, aptamers need to have nuclease resistance in order to function in vivo. The aim of this study was to generate a novel HER2 thioaptamer with enhanced nuclease resistance. METHODS: The HER2 thioaptamer is selected in an evolutionary process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. RESULTS: The thioaptamer could bind to the extracellular domain of HER2 with a K d of 172 nM and had minimal cross reactivity to trypsin or IgG. Moreover, the thioaptamer was found capable of binding with the HER2-positive breast cancer cells SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-453, but not the HER2-negative cells MDA-MB-231. Notably, the thioaptamer HY6 largely maintained its structural integrity facing the nucleases in serum, while regular DNA aptamers were mostly digested. Additionally, the thioaptamer retained the capability of binding with the HER2-positive cells in the presence of serum, whereas non-thionated HER2 aptamer lost the binding function. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the selected thioaptamer was more resistant to nuclease than regular DNA aptamers and might potentially function as a HER2-targeting ligand in complicated environment.",

Outbreak-related cases were identified from epidemiological information in medical records and from genotyping of TB isolates. Social network information from case interviews were used to identify potential locations of TB transmission, where symptom screening and tuberculin skin testing was conducted. Fifty-two cases that were predominantly male (47/52), Canadian-born (44/50), and were homeless or associated with homeless individuals (42/52) were reported from May 2008 to May 2014. Many isolates (40/49) had partial resistance to isoniazid. Transmission primarily occurred at two homeless shelters, with potential further transmission at sites visited by the general population. TB outbreaks in homeless populations can occur in small, low-incidence cities. Social network information helped prioritize sites for TB screening, thereby improving detection of persons with TB disease or latent infection for treatment.",

In this study, pulsatile double-compression-coated tablets were prepared based on time-controlled hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K100M inner compression coat and pH-sensitive Eudragit S100 outer compression coat. Then, the tablets were evaluated for both physical evaluation and drug-release studies, and to prove these results, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in human volunteers were conducted. From the in vitro drug-release studies, F6 tablets were considered as the best formulation, which retarded the drug release in the stomach and small intestine (3.42 +/- 0.12% in 5 h) and progressively released to the colon (99.78 +/- 0.74% in 24 h). The release process followed zero-order release kinetics, and from the stability studies, similarity factor between dissolution data before and after storage was found to be 88.86. From the pharmacokinetic evaluation, core mini-tablets producing peak plasma concentration (C max) was 14,677.51 +/- 12.16 ng/ml at 3 h T max and pulsatile colonic tablets showed C max = 12,374.67 +/- 16.72 ng/ml at 12 h T max. The area under the curve for the mini and pulsatile tablets was 41,238.52 and 72,369.24 ng-h/ml, and the mean resident time was 3.43 and 10.61 h, respectively. In conclusion, development of double-compression-coated tablets is a promising way to achieve the pulsatile colonic release of flurbiprofen.",

In addition, primary air rescue has proved to be effective as a support for the standard ground-based ambulance services in some regions of Germany during the night. Under certain conditions, such as the strict adherence to established, practiced and coordinated procedures, air rescue at night does not have a significantly higher risk compared to operations in daytime. Particular requirements should be imposed for air rescue operations at night: a strict indication system for alerting, 4-man helicopter crews solely during the night as well as pilots (and copilots) with the correct qualifications and experience in dealing with night vision devices on a regular basis. Moreover, the helicopters need to be suitable and approved for night flying including cabin upgrades and the appropriate medical technology equipment.

The mechanism of matrix destruction resulting in cavitation is not well defined. Neutrophils are emerging as key mediators of TB immunopathology and their influx are associated with poor outcomes. We investigated neutrophil-dependent mechanisms involved in TB-associated matrix destruction using a cellular model, a cohort of 108 patients, and in separate patient lung biopsies. Neutrophil-derived NF-kB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) secretion was up-regulated in TB and caused matrix destruction both in vitro and in respiratory samples of TB patients. Collagen destruction induced by TB infection was abolished by doxycycline, a licensed MMP inhibitor. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contain MMP-8 and are increased in samples from TB patients. Neutrophils lined the circumference of human pulmonary TB cavities and sputum MMP-8 concentrations reflected TB radiological and clinical disease severity. AMPK, a central regulator of catabolism, drove neutrophil MMP-8 secretion and neutrophils from AMPK-deficient patients secrete lower MMP-8 concentrations. AMPK-expressing neutrophils are present in human TB lung biopsies with phospho-AMPK detected in nuclei. These data demonstrate that neutrophil-derived MMP-8 has a key role in the immunopathology of TB and is a potential target for host-directed therapy in this infectious disease.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 50 patients, 29 to 85 years old. One hundred twenty-eight implants were subdivided based on sinus augmentation technique as determined by available native bone height. Thirty-three implants were placed using OSFE in at least 8.0 mm of bone. Forty-four implants were synchronously placed using 1-step LWT in 3.0 to 7.9 mm of bone. In cases with less than 3.0 mm of bone, the 2-step LWT was performed and the remaining 51 implants were placed after a period of healing. Implant stability quotient (ISQ) was recorded from RFA at stage 1 and subsequently at stage 2 (follow-up) 3 to 12 months later. Statistical analysis was completed using t test and analysis of variance to assess differences in implant stability over time and among techniques, respectively. RESULTS: ISQ values at placement averaged 70.9, 68.9, and 72.2 for OSFE, LWT, and LWT with delayed placement, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (P = .2). At stage 2 (follow-up), average ISQ values were 76.7, 77.7, and 78.7 for OSFE, LWT, and LWT with delayed placement, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (P = .3). In contrast, differences in ISQ at stage 2 (follow-up) versus stage 1 were statistically significant for all 3 techniques (P < .01). OSFE, 1-step LWT, and 2-step LWT yielded average increases in ISQ of 5.8, 8.8, and 6.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of OSFE, 1-step LWT, and 2-step LWT to augment bone in the atrophic edentulous posterior maxilla. All 3 methods provide predictable osseointegration and yield statistical increases in ISQ at stage 2 (follow-up) compared with time of placement. With appropriate case selection according to native vertical bone height, there are no statistical differences in ISQ among these 3 techniques at either stage.",

Experimental endometriosis was established in 32 rats. They were randomly divided into 4 groups (8 rats for each group) to administer study drugs: pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and normal saline. Histological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining to determine endometriosis score and immunostaining with primary vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD117, and Bax antibodies were performed. Bilateral ovaries excised to determine the ovarian follicle number. The endometriosis score was significantly reduced by pazopanib compared to other study drugs and by sunitinib compared to sorafenib and normal saline (P < .05). Sorafenib did not affect endometriosis score (P > .05). The VEGF score was significantly decreased similarly by pazopanib, sunitinib, and sorafenib compared to normal saline (P < .05). The CD117 score was reduced by pazopanib and sunitinib similarly compared to both sorafenib and normal saline that provided similar effect on the score (P < .05). The Bax scores of all the groups were found similar (P > .05). No study drugs caused meaningful change in the ovarian follicle number (P > .05). Pazopanib reduces the growth of endometriotic implants. This effect may be related to the suppressive effect of pazopanib on the endometriotic tissue expressions of VEGF and CD117 but not Bax. The study drugs do not affect ovarian reserve. The inconsistent effects of study drugs regarding study parameters require further studies to elucidate the molecular bases of their effects on the growth of endometriotic implants.",

We report here the sequence and gene structure of a clone isolated from a cosmid library which, to our knowledge, represents the largest contiguously sequenced, dinoflagellate genomic, tandem gene array. These data, combined with information from a large transcriptomic library, allowed a high level of confidence of every base pair call. This degree of confidence is not possible with PCR-based contigs. The sequence contains an intron-rich set of five highly expressed gene repeats arranged in tandem. One of the tandem repeat gene members contains an intron 26,372 bp long. This study characterizes a splice site consensus sequence for dinoflagellate introns. Two to nine base pairs around the 3' splice site are repeated by an identical two to nine base pairs around the 5' splice site. The 5' and 3' splice sites are in the same locations within each repeat so that the repeat is found only once in the mature mRNA. This identically repeated intron boundary sequence might be useful in gene modeling and annotation of genomes.",

        "abstract": "A small number of cetaceans have adapted to an entirely freshwater environment, having colonized rivers in Asia and South America from an ancestral origin in the marine environment. This includes the 'river dolphins', early divergence from the odontocete lineage, and two species of true dolphins (Family Delphinidae). Successful adaptation to the freshwater environment may have required increased demands in energy involved in processes such as the mitochondrial osmotic balance. For this reason, riverine odontocetes provide a compelling natural experiment in adaptation of mammals from marine to freshwater habitats. Here we present initial evidence of positive selection in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 of riverine odontocetes by analyses of full mitochondrial genomes, using tests of selection and protein structure modeling. The codon model with highest statistical support corresponds to three discrete categories for amino acid sites, those under positive, neutral, and purifying selection. With this model we found positive selection at site 297 of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (dN/dS>1.0,) leading to a substitution of an Ala or Val from the ancestral state of Thr. A phylogenetic reconstruction of 27 cetacean mitogenomes showed that an Ala substitution has evolved at least four times in cetaceans, once or more in the three 'river dolphins' (Families Pontoporidae, Lipotidae and Inidae), once in the riverine Sotalia fluviatilis (but not in its marine sister taxa), once in the riverine Orcaella brevirostris from the Mekong River (but not in its marine sister taxa) and once in two other related marine dolphins. We located the position of this amino acid substitution in an alpha-helix channel in the trans-membrane domain in both the E. coli structure and Sotalia fluviatilis model. In E. coli this position is located in a helix implicated in a proton translocation channel of respiratory complex 1 and may have a similar role in the NADH dehydrogenases of cetaceans.",

        "abstract": "Secondary structure-forming DNA sequences such as CAG repeats interfere with replication and repair, provoking fork stalling, chromosome fragility, and recombination. In budding yeast, we found that expanded CAG repeats are more likely than unexpanded repeats to localize to the nuclear periphery. This positioning is transient, occurs in late S phase, requires replication, and is associated with decreased subnuclear mobility of the locus. In contrast to persistent double-stranded breaks, expanded CAG repeats at the nuclear envelope associate with pores but not with the inner nuclear membrane protein Mps3. Relocation requires Nup84 and the Slx5/8 SUMO-dependent ubiquitin ligase but not Rad51, Mec1, or Tel1. Importantly, the presence of the Nup84 pore subcomplex and Slx5/8 suppresses CAG repeat fragility and instability. Repeat instability in nup84, slx5, or slx8 mutant cells arises through aberrant homologous recombination and is distinct from instability arising from the loss of ligase 4-dependent end-joining. Genetic and physical analysis of Rad52 sumoylation and binding at the CAG tract suggests that Slx5/8 targets sumoylated Rad52 for degradation at the pore to facilitate recovery from acute replication stress by promoting replication fork restart. We thereby confirmed that the relocation of damage to nuclear pores plays an important role in a naturally occurring repair process.",

Based on a maximum likelihood analysis of committor values computed for configurations obtained by Wang-Landau sampling, we construct a non-linear string reaction coordinate for the coil-to-crystal transition. In contrast to a linear reaction coordinate, the string reaction coordinate captures the effect of different degrees of freedom controlling different stages of the transition. Our analysis indicates that a combination of the energy and the global crystallinity parameter Q6 provide the most accurate measure for the progress of the transition. While the crystallinity paramter Q6 is most relevant in the initial stages of the crystallization, the later stages are dominated by a decrease in the potential energy.",

Neurotoxicity involves the response of glial cells, mainly astrocytes, which play a fundamental role in the control of homeostasis of the CNS. Some Erythroxylum species are indigenous to the state of Bahia in Brazil. This study investigated the cytotoxic activity of the diterpene AEP-1, extracted from the fruit of E. passerinum in a GL-15 cell line, astrocytic, glial cells model. The effects on cell viability, analyzed by the MTT assay, demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, with maximum effect at 500 mug/mL of AEP-1, and with a reduction of about 40 and 47% on cellular viability after 24 h and 72 h treatment, respectively. Evidence for induction of apoptosis by AEP-1 was first obtained when GL-15 glial cells were incubated with 250 mug/mL AEP-1 causing reniform and/or pyknotic nuclei and apoptotic bodies revealed by chromatin staining with Hoechst 33258. Increase in DNA fragmentation was also observed by comet assays in cells incubated with 500 mug/mL of AEP-1. Moreover, cells exposed to a sub toxic dose of AEP-1 (250 mug/mL) showed significant changes in morphology--contraction of the cytoplasm and expansion of cellular projections--signifying the presence of astrocytic cytoskeletal protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These findings indicated astrocytic cells as the target for terpene AEP-1 and suggest the involvement of glial cells with psychoactive symptoms observed in humans and animals after consumption of fruits of plants of the genus Erythroxylum.",

        "abstract": "Understanding animal behavior and development requires visualization and analysis of their synaptic connectivity, but existing methods are laborious or may not depend on trans-synaptic interactions. Here we describe a transgenic approach for in vivo labeling of specific connections in Caenorhabditis elegans, which we term iBLINC. The method is based on BLINC (Biotin Labeling of INtercellular Contacts) and involves trans-synaptic enzymatic transfer of biotin by the Escherichia coli biotin ligase BirA onto an acceptor peptide. A BirA fusion with the presynaptic cell adhesion molecule NRX-1/neurexin is expressed presynaptically, whereas a fusion between the acceptor peptide and the postsynaptic protein NLG-1/neuroligin is expressed postsynaptically. The biotinylated acceptor peptide::NLG-1/neuroligin fusion is detected by a monomeric streptavidin::fluorescent protein fusion transgenically secreted into the extracellular space. Physical contact between neurons is insufficient to create a fluorescent signal, suggesting that synapse formation is required. The labeling approach appears to capture the directionality of synaptic connections, and quantitative analyses of synapse patterns display excellent concordance with electron micrograph reconstructions. Experiments using photoconvertible fluorescent proteins suggest that the method can be utilized for studies of protein dynamics at the synapse. Applying this technique, we find connectivity patterns of defined connections to vary across a population of wild-type animals. In aging animals, specific segments of synaptic connections are more susceptible to decline than others, consistent with dedicated mechanisms of synaptic maintenance. Collectively, we have developed an enzyme-based, trans-synaptic labeling method that allows high-resolution analyses of synaptic connectivity as well as protein dynamics at specific synapses of live animals.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of dexamethasone on the differentiation of rat tendon stem cells (TSCs) to tenocytes and the underlying molecular mechanisms and found that dexamethasone inhibits the differentiation of TSCs to tenocytes by analyzing the development of long, spindle-shaped cells and detecting the expression of tenocyte markers type I collagen and tenomodulin (TNMD) at both the mRNA and protein levels. We also discovered that after treatment with dexamethasone, the scleraxis expression level is downregulated in vitro and in human specimen. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR showed that dexamethasone promotes glucocorticoid receptor interacted with the TGGAAGCC sequence located between -734 and -726 base pairs (bp) upstream of the start codon of the scleraxis gene. Furthermore, TSCs were transfected with scleraxis knockdown or overexpression plasmids, and the results indicated that scleraxis plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of TSCs to tenocytes. In conclusion, dexamethasone inhibits the differentiation of TSCs to tenocytes by inhibiting the scleraxis gene.",

Stigma attraction or devalued social identity is twofold: (1) it is a cancer associated with lifestyle risk factors and (2) treatment often results in confronting facial disfigurement. Subjective interpretations from nine head and neck cancer patients were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. An overarching superordinate theme--Distress, Stigma and Psychological Growth--encompassed four subordinate themes. Two themes captured the expressed trauma and terror as a result of diagnosis and treatment, and two the redefining of self despite stigma through meaning making. Distress was interpreted as a catalyst for awakening new life interpretations and combined with social support to facilitate two distinct pathways of growth: (1) psychological growth without support; (2) psychological and relational growth with support. Previously unfelt empathetic understanding and altruism for others with cancer emerged from the impact of stigma on 'self'. Acceptance allowed a new sense of identity that recognised cancer-related traumatic distress as integral to growth for these participants. The present study offers a unique insight into cancer-related trauma and stigma and the potential to redefine a more accepting, empathic and altruistic 'self' for psychological growth.

This transkingdom life cycle requires rapid responses to vastly different environments, including transitions from plant phloem sieve elements to various insect tissues and alternations among diverse plant hosts. Features that enable such flexibility in other microbes include simple sequence repeats (SSRs) - mutation-prone, phase-variable short DNA tracts that function as 'evolutionary rheostats' and enhance rapid adaptations. To gain insights into the occurrence, distribution and potentially functional roles of SSRs in phytoplasmas, we performed computational analysis on the genomes of five completely sequenced phytoplasma strains, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris'-related strains OYM and AYWB, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense'-related strains CBWB and SLY and 'Candidatus Phytoplasma mali'-related strain AP-AT. The overall density of SSRs in phytoplasma genomes was higher than in representative strains of other prokaryotes. While mono- and trinucleotide SSRs were significantly overrepresented in the phytoplasma genomes, dinucleotide SSRs and other higher-order SSRs were underrepresented. The occurrence and distribution of long SSRs in the prophage islands and phytoplasma-unique genetic loci indicated that SSRs played a role in compounding the complexity of sequence mosaics in individual genomes and in increasing allelic diversity among genomes. Findings from computational analyses were further complemented by an examination of SSRs in varied additional phytoplasma strains, with a focus on potential contingency genes. Some SSRs were located in regions that could profoundly alter the regulation of transcription and translation of affected genes and/or the composition of protein products.",

Chinese proprietary herbal medicines, as Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) products, are usually developed from well-established and long-standing recipes formulated as tablets or capsules. However, good quantification and strict standardization are still needed for implementation of individualized therapies. The Qishe pill was developed and has been used clinically since 2009. The Qishe pill's personalized medicine should be documented and administered to various patients according to the ancient TCM system, a classification of personalized constitution types, established to determine predisposition and prognosis to diseases as well as therapy and life-style administration. Therefore, we describe the population pharmacokinetic profile of the Qishe pill and compare its metabolic rate in the three major constitution types (Qi-Deficiency, Yin-Deficiency and Blood-Stasis) to address major challenges to individualized standardized TCM. METHODS/DESIGN: Healthy subjects (N = 108) selected based on constitutional types will be assessed, and standardized pharmacokinetic protocol will be used for assessing demographic, physiological, and pathological data. Laboratory biomarkers will be evaluated and blood samples collected for pharmacokinetics(PK) analysis and second-generation gene sequencing. In single-dose administrations, subjects in each constitutional type cohort (N = 36) will be randomly divided into three groups to receive different Qishe pill doses (3.75, 7.5 and 15 grams). Multiomics, including next generation sequencing, metabolomics, and proteomics, will complement the Qishe pill's multilevel assessment, with cytochrome P450 genes as targets. In a comparison with the general population, a systematic population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model for the Qishe pill will be established and verified.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In response to rising TB notification rates in England, universal strain typing was introduced in 2010. We evaluated the acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the TB strain typing service (TB-STS). METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation using routine laboratory, clinic and public health data. We estimated the effect of the TB-STS on detection of false positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnoses (2010-2012); contact tracing yield (number of infections or active disease per pulmonary TB case); and diagnostic delay. We developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental model to explore the effectiveness of the TB-STS, which informed a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Semi-structured interviews explored user experience. Strain typing identified 17 additional false positive diagnoses. The TB-STS had no significant effect on contact tracing yield or diagnostic delay. Mathematical modelling suggested increasing the proportion of infections detected would have little value in reducing TB incidence in the white UK-born population. However, in the non-white UK-born and non-UK-born populations, over 20 years, if detection of latent infection increases from 3% to 13% per year, then TB incidence would decrease by 11%; reducing diagnostic delay by one week could lead to 25% reduction in incidence. The current TB-STS was not predicted to be cost-effective over 20 years ( pound95 628/quality-adjusted life-years). Interviews found people had mixed experiences, but identified broader benefits, of the TB-STS. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce costs, improve efficiency and increase effectiveness, we recommend changes to the TB-STS, including discontinuing routine cluster investigations and focusing on reducing diagnostic delay across the TB programme. This evaluation of a complex intervention informs the future of strain typing in the era of rapidly advancing technologies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Percutaneous brachytherapy is a valuable method for the treatment of lung cancer and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis. However, in some of the metastatic lymph nodes in the middle mediastinum, the percutaneous approach cannot be used safely due to possible damage to surrounding anatomical structures. We established an animal model (group of 12 pigs) to assess the safety and feasibility of computed tomography (CT)-guided vena cava puncture. METHODS: Under CT guidance, an 18G needle was used to puncture the anterior wall of the anterior vena cava (AVC) in 12 pigs. The 18G needle was chosen as it is similar in size to the needles employed for clinical application in brachytherapy. The incidence of complications and vital signs was monitored during the procedure. Thoracotomy was performed to remove AVC specimens, which were analyzed for histological evidence of vessel wall damage and repair. RESULTS: Following postoperative enhanced CT, two animals were found to have a small pneumothorax (one being hemopneumothorax). The intraoperative oxygen saturation of both animals was not significantly decreased and was maintained at 93-100%. No animals developed mediastinal hematoma. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative changes in blood pressure, heart rate, hemoglobin, and blood oxygen saturation were not significant. Histological evaluation of AVC specimens showed that by 7 days following the procedure, the endothelial layer was smooth with notable scar repair in the muscularis layer. CONCLUSIONS: CT performed after the procedure and histological preparations confirmed the safety of the procedure. This indicates that percutaneous brachytherapy for metastatic middle mediastinal lymph nodes can be carried out via the superior vena cava.",

The biofilm layer essentially forms a protective barrier encapsulating the bacterial colony and thus reduces the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics. We have isolated 9EA-FC-B bioactive fraction from Acalypha wilkesiana Mull. Arg. that reverses ampicillin resistant in MRSA through inhibition of the antibiotic resistant protein, penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of 9EA-FC-B on MRSA biofilm forming capacity. METHODS: Inhibition of biofilm production and microtiter attachment assays were employed to study the anti-biofilm activity of 9EA-FC-B, while latex agglutination test was performed to investigate the effect on PBP2a in the biofilm matrix. We also attempted to characterise the chemical components of the fraction using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and phytochemical analysis. RESULTS: Fraction 9EA-FC-B and ampicillin exhibited similar inhibitory effect on MRSA's biofilm production at their respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (81.56% vs 84.49%, respectively). However, the test fraction was more effective in suppressing cell surface attachment (90.85%) compared to ampicillin (37.8%). Interestingly, ampicillin enhanced the level PBP2a and in the contrary 9EA-FC-B attenuated the production of the resistant protein in the bioflim matrix. HPLC and phytochemical analysis revealed that 9EA-FC-B fraction is a complex mixture containing tannins, saponins, sterol/steroids, and glycosides. CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive fraction 9EA-FC-B inhibited the production of MRSA biofilm by preventing the initial cell-surface attachment and reducing the amount PBP2a in the matrix. PBP2a found in the biofilm matrix is believed to have a role in the development of virulence in MRSA.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Ga-68-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands have been used clinically for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostate cancer. However, F-18-labeled compounds offer several advantages, including the potential for delayed imaging, high starting activities enabling multidose preparation, and improved spatial resolution in PET. For F-18 labeling of peptides conjugated with a suitable chelator, a fast and feasible method is the use of [Al(18)F](2+). In the present study, the radiofluorinations of a well-known PSMA ligand Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (PSMA-HBED) via [Al(18)F](2+) were performed with respect to various reaction parameters, along with the biological evaluations in a cell experiment. PROCEDURES: [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED was prepared by adding Na[(18)F]F into a vial containing 0.026 mumol peptide (in 0.05 M NaOAc buffer) and 0.03 mumol AlCl3\u22c56H2O (in 0.05 M NaOAc buffer). Then, it was stirred at different temperatures from 1 to 30 min. Afterwards, purification was carried out by solid phase extraction. Biological evaluations were performed in PSMA-positive cell lines LNCaP C4-2, along with a negative control using PC-3 cell lines. RESULTS: The best labeling results (81 +/- 0.5 %, n = 4) were observed with 0.026 mumol peptide (30  degrees C, 5 min). For preclinical experiments, the production of [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED at 35  degrees C including purification by solid phase extraction (SPE) succeeded within 45 min, resulting in a radiochemical yield of 49 +/- 1.2 % (decay-corrected, n = 6, radiochemical purity >/=98 %) at EOS. The labeled peptide revealed serum stability for 4 h as well as a promising binding coefficient (K D) value of 10.3 +/- 2.2 nM in cell experiments with PSMA-positive LNCaP C4-2 cells. CONCLUSION: An efficient and one-pot method for the radiosynthesis of [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED was developed (0.26 mumol of precursor at 35  degrees C). In cell culture studies, the K D suggests [Al(18)F]PSMA-HBED as a potential PSMA ligand for future investigations in vivo and clinical applications afterwards.",

In this research, we applied confocal Raman technology combined with optical microscopy to investigate the relationship between the hygroscopic behavior and the molecular interactions of mixed glycerol/Mg(NO3)2/water droplets. Raman spectra provide detailed structural information about the interactions between glycerol molecules and Mg(2+) ions, as well as information about the interactions between glycerol and NO3(-) ions through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. The change of the CH2 stretching band of glycerol molecules in mixed droplets suggests that the backbone structures of glycerol mainly transform from alphaalpha to gammagamma in the dehumidifying process, and the additional Mg(2+) ions strongly influence the structure of glycerol molecules. Because the existence of glycerol suppresses the crystallization of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O in the dehumidifying process, Mg(NO3)2 molecules in mixed droplets form an amorphous state rather than forming crystals of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O when the relative humidity is lower than 17.8%. Moreover, in mixed droplets, the molar ratio of NO3(-) to glycerol is higher in the center than in the outer region.",

The synthesized pollen-templated bioactive glass particles (PBGPs) exhibited dual macro-nano porous structure. The macro pores ( approximately  1 mum) were inherited from the template of pollen grains while the nano pores ( approximately  9.5 nm) were induced by the intrinsic mechanism of the sol-gel process. PBGPs possessed a high specific surface area (111.4m(2)/g) and pore volume (0.35 cm(3)/g). Hydroxyapatite (HA) formation on PBGPs was detected within 3 days after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). Due to their larger specific surface area and pore volume, PBGPs could be loaded with more tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) than non-templated BGPs and conventional melt-derived 45S5 BGPs. In addition, PBGPs exhibited a low initial burst release (within 10% of the loaded amount) within 18 h and a sustained release with a two-stage release pattern for up to 6 days in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The antibacterial assay confirmed that the TCH-loaded PBGPs could release TCH within 5 days, and the released TCH could reach the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Escherichia coli. MTT assay indicated that PBGPs showed non-cytotoxic effects toward human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2) cells after co-culture for up to 72 h in vitro. These results showed that the biocompatible hierarchically macro-nano porous PBGPs are potential for bone regeneration and local drug delivery applications.",

This study suggests that short-term hearing results after stapedotomy recorded at the 3-month follow-up are without loss of vital information compared with data from the currently recommended > 12-month follow-up. The use of 3-month data in reporting outcome could reduce the bias inherent to the loss to follow-up at 12 months. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability of short-term postoperative hearing after stapedotomy for otosclerosis. METHODS: This was a prospective database study; 371 cases with otosclerosis were registered in the database between August 2004 and June 2013. We included the 166 primary cases and 37 revision cases that had attended both follow-ups. RESULTS: The mean changes in postoperative hearing thresholds between the 3-month and 12-month follow-up in both primary and revision cases were minimal and clinically insignificant. In all, 3-5% of primary cases and 14-16% of revision cases experienced a change of >/= 10 dB for the worse of one or more parameters between follow-ups. Results were also stable when considering a range of traditional success criteria. Other complications following surgery were infrequent and typically resolved long term.",

        "abstract": "Papaya meleira virus (PMeV) is the causal agent of papaya sticky disease, which is characterized by a spontaneous exudation of fluid and aqueous latex from the papaya fruit and leaves. The latex oxidizes after atmospheric exposure, resulting in a sticky feature on the fruit from which the name of the disease originates. PMeV is an isometric virus particle with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome of approximately 12 Kb. Unusual for a plant virus, PMeV particles are localized on and linked to the polymers present in the latex. The ability of the PMeV to inhabit such a hostile environment demonstrates an intriguing interaction of the virus with the papaya. A hypersensitivity response is triggered against PMeV infection, and there is a reduction in the proteolytic activity of papaya latex during sticky disease. In papaya leaf tissues, stress responsive proteins, mostly calreticulin and proteasome-related proteins, are up regulated and proteins related to metabolism are down-regulated. Additionally, PMeV modifies the transcription of several miRNAs involved in the modulation of genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Until now, no PMeV resistant papaya genotype has been identified and roguing is the only viral control strategy available. However, a single inoculation of papaya plants with PMeV dsRNA delayed the progress of viral infection.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate expression and prognostic significance of AMFR in colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: AMFR expression was evaluated in 127 colon cancer specimens, 131 rectal cancer specimens, and 47 colonic and 25 rectal corresponding lymph node metastases. Clinicopathological correlates of prognostic significance were established by univariate and multivariate analysis. Spearman's correlation determined the association of expression between cancers and their metastases. RESULTS: AMFR was over-expressed by 22% of colon cancers and 18% of rectal cancers. AMFR over-expression correlated significantly with improved disease-free survival (DFS) (P < .05) in colon cancer and decreased DFS in corresponding nodal metastases. In rectal cancer, AMFR over-expression significantly correlated with decreased overall survival, DFS, and disease-specific survival (P < .001, P = .031, P = .005, respectively) and decreased overall survival in corresponding metastases. CONCLUSION: AMFR may serve as a molecular prognosticator for colon cancer and rectal cancer.",

METHODS: Total 274 women aged 33~60 y with perimenopausal period were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of FSH and TP1NP were detected by electrochemiluminescence. RESULTS: In 274 perimenopausal women, the average level of TP1NP was (48.99+/-20.31) ng/mL, which was positively correlated with FSH level (r=0.159, P=0.009). In 40-50 age group, TP1NP level in women with FSH<40 mIU/mL was lower than that in those with FSH>/=40mIU/mL [(35.05+/-18.11) ng/mL vs (51.33+/-24.67) ng/mL; t=-2.954, P=0.004]. However, in <40 and 50-60 age groups, there were no significant differences in TP1NP levels between patients with FSH<40 mIU/mL and those with FSH>/=40 mIU/mL (t=-0.063, P=0.950; t=1.177, P=0.242). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that standardized coefficients of age variable was 0.047 (P=0.448) and standardized coefficients of FSH variable was 0.146 (P=0.019). CONCLUSION: TP1NP levels showed a certain correlation with FSH in perimenopausal women, especially for women aged 40-50, indicating that high FSH levels may be important factors for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.",

We retrospectively reviewed CMR studies performed between November 2007 and November 2013 in patients 16-45 years of age with unrepaired ASD (with or without partial anomalous pulmonary venous return) and with repaired TOF, who had previous infundibulotomy, but have not undergone pulmonary valve replacement. Longitudinal motion of lateral TV in four-chamber view cine image was tracked through the cardiac cycle with custom software. Twenty TOF patients and 12 ASD patients were included, and values were compared with 80 controls. Right ventricular end-diastolic volume index and right ventricular end-systolic volume index were similar in the ASD and TOF groups and were significantly higher in both groups than in controls. Maximum displacement of the TV in systole, velocity at half-maximal displacement during systole, and velocity at half-maximal displacement during early diastole were all significantly lower in the TOF group than the ASD group [1.39 +/- 0.47 vs. 2.21 +/- 0.46 (cm, p < 0.01), 5.9 +/- 2.1 vs. 10.1 +/- 2.3 (cm/s, p < 0.01), and 7.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 10.9 +/- 3.1 (cm/s, p < 0.05)]. TOF patients have diminished early diastolic TV AVJ velocity compared to patients with an unrepaired ASD, despite similar RV volumes.

However, little is known about the relationship between chronotype and metabolic disorders. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether late chronotype is related to metabolic abnormalities and body composition in middle-aged adults, independent of sleep duration and lifestyle. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1620 participants aged 47-59 years were recruited from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronotype was assessed by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Associations of chronotype with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, sarcopenia, and visceral obesity were analyzed. All participants underwent the oral glucose tolerance test, and body composition was measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Visceral obesity was designated as visceral fat area, measured by abdominal computed tomography, of >100 cm(2). RESULTS: Chronotype was classified as morning in 29.6% of subjects, evening in 5.9%, neither morning nor evening in 64.5%. Evening type, when compared with morning type, was significantly associated with diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.95), metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.05-2.87), and sarcopenia (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.36-7.33) after adjusting for confounding factors. Gender differences in the associations were evident. In men, evening type was associated with diabetes (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.39-6.39) and sarcopenia (OR, 3.89; 95% CI, 1.33-11.33). Only metabolic syndrome was associated with evening type in women (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.11-4.43). CONCLUSIONS: At the population level, evening chronotype was independently associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and sarcopenia. These results support the importance of circadian rhythms in metabolic regulation.",

Multiple factors are thought to be associated with these diseases, but to date a comprehensive epidemiological survey of disease risk factors has not been conducted. A survey of diet and health parameters was completed for 184 captive cheetahs in 86 international facilities. Comparisons were made among dietary factors with respect to disease status and observed faecal consistency, incidence of vomiting and diarrhoea in the past 4 weeks. Extremely dry faeces were most common in cheetahs fed carcasses, but was still of low incidence (15%). Contrastingly, cheetahs fed commercially prepared diets had the highest prevalence of liquid faeces \"always\" or \"often\" (9%). Cheetahs fed raw meat diets had the highest prevalence of soft faeces with no shape (22%), as well as of firm and dry faeces (40%). No broad category of diet exerted any influence on the health parameters investigated. However, feeding of ribs at least once per week reduced the odds of diarrhoea (P = 0.020) and feeding of long bones (limbs) at least once per week was associated with a lower odds of vomiting (P = 0.008). Cheetahs fed muscle meat at least once per week had reduced odds of suffering from chronic gastritis (P = 0.005) or non-specific gastrointestinal disease (P < 0.001). The only factor identified as increasing the odds of chronic gastritis was feeding of horse \"often\" or \"always\" (P = 0.023). The findings of the current study build on existing empirical research to support a recommendation towards a greater inclusion of skeletal components. Current husbandry guidelines advocating the use of supplemented raw meat diets are likewise supported, but the use of horse meat, as well as commercially prepared diets for captive cheetahs, warrants caution until further research is conducted.",

        "abstract": "The human pathogen Neisseria meningitides (Nm) attains serum resistance via a number of mechanisms, one of which involves binding to the host complement regulator protein vitronectin. We have shown previously that the Meningococcal surface fibril (Msf), a trimeric autotransporter, binds to the activated form of vitronectin (aVn) to increase Nm survival in human serum. In this study, we aimed to identify the aVn-binding region of Msf to assess its potential as an antigen which can elicit antibodies that block aVn binding and/or possess bactericidal properties. Using several recombinant Msf fragments spanning its surface-exposed region, the smallest aVn-binding recombinants were found to span residues 1-86 and 39-124. The use of further deletion constructs and overlapping recombinant Msf fragments suggested that a region of Msf comprising residues 39-82 may be primarily important for aVn binding and that other regions may also be involved but to a lesser extent. Molecular modelling implicated K66 and K68, conserved in all available Msf sequences, to be involved in the interaction. Recombinant fragments which bound to aVn were able to reduce the survival advantage conveyed by aVn-interaction in serum bactericidal assays. Antibodies raised against one such fragment inhibited aVn binding to Msf. In addition, the antibodies enhanced specific killing of Msf-expressing Nm in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, this study identifies an aVn-binding region of Msf, an adhesin known to impart serum resistance properties to the pathogen; and shows that this region of Msf can elicit antibodies with dual properties which reduce pathogen survival within the host and thus has potential as a vaccine antigen.",

We tested hypotheses that exposure to IPV, non-partner rape, hunger, pregnancy, depression and substance abuse predicted change in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell count in a dataset of 103 HIV infected young women aged 15-26 enrolled in a cluster randomised controlled trial. Multiple regression models were fitted to measure rate of change in CD4 and CD8 and including terms for age, person years of CD4+/CD8+ T-cell observation, HIV positivity at baseline, and stratum. Exposure variables included drug use, emotional, physical or sexual IPV exposure, non-partner rape, pregnancy and food insecurity. Mean CD4+ T cell count at baseline (or first HIV+ test) was 567.6 (range 1121-114). Participants were followed for an average of 1.3 years. The magnitude of change in CD4 T-cells was significantly associated with having ever experienced emotional abuse from a current partner at baseline or first HIV+ test (Coeff -132.9 95% CI -196.4, -69.4 p<0.0001) and drug use (Coeff -129.9 95% CI -238.7, -21.2 p=0.02). It was not associated with other measures. The change in CD8 T-cells was associated with having ever experienced emotional abuse at baseline or prior to the first HIV+ test (Coeff -178.4 95%CI -330.2, -26.5 p=0.02). In young ART-naive HIV positive women gender-based violence exposure in the form of emotional abuse is associated with a faster rate of decline in markers of cellular immunity. This highlights the importance of attending to emotional abuse when studying the physiological impact of IPV experience and the mechanisms of its impact on women's health.",

Etiologies may include arterial embolus, arterial or venous thrombosis, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. Other causes include vasculitis, traumatic injury, dissection of the aorta, cholesterol emboli, and intestinal obstruction. Mortality rates can approach 90% in the setting of bowel infarction. As such, it is important to establish an early diagnosis before the onset of bowel infarction. Treatment has traditionally involved surgical management. However, endovascular approaches have been increasingly reported in multiple case series describing success with initial endovascular therapy followed by open surgical intervention in some cases. Acuity of presentation, presence of bowel infarction, etiology of the ischemia, and risk factors may influence a planned treatment approach. The key to successful treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia involves early clinical recognition based on a detailed history and physical examination along with assessment of contributory risk factors, rapid acquisition of appropriate diagnostics to confirm a diagnosis, and early intervention to correct the underlying abnormality.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder resulting in a loss of function of the Fanconi anemia-related DNA repair pathway. Individuals with Fanconi anemia are predisposed to some cancers, including oropharyngeal and gynecologic cancers, with known associations with human papillomavirus (HPV) in the general population. As individuals with Fanconi anemia respond poorly to chemotherapy and radiation, prevention of cancer is critical. METHODS: To determine whether individuals with Fanconi anemia are particularly susceptible to oral HPV infection, we analyzed survey-based risk factor data and tested DNA isolated from oral rinses from 126 individuals with Fanconi anemia and 162 unaffected first-degree family members for 37 HPV types. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (11.1%) with Fanconi anemia tested positive, significantly more (P = 0.003) than family members (2.5%). While HPV prevalence was even higher for sexually active individuals with Fanconi anemia (17.7% vs. 2.4% in family; P = 0.003), HPV positivity also tended to be higher in the sexually inactive (8.7% in Fanconi anemia vs. 2.9% in siblings). Indeed, having Fanconi anemia increased HPV positivity 4.9-fold (95% CI, 1.6-15.4) considering age and sexual experience, but did not differ by other potential risk factors. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that oral HPV is more common in individuals with Fanconi anemia. It will be essential to continue to explore associations between risk factors and immune dysfunction on HPV incidence and persistence over time. IMPACT: HPV vaccination should be emphasized in those with Fanconi anemia as a first step to prevent oropharyngeal cancers, although additional studies are needed to determine whether the level of protection it offers in this population is adequate.",

Both types of interactions are mainly driven by the electrostatic and orbital interactions. The chalcogen bond becomes stronger in the order of NCH (sp) < NH3 (sp(3)) < NHCH2 (sp(2)), showing some inconsistence with the electronegativity of the hybridized N atom. The Li and methyl groups have an enhancing effect on the strength of chalcogen bond; however, the former is jointly achieved through the electrostatic and orbital interactions, whereas the orbital interaction has dominant contribution to the latter enhancement. The halogen bond with F2CX (X = O, S, Se) as the electron donor is stronger for the heavier chalcogen atom, exhibiting a reverse dependence on the chalcogen atom with that in hydrogen bonds. The halogen bond is further strengthened by the presence of chalcogen bond in the ternary complexes. In addition, CSD research confirms the abundance of Se...N interaction in crystal materials.",

        "abstract": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is known to play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of many tumors as well as normal development. This often occurs through mutation of the genes encoding RAS and RAF proteins which are involved in signal transduction in this pathway. BRAF is one of three RAF kinases which act as downstream effectors of growth factor signaling leading to cell cycle progression, proliferation, and survival. Initially reported as a point mutation (V600E) in the majority of metastatic melanomas, other alterations in the BRAF gene have now been reported in a variety of human cancers including papillary thyroid cancer, colon carcinomas, hairy cell leukemia, and more recently in gliomas. The identification of oncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene have led to a revolution in the treatment of metastatic melanoma using targeted molecular therapies that affect the MAPK pathway either directly through BRAF inhibition or downstream through inhibition of MEK. This review describes the molecular biology of BRAF in the context of pediatric low-grade gliomas, the role of BRAF as a diagnostic marker, the prognostic implications of BRAF, and evidence for therapeutic targeting of BRAF.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of all-cause and disease-specific mortality among older women with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and to identify mediators in the causal pathway. METHODS: Data were from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, a US population-based cohort study of 9,704 white women age >/=65 years. The analytic sample included women with hip radiographs at baseline (n = 7,889) and year 8 (n = 5,749). Mortality was confirmed through October 2013 by death certificates and hospital discharge summaries. Radiographic hip OA (RHOA) was defined as a Croft grade of >/=2 in at least 1 hip (definite joint space narrowing or osteophytes plus 1 other radiographic feature). RESULTS: The mean +/- SD followup time was 16.1 +/- 6.2 years. The baseline and year 8 prevalence of RHOA were 8.0% and 11.0%, respectively. The cumulative incidence (proportion of deaths during the study period) was 67.7% for all-cause mortality, 26.3% for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, 11.7% for cancer mortality, 1.9% for gastrointestinal disease mortality, and 27.8% for all other mortality causes. RHOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.14 [95% confidence interval 1.05-1.24]) and CVD mortality (hazard ratio 1.24 [95% confidence interval 1.09-1.41]) adjusted for age, body mass index, education, smoking, health status, diabetes, and stroke. These associations were partially explained by the mediating variable of physical function. CONCLUSION: RHOA was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality among older white women followed up for 16 years. Dissemination of evidence-based physical activity and self-management interventions for hip OA in community and clinical settings can improve physical function and might also contribute to lower mortality.",

This could result in potential advantages in the depiction of the membranous structures of the inner ear. The inner ear is particularly challenging to visualize at 7T because of its anatomic location, which can lead to susceptibility banding artifacts and signal loss. STUDY DESIGN: Three healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3T and 7T scanner. At 7T, a unilateral dielectric pad was used for image optimization. Scan duration therefore doubled to a total of 15 minutes at 7T. METHODS: The depiction of 10 anatomic parts of the inner ear was evaluated by two independent readers using a four-point grading scale. RESULTS: The interscalar septum, utricular macula, and the nerve bundles in the internal auditory canal were visualized more clearly at 7T. CONCLUSION: Although reduction of image artifacts remains challenging, especially at 7T, all structures depicted at 3T could be depicted at 7T. Image quality for some anatomic structures was superior at 7T. Further improvement of image quality could be achieved by developing dedicated surface coils and by technical advancement in B1 shimming and dedicated radiofrequency pulses.",

Labyrinthitis ossificans (LO) is a severe complication to bacterial meningitis and is characterized by destruction of inner ear structures by the formation of new bone. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of LO on bone remodeling of the otic capsule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 11 human temporal bones with extensive LO and 10 control specimens, the degree of bone remodeling was explored indirectly by estimating the viability of osteocytes in perilabyrinthine bone and the mastoid. RESULTS: The viability of osteocytes was significantly lower in the perilabyrinthine bone compared to the mastoid in both groups. However, the loss of perilabyrinthine osteocytes was the same in the 2 groups, and the presence of cartilage remnants appeared to be the same. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the factors affecting bone remodeling of the otic capsule and the degeneration of osteocytes are not altered by wholesale destruction of inner ear soft tissue and its replacement by bone. Therefore, alternative mechanisms may be implicated in the suppression of capsular bone remodeling.",

Pregnancy-related weight changes may contribute to this gender difference. The objectives of this study were to determine the associations between: 1. childhood socioeconomic disadvantage and midlife obesity; 2. excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and midlife obesity; and 3. childhood socioeconomic disadvantage and excessive GWG, among a representative sample of childbearing women. METHODS: We constructed marginal structural models for seven measures of childhood socioeconomic position for 4780 parous women in the United States, using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979-2010) data. Institute of Medicine definitions were used for excessive GWG; body mass index >/=30 at age 40 defined midlife obesity. Analyses were separated by race/ethnicity. Additionally, we estimated controlled direct effects of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage on midlife obesity under a condition of never gaining excessively in pregnancy. RESULTS: Low parental education, but not other measures of childhood disadvantage, was associated with greater midlife obesity among non-black non-Hispanic women. Among black and Hispanic mothers, childhood socioeconomic disadvantage was not consistently associated with midlife obesity. Excessive GWG was associated with greater midlife obesity in all racial/ethnic groups. Childhood socioeconomic disadvantage was not statistically significantly associated with excessive GWG in any group. Controlled direct effects were not consistently weaker than total effects. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with adult obesity, but not with excessive gestational weight gain, and only for certain disadvantage measures among non-black non-Hispanic mothers. Prevention of excessive GWG may benefit all groups through reducing obesity, but excessive GWG does not appear to serve as a mediator between childhood socioeconomic position and adult obesity in women.",

The sample consisted of 206 families with adolescents (ages 10-18 years) from predominantly low-income, high-risk neighborhoods. Monitoring behavior (parent reports), parental knowledge and parent-youth openness (youth reports), and adolescent adjustment (parent and youth reports) were all based on questionnaire data collected during a laboratory assessment. Results showed that when the monitoring behavior factors were examined simultaneously, only child disclosure was significantly and inversely related to youth antisocial behavior. In contrast, only parental involvement was significantly associated with less substance use. Moreover, school grades were significantly and incrementally predicted by both child disclosure and parental involvement. Parental solicitation was not significantly related to any of the adolescent outcomes. The findings also demonstrated evidence of indirect effects (via parental knowledge) in the link between monitoring behavior and adolescent adjustment. Implications regarding the socialization process during adolescence are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Spontaneous intracranial hypotension presents with many symptoms including orthostatic headache, dizziness, and nausea due to cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) leakage from the spinal dural sac. Although CSF leakage can be estimated by radioisotope (RI) cisternography or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging myelography, it is not easy to detect the leakage point using these modalities. Here, we describe a patient with spontaneous intracranial hypotension in whom three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) performed just after an epidural blood patch (EBP) containing contrast medium detected leakage point. The contrast medium injected into the epidural space at the L3/4 level migrated into the intradural space at the lower cervical spine level. RI cisternography performed before EBP did not show the CSF leakage point or any intracranial extension of the tracer. The rostral extension of the RI may be blocked by the collapse of the CSF space due to a large amount of CSF leakage, and due to the compression of the intradural CSF space by epidural CSF. 3D-CT epidurography may be useful to detect the fistula of a CSF leakage even in patients where other modalities including MRI, CT, or RI cisternography cannot specify the leakage point.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) sometimes develop myocardial fibrosis in association with adverse cardiovascular events. Electrocardiography (ECG) could provide helpful information on myocardial fibrosis in HCM, as in coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 60 patients with HCM without bundle branch block underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). The extent or location of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was examined in relation to 12-lead ECG. A notch on QRS was defined as at least 2 consecutive spikes in the same polarity with a reversal of direction >/=90 degrees and the initial negative deflection >/=0.05 mV. LGE was associated with notched QRS, leftward QRS axis, and prolonged QRS duration, but not with any other findings such as abnormal Q waves, R-wave amplitude, or ST-T changes. Notched QRS was most useful in determining the presence or absence of myocardial fibrosis, with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 81% using a cut-off of the number of leads with notched QRS >/=2. The number of notched QRS leads was positively correlated with LGE volume (P<0.01) and the lead distribution of notched QRS was informative about the location of LGE. CONCLUSIONS: A notch on QRS was useful in estimating myocardial fibrosis as assessed on CMR LGE in HCM patients without bundle branch block.",

Little is known, however, about the course of PTS after life threat in the absence of collateral stressors (e.g., bereavement, social stigma, property loss) and there is a scarcity of studies about PTS in the long term. This study assessed the short- and long-term course of PTS, and the influence of gender, education and age on the level and course of PTS, in survivors from a non-fatal airliner emergency landing caused by engine failure at an altitude of 1 km. There were 129 persons on board. A survey including the Impact of Event Scale was distributed to 106 subjects after 1 month, 4 months, 14 months, and 25 months, and to 95 subjects after 19 years (response rates 64-83%). There were initially high levels of PTS. The majority of changes in PTS occurred from 1 to 4 months after the event. There were small changes from 4 to 25 months but further decrease in PTS thereafter. Female gender was associated with higher levels of PTS whereas gender was unrelated to the slope of the short- and long-term trajectories. Higher education was related to a quicker recovery although not to initial or long-term PTS. Age was not associated with PTS. The present findings suggest that a life-threatening experience without collateral stressors may produce high levels of acute posttraumatic stress, yet with a benign prognosis. The findings further implicate that gender is unrelated to trajectories of recovery in the context of highly similar exposure and few collateral stressors.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and feasibility of a newly designed Heat Retention Head Wrap on infants during the rewarming period of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. METHODS: A sample of 10 infants was recruited into this descriptive pilot study. The health care providers completed ease-of-use questionnaires to describe the feasibility of the head wrap. Interval body temperatures were recorded to characterize temperature progression from onset of rewarming to arrival in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) and were compared with the temperature progression of a similar group of nonparticipants. Adverse events were recorded on the basis of perioperative body temperatures and skin assessments. RESULTS: The head wrap was easily applied to the infant's head and was removed without difficulty. A steady increase in median body temperature from (1) the onset of rewarming (28 degrees C), to (2) removal of bypass cannulas (28.9 degrees C), to (3) removal of the rectal temperature probe before transfer from the operating room to the cardiac ICU (34.5 degrees C), and (4) upon arrival in the cardiac ICU (36.0 degrees C) was observed. No skin lesions or temperature-related adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The newly designed Heat Retention Head Wrap was associated with a gradual normalization of temperature during rewarming and did not interfere with routine perioperative care of infants undergoing bypass surgery. This pilot study indicates that the head wrap is both safe and feasible for use in infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.",

Our objective was to develop a comprehensive algorithm to convert all types of effect measures to one standard metric, relative risk reduction (RRR). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This work was conducted to facilitate synthesis of published intervention effects for our epidemic modeling of the health impact of human immunodeficiency virus [HIV testing and counseling (HTC)]. We designed and implemented an algorithm to transform varied effect measures to RRR, representing the proportionate reduction in undesirable outcomes. RESULTS: Our extraction of 55 HTC studies identified 473 effect measures representing unique combinations of intervention-outcome-population characteristics, using five outcome metrics: pre-post proportion (70.6%), odds ratio (14.0%), mean difference (10.2%), risk ratio (4.4%), and RRR (0.9%). Outcomes were expressed as both desirable (29.5%, eg, consistent condom use) and undesirable (70.5%, eg, inconsistent condom use). Using four examples, we demonstrate our algorithm for converting varied effect measures to RRR and provide the conceptual basis for advantages of RRR over other metrics. CONCLUSION: Our review of the literature suggests that RRR, an easily understood and useful metric to convey risk reduction associated with an intervention, is underused by original and review studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) development in Sjogren's syndrome (SS) remains a potentially lethal complication and efforts should focus on the identification of predictors that could aid in appropriate therapeutic decisions. METHODS: In order to identify potential prognostic factors for outcome in SS-associated NHL, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 77 patients, diagnosed with NHL according to WHO classification criteria and meeting the American-European Consensus Classification (AECC) criteria for SS and examined the effect of SS-activity (defined as the EULAR SS disease activity index-ESSDAI) in the prognosis of SS-related NHLs, as defined in terms of overall and event-free survivals (OS and EFS). An event was defined as lymphoma relapse, treatment failure, disease progression, histological transformation or death. The effect of NHL clinical and laboratory characteristics was also investigated. RESULTS: MALT lymphomas constituted the majority (66.2%) of lymphomas. During the follow-up (median = 57.93 months), the 5-year OS was 90.91% (95% CI: 82.14-95.80%) and the EFS was 77.92% (95% CI: 67.37-85.82%). Patients with high ESSDAI score at lymphoma diagnosis had a greater risk for death (OR = 5.241, 95% CI: 1.034-26.568) or for event (OR = 4.317, 95% CI: 1.146-9.699, p = 0.008). These patients had also significantly worse EFS (HR = 4.541, 95% CI: 1.772-11.637) and OS (HR = 5.946, 95% CI: 1.259-28.077). In addition, post-chemotherapy ESSDAI improvement was significantly lower in patients who had experienced an event (p = 0.005). An unfavorable International prognostic index (IPI) score (high-intermediate/high) was associated with high risk of death and event (OR = 13.867, 95% CI: 2.656-72.387 and OR = 12.589, 95% CI: 3.911-40.526, respectively), worse EFS (log-rank p<0.001, HR = 8.718, 95% CI: 3.477-21.858), as well as with worse OS (log-rank p<0.001, HR = 11.414, 95% CI: 2.414-53.974). After adjustment for identified risk factors, IPI score retained a significant prognostic role following by a strong effect of ESSDAI in survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: At the point of NHL diagnosis, IPI and ESSDAI might be proved useful predictive tools in SS-associated lymphoma prognosis, directing to a more patient-tailored approach.",

In addition, repeated measurements are common in clinical practice for tracking and monitoring the progression of complex diseases. Classical methodology based on statistical inference, in particular, ordinal modeling has contributed to the analysis of data in which the response categories are ordered and the number of covariates (p) remains smaller than the sample size (n). With the emergence of genomic technologies being increasingly applied for more accurate diagnosis and prognosis, high-dimensional data where the number of covariates (p) is much larger than the number of samples (n), are generated. To meet the emerging needs, we introduce our proposed model which is a two-stage algorithm: Extend the generalized monotone incremental forward stagewise (GMIFS) method to the cumulative logit ordinal model; and combine the GMIFS procedure with the classical mixed-effects model for classifying disease status in disease progression along with time. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed models in classification using a time-course microarray dataset collected from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury study.",

We conducted this study to explore the clinical, radiological, and hormonal phenotype and responses to therapy in patients with X-LAG syndrome. The study included 18 patients (13 sporadic) with X-LAG and microduplication of chromosome Xq26.3. All sporadic cases had unique duplications and the inheritance pattern in two families was dominant, with all Xq26.3 duplication carriers being affected. Patients began to grow rapidly as early as 2-3 months of age (median 12 months). At diagnosis (median delay 27 months), patients had a median height and weight standard deviation scores (SDS) of >+3.9 SDS. Apart from the increased overall body size, the children had acromegalic symptoms including acral enlargement and facial coarsening. More than a third of cases had increased appetite. Patients had marked hypersecretion of GH/IGF1 and usually prolactin, due to a pituitary macroadenoma or hyperplasia. Primary neurosurgical control was achieved with extensive anterior pituitary resection, but postoperative hypopituitarism was frequent. Control with somatostatin analogs was not readily achieved despite moderate to high levels of expression of somatostatin receptor subtype-2 in tumor tissue. Postoperative use of adjuvant pegvisomant resulted in control of IGF1 in all five cases where it was employed. X-LAG is a new infant-onset gigantism syndrome that has a severe clinical phenotype leading to challenging disease management.",

        "abstract": "Polymorphisms at the rs10994336 and rs9804190 loci of the Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) gene have been strongly associated with increased risk for bipolar disorder (BD). However, their potential pathogenetic effect on BD-relevant neural circuits remains unknown. We examined the effect of BD-risk polymorphisms at rs10994336 and rs9804190 on the working memory (WM) circuit using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained from euthymic patients with BD (n = 41), their psychiatrically healthy first-degree relatives (n = 25) and unrelated individuals without personal or family history of psychiatric disorders (n = 46) while performing the N-back task. In unrelated healthy individuals, the rs10994336-risk-allele was associated with reduced activation of the ventral visual cortical components of the WM circuit while the rs9804190-risk-allele was associated with inefficient hyperactivation of the prefrontal cortical components of the WM. In patients and their healthy relatives, risk alleles at either loci were associated with hyperactivation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, Rs9804190-risk-allele carriers with BD evidenced abnormal hyperactivation within the posterior cingulate cortex. This study provides new insights on the neurogenetic correlates of allelic variation at different genome-wide supported BD-risk associated ANK3 loci that support their involvement in BD and highlight the modulatory influence of increased background genetic risk for BD.",

        "abstract": "Urinary schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Shistosoma haematobium. It is prevalent in several parts of Africa particularly in areas where there are large water bodies. In most affected communities, the condition is often accepted as normal since to them, all growing children pass blood in their urine and \"grow out of it\". Mass treatment of school children has been a regular exercise often undertaken by stake holders to decrease the disease burden and reduce transmission in selected communities. Urinary schistosomiasis can have devastating impact on the urinary tract which is often unacknowledged and unevaluated. Such omission could have implication for progressive renal damage which, if not detected and treated, could lead to end stage renal failure and death. We present five (5) cases of urinary schistosomiasis with severe obstructive uropathy seen at the paediatric nephrology/urology units of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Ghana. All five cases had some degree of anaemia and hypertension. Two of the five cases presented with end stage renal failure and died subsequently whilst two underwent successful surgery. One made a spontaneous recovery from the urinary obstruction though still has significant renal impairment. This potential devastating effect of urinary schistosomiasis on the kidneys calls for thorough evaluation and assessment of each confirmed case to include blood pressure measurement, full blood count, and ultrasonography of the urinary system. Mass screening programmes should be combined with portable ultrasonography of the kidneys, ureters and bladder.",

Little is known about these functional architectural changes, particularly during the second half of the first year of life. We used multivariate pattern classification of resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data obtained in an on-going, multi-site, longitudinal study of brain and behavioral development to explore whether fcMRI data contained information sufficient to classify infant age. Analyses carefully account for the effects of fcMRI motion artifact. Support vector machines (SVMs) classified 6 versus 12 month-old infants (128 datasets) above chance based on fcMRI data alone. Results demonstrate significant changes in measures of brain functional organization that coincide with a special period of dramatic change in infant motor, cognitive, and social development. Explorations of the most different correlations used for SVM lead to two different interpretations about functional connections that support 6 versus 12-month age categorization.",

        "abstract": "Adelphophagy occurs when encapsulated embryos complete development by feeding on their developing siblings, which are known as nutritive embryos. Nutritive embryos are found in a variety of animal groups, and are especially common in some groups of marine invertebrates. Although they have evolved numerous times independently in the calyptraeid gastropods, adelphophagic development with nutritive embryos has not been described in detail. Using light microscopy and time-lapse imaging of laboratory-reared embryos, we describe the development of Crepidula navicella, a direct developer with nutritive embryos that cleave and gastrulate. Early stages of nutritive and viable embryos do not show any obvious morphological differences, but do show asynchrony in early cleavage among embryos from the same capsule. We discovered that two classes of nutritive embryos are produced; gastrula-like nutritive embryos, which arrest after gastrulation, and post-gastrula-like nutritive embryos that are more variable in morphology, and show evidence of minor differentiation. This study provides a framework for future research on the developmental and molecular mechanisms of nutritive embryo development of C. navicella, which will allow us to address the role of nutritive embryos in the origins of developmental polyphenisms. Careful description of the developmental sequence is necessary before adaptive hypotheses can be addressed, and comparisons with other taxa can be made. Understanding the different ways that embryos and their development are disrupted to produce nutritive embryos will provide important insights into the normal process of development.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: With pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) incidence increasing and patients freely choosing their surgeon, patients' interest issues have been brought forward estimating patient satisfaction following pilonidal sinus surgery. The influence of wound healing time and long-term recurrence rate on patient satisfaction in primary PSD surgery has not been investigated yet. METHODS: Five hundred eighty-three patients (German military cohort) were interviewed, compiling wound healing time, aesthetic satisfaction, long-term recurrence-free survival and patient satisfaction having undergone primary open (PO) treatment, marsupialization (MARS) or primary midline closure (PMC) treatment. Recurrence rate was determined by Kaplan-Meier calculation following up to 20 years after primary PSD surgery. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction ranking from 1 to 10 (10 = max. satisfied) showed an average satisfaction of 8.2 (range 0-10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7891-8250). In-hospital stay time was significantly longer in primary open (PO) and marsupialization (MARS) group as compared to primary midline closure (PMC; p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Satisfaction was comparable between treatment groups, and was neither linked to in-hospital stay time nor to longer outpatient wound care period or total treatment time. Recurrence-free survival, as seen in the PO and PMC treatment group, revealed a highly significant difference for all patients. Improvement in MARS patients with versus without recurrence was low, as satisfaction with primary treatment was lower as the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neither choice of surgical treatment nor treatment duration within hospital or after hospital influences patient satisfaction, as long as recurrence-free survival can be provided. Marsupialization was ranked lower in both groups (with or without recurrence), and should be abandoned, as patients are significantly less satisfied with either results, independent of recurrence.",

This post-nature which aspires to be perfect, immortal, invulnerable, is entirely devoid of beauty. In fact, while there may be an aesthetic of the artificial and of the artefact if it is in relation to objects, there is, however, no aesthetic of the post-human body. This is because is configured as a non-body and does not have the characteristics for what is commonly intended as beauty (harmony between matter and form, a reflection of inner life, uniqueness). Also in this case, it is more correct to speak of post-beauty, which in its properties appears to be the mirror image of beauty and ultimately, represents its complete dissolution.",

The aim was to identify schools where levels of water fluoride appeared to be below dental health thresholds (0.5-1.0 mg/L) as recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The objective is to provide health organizations with the knowledge for a more targeted approach to schools with greater risk of decay. METHODS: Population data, school location, enrolment data and water quality data were integrated into geographic databases for analysis using Quantum GIS, Lisboa 1.8. RESULTS: The results indicated that 46% of school attendees in the northern half of Western Australia were at schools where there was the potential that the water was not dentally optimally fluoridated while in the southern half of Western Australia this was about 10%. Of these attendees (north and south), 45% were at primary school. Similarly, there was an association between socio-economic decile and proportion of school attendees in non-dentally optimally fluoridated schools. Lower deciles (i.e. poorer attendees) had a greater risk of being in schools outside dentally optimally fluoridated areas. CONCLUSIONS: This study clearly highlights areas where more prevention (and probably) treatment needs are present and provides a framework for targeted service planning.",

METHODS: Eligible publications were retrieved according to inclusion/exclusion criteria and the data were analyzed using the Review Manager software (V5.2). RESULTS: A meta-analysis based on 51 case-control studies consisting of 16774 cases and 32060 controls was performed to evaluate the association between the ALDH2 Glu504Lys polymorphism and cancer risk. The comparison of genotypes Lys+ (Lys/Lys and Lys/Glu) with Glu/Glu yielded a significant 20% increased cancer risk (OR = 1.20, 95%CI: 1.03-1.39, P = 0.02, I2 = 92%). Subgroup analysis by cancer type indicated a significantly increased UADT cancer risk (OR = 1.39, 95%CI: 1.11-1.73, P = 0.004, I2 = 94%) in individuals with the Lys+ genotypes. Subgroup analysis by country indicated that individuals from Japan with the Lys+ genotypes had a significant 38% increased cancer risk (OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.12-1.71, P = 0.003, I2 = 93%).

METHODS: Bacterial DNA was extracted from reposited cervicovaginal lavage samples collected annually over an 8-10 year period from Chicago Women's Interagency HIV Study participants: 22 HIV-negative, 22 HIV-positive with stable infection, 20 HIV-positive with progressive infection. The vaginal microbiota was defined by pyrosequencing of the V1/V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Scheduled visits included Bacterial vaginsosis (BV) screening; clinically detected cases were referred for treatment. Hierarchical clustering identified bacterial community state types (CST). Multinomial mixed effects modeling determined trends over time in CST, by HIV status and other factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 8.1 years (range 5.5-15.3). Six CSTs were identified. The mean relative abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus spp. by CST (with median number of bacterial taxa) was: CST-1-25.7% (10), CST-2-27.1% (11), CST-3-34.6% (9), CST-4-46.8% (9), CST-5-57.9% (4), CST-6-69.4% (2). The two CSTs representing the highest RA of Lactobacillus and lowest diversity increased with each additional year of follow-up (CST-5, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.62 [95% CI: 1.34-1.94]; CST-6, aOR = 1.57 [95 CI: 1.31-1.89]), while the two CSTs representing lowest RA of Lactobacillus and higher diversity decreased with each additional year (CST-1, aOR = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.80-1.00]; CST-2, aOR = 0.86 [95% CI: 0.75-0.99]). There was no association between HIV status and CST at baseline or over time. CSTs representing lower RA of Lactobacillus were associated with current cigarette smoking.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluated the results of external bone transport, which was applied to 11 patients with traumatic bone loss who had not completed their bone development. METHODS: The average age of the 9 male and 2 female patients was 10.6 (range, 8 to 16) years. Eight of the defects were located in the tibia, whereas the other 3 were in the femur. The average defect was 5.4 (range, 4.5 to 8.5) cm. External bone transport was applied in the early period in 7 patients, whereas in 4 patients it was performed due to nonunion. Bifocal osteosynthesis and single osteotomy were performed in 2 patients with type B2 nonunion. Compression to the nonunion region and lengthening in the osteotomy region were applied. In 2 patients with type B1 nonunion, and the other 9 patients who had external bone transport, the gap was eliminated by bifocal osteosynthesis, single osteotomy, and bone transport to the osteotomy line. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21 (range, 13 to 48) months. Complete union was achieved in all patients without any bone operation or graft application. No refracture was observed after the removal of the external fixator, and the average hospitalization time was 16 (range, 7 to 65) days. The average external fixation time was 4.2 (range, 3.5 to 5.5) months, and the mean external fixator index was 0.8 months (23 d/cm). The mean bone healing time was 5.1 (range, 4.6 to 6) months. CONCLUSIONS: To initially consider the open fractures with true or in situ bone loss in children as \"anticipated nonunion,\" and determine the treatment strategies regarding this fact, may prevent nonunion and shorten the healing period. Bone transport in the treatment of traumatic bone defects in children is an easy biological procedure, with lower complications but higher success ratios. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-therapeutic.",

        "abstract": "Despite an increasing attention and public preference for rural amenities, little evidence is available on the health benefits of a rural environment. In this study, we identified physiological and psychological benefits of exposure to a rural environment using multiparametric methods. Twelve young male adults participated in a 3-day field experiment (mean +/- standard deviation age, 22.3 +/- 1.3 years). Sleeping environment, diet program, physical activities, and other factors possibly affecting physiological responses were controlled during experiment period. For all participants, salivary cortisol concentration, heart rate variability, and blood pressure were measured at rural and urban field sites. Self-evaluation questionnaires were administered to analyze the psychological states in two different environments. Volatile compounds in the air were also analyzed to investigate air quality. The data were compared between rural and urban environments. The data showed that exposure to a rural environment reduced stress hormone secretion and sympathetic nervous activity and increased parasympathetic nervous activity. Short-term exposure to a rural environment also improved mood states. Our findings indicate that exposure to a rural environment effectively reduced physiological stress and enhanced psychological well-being.",

Here, we describe a novel two-gene cluster that comprises duplicated cyanase and carbonic anhydrase copies, which we name the CCA gene cluster, trace its evolution across Ascomycetes, and examine the evolutionary dynamics of its spread among lineages of the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (hereafter referred to as the FOSC), a cosmopolitan clade of purportedly clonal vascular wilt plant pathogens. Phylogenetic analysis of fungal cyanase and carbonic anhydrase genes reveals that the CCA gene cluster arose independently at least twice and is now present in three lineages, namely Cochliobolus lunatus, Oidiodendron maius, and the FOSC. Genome-wide surveys within the FOSC indicate that the CCA gene cluster varies in copy number across isolates, is always located on accessory chromosomes, and is absent in FOSC's closest relatives. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the CCA gene cluster in 163 FOSC strains from a wide variety of hosts suggests a recent history of rampant transfers between isolates. We hypothesize that the independent formation of the CCA gene cluster in different fungal lineages and its spread across FOSC strains may be associated with resistance to plant-produced cyanates or to use of cyanate fungicides in agriculture.",

It comprises not only neoplastic cells, but also other resident cells within the milieu such as stroma and vascular cells in addition to a variable cellular infiltrate from the periphery. A host of soluble factors such as growth factors, chemokines, eicosanoids soluble metabolites and extracellular matrix components have been extensively documented as factors which modulate this environment. However, in recent years there has also been growing interests in the potential roles of extracellular vesicles (EV) in many of the processes governing the nature of cancerous tissue. In this brief review, we have assembled evidence describing several distinct functions for extracellular vesicles in modulating the microenvironment with examples that include immune evasion, angiogenesis and stromal activation. Whilst there remains a great deal to be learnt about the interplay between vesicles and the cancerous environment, it is becoming clear that vesicle-mediated communication has a major influence on key aspects of cancer growth and progression. We conclude that the design of future therapeutics should acknowledge the existence and roles of extracellular vesicles, and seriously consider strategies for circumventing their effects in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The parasitic dinoflagellates in the genus of Hematodinium infect broad range of crustaceans around the world, causing fatal diseases in multiple species of wild and cultured crabs and subsequent economic loss. In order to explore this host-parasite interaction in the early development stage of infection, mRNA transcript levels of eight key immune-related genes, including LGBP, proPO, PPAF, serpin, alpha2m, and three PTcSPs were quantitatively assessed in Portunus trituberculatus artificially inoculated with the Hematodinium parasites. The fluctuation of proPO gene expression indicated that the host proPO system was disturbed overtly due to the intrusion of the parasites. And as manifested by the suppressed expression of LGBP and PPAF, an immunosuppressive mechanism was likely induced by the parasites against being entrapped or killed by the host proPO system. Furthermore, the significant variations of the transcript levels of serpin, alpha2m, and the three PTcSPs suggested that the parasites affected the proteinase cascade reactions associated with the immune response by destroying the balance between serine proteinases and the proteinase inhibitors. The hemocytes counts and PO activity varied accordingly over the time course of infection, showing that hemocytes were actively involved in the immune response against the parasitic invasion. This study primarily highlighted the anti-parasitic immune response of crab hosts, and presented the first report of the immune response of P. trituberculatus to the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium.",

The EU Framework program 7 project ChemScreen aimed to fill this gap in a pragmatic manner preferably using validated existing tools and place them in an innovative alternative testing strategy. In our approach we combined knowledge on critical processes affected by reproductive toxicants with knowledge on the mechanistic basis of such effects. We used in silico methods for prescreening chemicals for relevant toxic effects aiming at reduced testing needs. For those chemicals that need testing we have set up an in vitro screening panel that includes mechanistic high throughput methods and lower throughput assays that measure more integrative endpoints. In silico pharmacokinetic modules were developed for rapid exposure predictions via diverse exposure routes. These modules to match in vitro and in vivo exposure levels greatly improved predictivity of the in vitro tests. As a further step, we have generated examples how to predict reproductive toxicity of chemicals using available data. We have executed formal validations of panel constituents and also used more innovative manners to validate the test panel using mechanistic approaches. We are actively engaged in promoting regulatory acceptance of the tools developed as an essential step towards practical application, including case studies for read-across purposes. With this approach, a significant saving in animal use and associated costs seems very feasible.",

        "abstract": "The small intestine is a convoluted flexible tube of inconstant form and capacity through which chyme is propelled and mixed by varying patterns of contraction. These inconstancies have prevented quantitative comparisons of the manner in which contractile activity engenders mixing of contained chyme. Recent quantitative work based on spatiotemporal mapping of intestinal contractions, macro- and micro-rheology, particle image velocimetry and real-time modelling has provided new insights into this process. Evidence indicates that the speeds and patterns of the various types of small intestinal contraction are insufficient to secure optimal mixing and enzymatic digestion over a minimal length of intestine. Hence particulate substrates and soluble nutrients become dispersed along the length of the lumen. Mixing within the lumen is not turbulent but results from localised folding and kneading of the contents by contractions but is augmented by the inconstant spatial disposition of the contractions and their component contractile processes. The latter include inconstancies in the sites of commencement and the directions of propagation of contraction in component groups of smooth muscle cells and in the coordination of the radial and circular components of smooth muscle contraction. Evidence suggests there is ongoing augmentation of mixing at the periphery of the lumen, during both the post-prandial and inter-meal periods, to promote flow around and between adjacent villi. This results largely from folding of the relatively inelastic mucosa during repeated radial and longitudinal muscular contraction, causing chyme to be displaced by periodic crowding and separation of the tips of the relatively rigid villi. Further, micro-rheological studies indicate that such peripheral mixing may extend to the apices of enterocytes owing to discontinuities in the mobile mucus layer that covers the ileal mucosa.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic treatment of low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) via office-based fulguration vs operating room-based transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was created to simulate and compare the economic burden of managing patients with office-based fulguration vs TURB. Direct procedural and hospitalization costs were queried from our institution. Patients were modeled as being followed up routinely with flexible cystoscopy, whereas tumor recurrences were treated with either fulguration or TURB. RESULTS: A strategy of office-based fulguration was more cost-effective than TURB ($1171 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] vs. $1208 per QALY) to treat recurrent NMIBC over a 5-year period. Fulguration was both more effective (14.94 vs. 14.91 QALYs) as well as less expensive ($17,494 vs. $18,005), thus dominating TURB. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$18,440 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the relative costs of the procedures are more significant in determining cost-effectiveness than their respective utilities. CONCLUSION: Office-based cystoscopy and fulguration was more cost-effective than TURB for treating recurrent low-risk NMIBC. Adherence to an office-based treatment plan can lead to significant cost savings with a decreased therapeutic burden over the lifetime of a patient with NMIBC.",

We show in this paper that for linear optical spectra (absorption, circular dichroism), no stochastics is needed, even for finite temperatures.

Chronic inflammatory signaling in the colon increases the risk of colorectal cancer, so we sought to evaluate the role of TNF-alpha in a mouse model of this condition. METHODS: TNF mice were treated with azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium to induce inflammation and tumorigenesis. Etanercept was used to produce pharmacological ablation of TNF-alpha in wild-type mice. Subsequent activation of procarcinogenic transcription factor NF-kappaB and relevant proinflammatory cytokines of the TNF superfamily were measured through immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: Results showed that the severity of colitis, as assessed by mortality, histological scoring, and cytokine expression levels, was similar or slightly higher in mice lacking TNF-alpha than in control mice. Activation levels of NF-kappaB were not influenced by the presence of TNF-alpha. We also observed upregulated expression of TNF family member TNF-beta, TNF receptors 1 and 2 and a variety of other proinflammatory factors in colitis-associated tumors of TNF mice, compared with levels in tumors of control mice. Neither genetic ablation of TNF-alpha nor pharmacological inhibition of the TNF family using etanercept reduced tumor number. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a redundant role for TNF-alpha in a mouse model of colitis-associated tumorigenesis, indicating a high degree of redundancy in proinflammatory cytokine networks in this model.",

Although variable, the most common pattern found was SBRN innervation to the dorsal surface of the lateral 2(1/2) digits and DBUN innervation to the dorsal surface of the medial 2(1/2) digits. Dual innervation due to communicating branches or nerves overlapping was found in 41 cases. All-radial supply to the dorsum of the hand was found in ten cases. The LABCN was closely associated, and occasionally overlapped, with the SBRN. There were significant differences in the sensory distribution of the dorsum of the right and left hands of the same cadaver. The sensory distribution in the dorsum of the hand is variable; however, understanding the most common innervation pattern and appreciating the possible variations to this pattern is important to avoid errors in interpretation of conduction velocity studies, misdiagnosis of nerve pathology signs and symptoms and inappropriate treatments.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the current literature regarding congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) to promote the most effective and evidence-based intervention. CMT is a musculoskeletal deformity observed at birth or in infancy, characterized by persistent head tilt toward the ipsilateral side with the chin rotated toward the contralateral side. The incidence of torticollis is on the rise and as a result there has been a surge in the literature on the topic, however, until recently, there was little consensus on the treatment approach. RECENT FINDINGS: Research on CMT has gone in several directions. One branch is looking at diagnostics, imaging, and attempting to understand the underlying disease behind torticollis, down to the cellular level. This information may be helpful in the other, more clinical research vein to determine prognosis, establish plan of care, and create guidelines for the treatment of infants with torticollis. SUMMARY: CMT presents as a muscular imbalance. We know from the pediatric and adult literature, whether it is about cerebral palsy or anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, that muscle imbalances can lead to skeletal changes, postural dysfunction, and impaired movement patterns. These can lead to functional limitations and limitations in participation. CMT, therefore, needs to be addressed. Although this article presents the current evidence and guidelines for treatment, there is still much to be learned regarding disease, optimal intervention, duration of treatment, and timing of follow-up.

These neuropeptides induce activation of thymus cells receptors and influence on the main processes in thymus, including T-lymphocyte maturation, cytokine and hormones production. In turn, thymuspeptides and/or cytokines, controlled by them, enter the brain and exert influence on neuro- nalfunction, which creates the basis for changes of behavior and homeostasis maintenance in response to infection. Ageing and some infectious, autoimmune, neurodegenerative and cancer diseases are accompanied by distortion of interactions between thymus and central nervous system. Mechanisms of signaling pathways, which determine these interactions, are not revealed yet, and their understanding will promote the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

We derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the average delivery rate as a function of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), SBS density, target file bitrate, storage size, file length, and file popularity. We then analyze the impact of key operating parameters on the system performance. It is shown that a certain outage probability can be achieved either by increasing the number of base stations or the total storage size. Our results and analysis provide key insights into the deployment of cache-enabled small cell networks (SCNs), which are seen as a promising solution for future heterogeneous cellular networks.",

Intra-uterine exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is associated with increased risks of growth and neurodevelopmental problems during childhood and later life. Few studies have focussed on visual difficulties in children in the context of maternal smoking during pregnancy. A systematic search of online databases was carried out between February and May 2013 to examine the trend in visual outcomes in children exposed to maternal cigarette smoking during intra-uterine life. Twenty-four non-randomized studies were identified. Each study was rated for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Most studies (n = 18) reported fetal exposure to active or passive maternal cigarette smoking to be associated with an increased risk of adverse visual outcomes in children. In particular, there were higher rates of strabismus, refractive errors and retinopathy among children of women who smoked during pregnancy. These findings suggest that fetal exposure to cigarette smoke is a significant risk factor for visual problems during later life and that certain visual faculties, such as the intraocular muscles and retinal neurons, are more affected than others. The findings provide evidence in support of public health policies aimed at reducing fetal exposure to smoking by advising both women and their partners to quit smoking during pregnancy.",

We examined the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors (RFs) and prevalence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis in a large, prospective, multinational registry of consecutive young individuals undergoing coronary computerized tomographic angiography (CCTA). METHOD AND RESULTS: Of 27 125 patients undergoing CCTA, 1635 young (<45 years) individuals without known coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary anomalies were identified. Coronary plaque was assessed for any CAD, obstructive CAD (>/=50% stenosis), and presence of calcified plaque (CP) and non-calcified plaque (NCP). Among 1635 subjects (70% men, age 38 +/- 6 years), any CAD, obstructive CAD, CP, and NCP were observed in 19, 4, 5, and 8%, respectively. Compared with women, men demonstrated higher rates of any CAD (21 vs. 12%, P < 0.001), CP (6 vs. 3%, P = 0.01), and NCP (9 vs. 5%, P = 0.008), although no difference was observed for rates of obstructive CAD (5 vs. 4%, P = 0.46). Any CAD, obstructive CAD, and NCP were higher for young individuals with diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, current smoking, or family history of CAD; while only diabetes and dyslipidaemia were associated with CP. Increasing cardiovascular RFs was associated with a greater prevalence and extent and severity of CAD, with individuals with 0, 1, 2, >/=3 RFs manifesting a dose-response increase in any CAD (P < 0.001, for trend), obstructive CAD (P < 0.001, for trend), NCP (P < 0.001, for trend), and CP (P < 0.001, for trend). In multivariable analysis adjusting for sex and cardiovascular RFs, male sex was the strongest predictor for any CAD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43-2.66, P < 0.001), CP (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.08-1.98, P = 0.01), and NCP (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.06-1.67, P = 0.01); family history of CAD was the strongest predictor for obstructive CAD (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.65-4.45, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Any and obstructive CAD is present in 1 in 5 and 1 in 20 young individuals, respectively, with family history associated with the greatest risk of obstructive CAD.",

The purpose of this study was to review our experience using CAD/CAM concepts in periorbital osteotomies. Three complex periorbital osteotomies were planned and performed: 1 case of bilateral vertical and horizontal orbital dystopia, 1 case of a Monobloc-Le Fort II in an Apert patient, and 1 case of recurrent hypertelorism in a patient with craniofrontal nasal dysplasia. The patients' charts were reviewed, including photographs, medical records, and CAD/CAM plans. The CAD/CAM planning sessions were held 3 to 6 weeks preoperatively and lasted approximately 1 hour. Both cutting guides and positioning guides were used, translating to significant precision of both the osteotomy as well as the final position of the orbits. Qualitatively, the cutting and positioning guides were easy to use and improved operating room efficiency. To conclude, in our hands, CAD/CAM virtual surgical planning is safe and effective in the performance of complex periorbital osteotomies. More work is needed to more clearly define surgical indications for this costly, new technology.",

METHODS: We therefore sought to examine these relationships with 95 high-risk youth (ages 14-18; M age = 16.29 years). We examined blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to an fMRI-based cognitive task designed to assess response inhibition (Go/NoGo) and past month risk behavior (number of substance use days; number of unprotected sex days). RESULTS: For this sample of youth, we found significant negative correlations between past month substance use and response inhibition within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right insula (uncorrected p < .001; extent threshold >/= 10 voxels). In addition, in the same contrast, we found significant positive correlations between past month risky sex and activation within the right IFG and left middle occipital gyrus (uncorrected p < .001; extent threshold >/= 10 voxels). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the particular relevance of these regions in this compelling, albeit slightly different, pattern of response for adolescent risky behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans family, exists and plays multifunctional roles in stromal and epithelial cells. Emerging evidences showed that decorin is dysregulated expression in a wide variety of human tumors and affects a broad biology process of cancer cells, including growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Recent studies demonstrated that decorin could affect A549 proliferation though decreasing TGF-beta1, cycling D1 expression and increasing P53 and P21 expression. However, limited data are available on the effect of decorin on metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and how decorin impacts metastasis is still unknown. In this study, we identified decorin mRNA expression through Oncomine database and verified the expression of decorin mRNA and protein in 50 patients who underwent primary surgical resection of a NSCLC in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, China, between September 2013 and March 2014 by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Also, the correlationship between decorin and the NSCLC patients' clinical characteristics or survival ( www.kmplot.com ) was analyzed. Via ectopic expression analyses and Western blot, the roles of decorin in proliferation, metastasis, and the underline mechanism for decorin expression were further explored. We found that decorin was downregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with the adjacent normal lung tissues or normal tissues. Additionally, the expression of decorin was correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, and prognosis. We also showed that overexpression of decorin could inhibit NSCLC cell lines proliferation and metastasis. Through Western blot analysis, we identified that E-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are two key factors responsible for the growth arrest and metastasis inhibition induced by decorin in NSCLC. Our results indicated that decorin plays crucial roles in NSCLC against carcinogenesis and progression. Decorin might be a predictive factor and an attractive therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.",

As yet, few large-scale studies are available that report on the characteristics and representativeness of the sample obtained from such recruitment methods. OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to describe the sociodemographic and health characteristics of a national sample of young Australian women recruited mainly through the Internet and social networking sites and to discuss the representativeness of their sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle characteristics relative to the population. METHODS: A cohort of 17,069 women (born between 1989 and 1995) was recruited in 2012-13 for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Sociodemographic characteristics (percentages, means, and 95% confidence intervals) from the online survey data were compared with women aged 18-23 years from the 2011 Australian Census. Sample data were compared by age and education level with data from the 2011-13 Australian Health Survey (AHS). RESULTS: Compared to the Australian Census data, study participants were broadly representative in terms of geographical distribution across Australia, marital status (95.62%, 16,321/17,069) were never married), and age distribution. A higher percentage had attained university (22.52%, 3844/17,069) and trade/certificate/diploma qualifications (25.94%, 4428/17,069) compared with this age group of women in the national population (9.4% and 21.7% respectively). Among study participants, 22.05% (3721/16,877) were not in paid employment with 35.18% (5931/16,857) studying 16 or more hours a week. A higher percentage of study participants rated their health in the online survey as fair or poor (rather than good, very good, or excellent) compared with those participating in face-to-face interviews in the AHS (18.77%, 3203/17,069 vs 10.1%). A higher percentage of study participants were current smokers (21.78%, 3718/17,069 vs 16.4%) and physically active (59.30%, 10,089/17,014 were classified as sufficiently active vs 48.3%) but alcohol consumption was lower (59.58%, 9865/16,558 reported drinking alcohol at least once per month vs 65.9% in the AHS). Using self-reported height and weight to determine body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), 34.80% (5901/16,956) of the cohort were classified as overweight or obese (BMI of 25 or more), compared with 33.6% respectively using measured height and weight in the AHS. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that using the Internet and social networking sites for an online survey represent a feasible recruitment strategy for a national cohort of young women and result in a broadly representative sample of the Australian population.",

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study quantified CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in plasma of 886 women at  approximately 28 weeks gestation and calculated GWG rate (kg/week) from blood draw to delivery. At  approximately 3 years post-partum, CRP and IL-6 were assessed from 351 women and weight and WC were measured at 3 and 7 years post-partum. This study used linear regression to investigate the relationship between mid-pregnancy inflammation and subsequent GWG rate and the association of inflammation at 3 years post-partum with weight and WC change during follow-up. RESULTS: After accounting for confounders, a small dose-response association of mid-gestation CRP with subsequent GWG was observed; women in the 4th CRP quartile gained weight at 0.05 (95% CI = 0.01, 0.10) kg/week faster than those in the 1st quartile. Neither IL-6 nor TNF-alpha was related to GWG. Post-partum inflammation was not associated with subsequent weight or WC gain. CONCLUSIONS: Higher mid-gestation CRP was related to modestly higher subsequent GWG rate. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of maternal obesity on pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 298 postpartum women. Information was obtained through interviews and access to patients' medical records. The patients were divided into three groups according to their pre-gestational body mass index: normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (>/=30.0 kg/m2). Data are reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) following multinomial logistic regression analysis to account for confounding variables. RESULTS: Compared to pregnant women with normal body mass index, overweight women had greater chances of having cesarean delivery, odds ratio (OR) of 2.2 and 95%CI 1.3-3.9, and obese women even more (OR=4.2; 95%CI 2.1-8.1). The chances of gestational diabetes increased in the Overweight (OR=2.5; 95%CI 1.1-5.6) and Obese groups (OR=11.1; 95%CI 5.0-24.6). The occurrence of hypertensive syndrome was also higher in overweight (OR=3.2; 95%CI 1.2-8.1) and obese pregnant women (OR=7.5; 95%CI 2.9-19.1). Major postpartum hemorrhage only showed greater values in the obese women group (OR=4.1; 95%CI 1.1-15.8). Regarding the newborns, the probability of a low Apgar score at first minute was higher in the Obese Group (OR=5.5; 95%CI 1.2-23.7) and chances of macrosomia were higher in the Overweight Group (OR=2.9; 95%CI 1.3-6.3). Data regarding neonatal hypoglycemia were not conclusive. CONCLUSION: Excessive weight (overweight and obesity) during pregnancy increases the chance of maternal complications (gestational diabetes, hypertensive syndrome, and major postpartum hemorrhage) and neonatal outcomes (cesarean delivery, macrosomia, and low Apgar score).",

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 131 eyes of 131 patients exhibiting filtering blebs were examined. Of those, 20 eyes were excluded as flat-shaped, non-functioning bleb. Transconjunctival oozing was defined as transconjunctival aqueous egress evident on the bleb surface, in the absence of any point leak observable using a slit-lamp, as confirmed by application of digital pressure. Total bleb height, the height of the fluid-filled cavity, and bleb wall thickness and density were measured using 3D AS-OCT. Patient age, the etiology of glaucoma, postoperative follow-up period, number of glaucoma medication classes prescribed, intraocular pressure (IOP), grade of bleb vascularity, and bleb parameters were compared in eyes with and without bleb oozing. RESULTS: Sixty (54.0 %) of 111 eyes excluding non-functioning flat blebs exhibited oozing; mean IOP value (11.7 +/- 4.5 vs. 14.8 +/- 4.0 mmHg) and bleb vascularity grade (1.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.0) were lower than those of eyes without oozing. Total bleb height (1.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.4 mm), bleb wall thickness (0.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.3 mm), and bleb wall density (131.3 +/- 45.7 vs. 180.9 +/- 39.8 optical density units) differed significantly between the two groups (oozing vs. non-oozing). CONCLUSION: Transconjunctival oozing after trabeculectomy with MMC was associated with a low IOP, low-level bleb vascularity, an elevated total bleb height, a thicker bleb wall, and low bleb wall density.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant trials conducted using a double HER2 blockade with lapatinib and trastuzumab, combined with different paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy regimens, have shown high pathological complete response (pCR) rates, but at the cost of important toxicity. We hypothesised that this toxicity might be due to a specific interaction between paclitaxel and lapatinib. This trial assesses the toxicity and activity of the combination of docetaxel with lapatinib and trastuzumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIA to IIIC HER2-positive breast cancer received six cycles of chemotherapy (three cycles of docetaxel followed by three cycles of fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide). They were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to receive during the first three cycles either lapatinib (1000 mg orally daily), trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly), or trastuzumab + lapatinib at the same dose. The primary end point was pCR rate defined as ypT0/is. Secondary end points included safety and toxicity. pCR rate defined as ypT0/is ypN0 was assessed as an exploratory analysis. In June 2012, arm A was closed for futility based on the results from other studies. RESULTS: From October 2010 to January 2013, 128 patients were included in 14 centres. The percentage of the 122 assessable patients with pCR in the breast, and pCR in the breast and nodes, was numerically highest in the lapatinib + trastuzumab group (60% and 56%, respectively), intermediate in the trastuzumab group (52% and 52%), and lowest in the lapatinib group (46% and 36%). Frequency (%) of the most common grade 3-4 toxicities in the lapatinib /trastuzumab/lapatinib + trastuzumab arms were: febrile neutropenia 23/15/10, diarrhoea 9/2/18, infection (other) 9/4/8, and hepatic toxicity 0/2/8. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a numerically modest pCR rate increase with double anti-HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy, but suggests that the use of docetaxel rather than paclitaxel may not reduce toxicity.

        "abstract": "Carriers of germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene have a significant increased lifetime risk for being diagnosed with breast cancer. The incomplete penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that environmental and/or genetic factors modify the risk and incidence among mutation carriers. Nutrition and particular micronutrients play a central role in modifying the phenotypic expression of a given genotype by regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. The active form of vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, is a potent inhibitor of breast cancer growth. Here we report that two non-calcemic analogues of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, seocalcitol (EB1089) and QW-1624F2-2, collaborate with BRCA1 in mediating growth inhibition of breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem-like cells. EB1089 induces a G1/S phase growth arrest that coincides with induction of p21waf1 expression only in BRCA1-expressing cells. A complete knockdown of BRCA1 or p21waf1 renders the cells unresponsive to EB1089. Furthermore, we show that in the presence of ligand, BRCA1 associates with vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the complex co-occupies vitamin D responsive elements (VDRE) at the CDKN1A (p21waf1) promoter and enhances acetylation of histone H3 and H4 at these sites. Thus, BRCA1 expression is critical for mediating the biological impact of vitamin D3 in breast tumor cells.",

Mothers filled out the Child Feeding Questionnaire and the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire when children were four years old. Linear regression analyses were performed, adjusting for potential confounders. Of all mothers, 8.6% had a history of an eating disorder (2.5% anorexia nervosa (AN); 3.9% bulimia nervosa (BN); 2.2% both AN and BN). Compared to mothers without a history of eating disorders, mothers with a history of eating disorders, in particular AN, used less pressuring feeding strategies (standardized B = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.49, -0.11). Children of mothers with a history of AN had relatively high levels of emotional overeating (standardized B = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.39). Maternal history of BN was not related to mothers' feeding practices or children's emotional eating. Overall, the levels of emotional overeating among children of mothers with a history of eating disorders are noteworthy, particularly considering the young age (4 years) of participating children. This finding may reflect an effect of maternal eating disorders on the development of disordered eating patterns, but could also be subject to mothers' perception.",

DESIGN: Prospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Among 501 women recruited upon discontinuing contraception for the purpose of becoming pregnant, 258 (51%) became pregnant and were eligible for the study, of which 28 (11%) reported having physician-diagnosed GDM during follow-up. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of GDM associated with each standard deviation (SD) increment of preconception serum PFOA concentration (ng/mL, log-transformed) and six other PFCs were estimated with the use of logistic regression after adjusting for age, prepregnancy body mass index, smoking, and parity conditional on gravidity. RESULT(S): Preconception geometric mean (95% CI) PFOA concentrations (in ng/mL) were higher for women with than without GDM (3.94 [3.15-4.93] vs. 3.07 [2.83-3.12], respectively). Each SD increment in PFOA was associated with a 1.87-fold increased GDM risk (adjusted OR 1.86 [95% CI 1.14-3.02]). A slightly increased risk associated with each SD increment for the six other PFCs was observed as well (all ORs >1.0, range 1.06-1.27), although the associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggested that higher environmentally relevant concentrations of PFOA were significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. If corroborated, these findings may be suggestive of a possible environmental etiology for GDM.",

This article summarizes its history, examining the development of its key principles and the technical advancements. METHODS: Literature was thoroughly searched, and few senior surgeons were interviewed in order to identify the significant steps in the evolution of rotator cuff surgery. RESULTS: A wide variety of surgical options is available to reduce pain and restore function after rotator cuff tears. Rotator cuff repair surgical techniques evolved from open to arthroscopic and are still in development, with new fixation techniques and biological solutions to enhance tendon healing being proposed, tested in laboratory and in clinical trials. Although good or excellent results are often obtained, there is little evidence that the results of rotator cuff repair are improving with the decades. An overall high re-tear rate remains, but patients with failed rotator cuff repairs can experience outcomes comparable with those after successful repairs. CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff repair techniques evolve at a fast pace, with new solutions often being used without solid clinical evidence of superiority. It is necessary to conduct high-level clinical studies, in which data relating to anatomical integrity, patient self-assessed comfort and function, together with precise description of patient's condition and surgical technique, are collected.

SETTING: From 2010 to 2012, the entire target female population (aged 25-64) was invited to the first HPV screening round in an area where Pap test screening had been active since 2002. METHODS: For HPV-negative women, the interval was three years. For HPV-positive women, a cytological smear was stained and interpreted. Positive cytologies were referred to colposcopy; negatives were referred to repeat HPV after one year. If HPV was persistently positive, women were referred to colposcopy; if negative, to normal screening. RESULTS: In 2010-12 18728 women were screened, slightly higher participation than with Pap test (18233 64.7%); 1633 were HPV-positive (8.7%); 843 were positive at cytology triage (referral rate at baseline 4.5%). Of those referred at the one year HPV test, 84% complied (660/780); 356 were persistently positive (1.9%). The total referral rate was 6.4% compared with 3.7% for the Pap test. The detection rate was 9.2/1000 compared with 5.0% for the Pap test. The HPV positivity rate during the second round in women previously negative was 3.9% and the detection rate in HPV-positive cytology-positive women was 0.8/1000. CONCLUSIONS: HPV-based screening increases colposcopies at the first round, but also strongly increases the detection rate. At the second round, HPV prevalence was much lower and the detection rate also fell, corroborating the need for longer screening intervals in HPV-negative women.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are attributed to the systems biological role of a regulatory mechanism of the expression of protein coding genes. Research has identified miRNAs dysregulations in several but distinct pathophysiological processes, which hints at distinct systems-biology functions of miRNAs. The present analysis approached the role of miRNAs from a genomics perspective and assessed the biological roles of 2954 genes and 788 human miRNAs, which can be considered to interact, based on empirical evidence and computational predictions of miRNA versus gene interactions. RESULTS: From a genomics perspective, the biological processes in which the genes that are influenced by miRNAs are involved comprise of six major topics comprising biological regulation, cellular metabolism, information processing, development, gene expression and tissue homeostasis. The usage of this knowledge as a guidance for further research is sketched for two genetically defined functional areas: cell death and gene expression. Results suggest that the latter points to a fundamental role of miRNAs consisting of hyper-regulation of gene expression, i.e., the control of the expression of such genes which control specifically the expression of genes. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory research identified contributions of miRNA regulation to several distinct biological processes. The present analysis transferred this knowledge to a systems-biology level. A comprehensible and precise description of the biological processes in which the genes that are influenced by miRNAs are notably involved could be made. This knowledge can be employed to guide future research concerning the biological role of miRNA (dys-) regulations. The analysis also suggests that miRNAs especially control the expression of genes that control the expression of genes.",

With SPS, there are technical skills required that are not routine to standard laparoscopy. We explored the feasibility of micro-laparoscopic colectomy (MLC) using 3 mm instruments in patients eligible for standard laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: We performed an IRB approved retrospective review of all segmental colectomy performed by a single surgeon in selected patients using a micro-laparoscopic technique. We utilized two 3-mm trocars and one 12-mm Hasson umbilical incision, which was later widen for specimen extraction. RESULTS: Eighty patients underwent MLC: Twenty-six for diverticulitis, 26 for cancer, 22 for polyps, 3 for Crohn's disease, and 3 for volvulus. Eight patients were converted into either laparotomy or hand port (10 %) and three patients required the addition of one 5-mm trocar. Mean final extraction incision length was 3.9 cm. In cancer patients, the average lymph node harvest was 26 (range 13-70). The 30-day mortality was zero and the anastomotic leak rate was 1.3 %. CONCLUSIONS: MLC is safe and feasible when performing colon resections for benign and oncologic pathology. Extraction incision length is small and offers similar cosmesis to SPS without the steep learning curve needed to learn this technique.",

It was hypothesized that their applications in lipophilic food systems can be further enhanced by esterification of flavonoids with fatty acids. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Q3G) was esterified individually with six selected long chain fatty acids: stearic acid (STA), oleic acid (OLA), linoleic acid (LNA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and decosahexaenoic acid (DHA), using Candida antarctica B lipase as the biocatalyst. The antioxidant activity of esterified flavonoids was evaluated using lipid oxidation model systems of poly-unsaturated fatty acids-rich fish oil and human low density lipoprotein (LDL), in vitro. In the oil-in-water emulsion, Q3G esters exhibited 50% to 100% inhibition in primary oxidation and 30% to 75% inhibition in secondary oxidation. In bulk oil, Q3G esters did not provide considerable protection from lipid oxidation; however, Q3G demonstrated more than 50% inhibition in primary oxidation. EPA, DHA and ALA esters of Q3G showed significantly higher inhibition in Cu2+- and peroxyl radical-induced LDL oxidation in comparison to Q3G.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis is associated with high rates of rheumatic heart disease in developing countries. We sought to identify guidelines for empiric treatment of pharyngitis in low-resource settings. To inform the design of GAS vaccines, we determined the emm types associated with pharyngitis among African schoolchildren. METHODS: Surveillance for pharyngitis was conducted among children 5-16 years of age attending schools in Bamako, Mali. Students were encouraged to visit a study clinician when they had a sore throat. Enrollees underwent evaluation and throat swab for isolation of GAS. Strains were emm typed by standard methods. RESULTS: GAS was isolated from 449 (25.5%) of the 1,759 sore throat episodes. Painful cervical adenopathy was identified in 403 children (89.8%) with GAS infection and was absent in 369 uninfected children (28.2%). Emm type was determined in 396 (88.2%) of the 449 culture-positive children; 70 types were represented and 14 types accounted for 49% of isolates. Based on the proportion of the 449 isolates bearing emm types included in the 30-valent vaccine (31.0%) plus nonvaccine types previously shown to react to vaccine-induced bactericidal antibodies (44.1%), the vaccine could protect against almost 75% of GAS infections among Bamako schoolchildren. CONCLUSIONS: Two promising strategies could reduce rheumatic heart disease in low-resource settings. Administering antibiotics to children with sore throat and tender cervical adenopathy could treat most GAS-positive children while reducing use of unnecessary antibiotics for uninfected children. Broad coverage against M types associated with pharyngitis in Bamako schoolchildren might be achieved with the 30-valent GAS vaccine under development.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2013 for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). Thus far, a number of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of vortioxetine have been conducted in patients with MDD. We performed a meta-analysis to increase the statistical power of these studies and enhance our current understanding of the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD. METHODS: We performed an extensive search of databases and the clinical trial registry. The mean change in total scores on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from the baseline were the primary outcome measures. The secondary efficacy measures were the response and remission rates, as defined by a 50% or greater reduction in HAM-D/MADRS total scores and as a score of 10 or less in the MADRS and 7 or less in the HAM-D total scores at the end of treatment. RESULTS: We included 7 published and 5 unpublished short-term (6-12 wk) RCTs in our meta-analysis. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than placebo, with an effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD]) of -0.217 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.313 to -0.122) and with odds ratios (ORs) for response and remission of 1.652 (95% CI 1.321 to 2.067) and 1.399 (95% CI 1.104 to 1.773), respectively. Those treated with vortioxetine did not differ significantly from those treated with selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors/agomelatine with regard to the SMD of the primary outcome measure (0.081, -0.062 to 0.223) or for response (OR 0.815, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.135) and remission (OR 0.843, 95% CI 0.575 to 1.238) rates. Discontinuation owing to lack of efficacy (OR 0.541, 95% CI 0.308 to 0.950) was significantly less common among those treated with vortioxetine than among those who received placebo, whereas discontinuation owing to adverse events (AEs; OR 1.530, 95% CI 1.144 to 2.047) was significantly more common among those treated with vortioxetine than among those receiving placebo. There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates between vortioxetine and comparators owing to inefficacy (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.650), whereas discontinuation owing to AEs was significantly less common in the vortioxetine than in the comparator group (OR 0.728, 95% CI 0.554 to 0.957). LIMITATIONS: Studies examining the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD are limited. CONCLUSION: Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a limited number of heterogeneous RCTs.",

The elongated nanotube assembly was further explored as a template for biomineralization of silver ions to silver nanowires. A comparative study using an analogous alpha-peptide helix reveals the importance of the spatial arrangement of aromatic side chains along the helical cylinder in a 12-helix.

It is through this lens that two examples are described in which innovative approaches have been used to dissect the complexities of stroke pathophysiology. The first example focuses on one of the most fundamental genetic factors relevant to the brain and ischemic injury: biological sex. Much might be gained by understanding the details of sex-specific pathobiology, if the field is to develop therapies that work well in patients of both sexes. The second example surrounds brain-spleen cell cycling after stroke which is fundamental to our evolving understanding that stroke is a systemic disease, rather than solely a lesion of the brain. While much work remains, it is now apparent that brain-spleen cell cycling is temporally specific, varies in intensity, and involves cell players that are of much wider lineages than originally believed. In the future, it is likely that innovation will need to turn to \"big data\", particularly if our field is to tackle the daunting questions that most greatly matter to unraveling brain injury. The huge availability and growth rate of biomedical data, handled in a shared but coherent environment, offers an opportunity to further vitalize stroke research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is common and associated with poor outcome in hemodialysis patients. In hemodialysis patients, geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) have been shown as the nutritional and inflammatory markers, respectively. The present study aimed to assess the predictive ability of GNRI and DcR3 for PEW status and long-term outcomes in chronic hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 318 hemodialysis patients was conducted with a median follow-up of 54 months. Malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS) was used as the reference standard for the presence of PEW. Endpoints were cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Baseline GNRI had a strong negative correlation with DcR3 and MIS score. For patients with age < or >/=60, high DcR3 and low GNRI were independent predictors for the presence of PEW at baseline. At the end of the study, 81 patients died (27 cardiovascular deaths). The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of low GNRI and high DcR3 were 1.93 (1.1-4.8) and 2.53 (1.2-5.5) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.85 (1.1-3.2) and 2.37 (1.5-3.7) for all-cause mortality, respectively. While integrated into a model of conventional risk factors, GNRI together with DcR3 further significantly improved the predictability for overall mortality (c statistic, 0.823). CONCLUSIONS: Low GNRI and high DcR3 were the alternatives for identifying hemodialysis patients at risk of PEW and overall mortality. Further studies are needed to verify whether timely recognition of hemodialysis patients with a high malnutrition-inflammation risk could reduce their mortality by appropriate interventional strategies.",

The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is often used as a measure of agreement when the rating is a continuous variable. We present an approach for calculating the sample size required for testing the equality of two CCCs, H0: CCC1 = CCC2 vs. HA: CCC1  not equal CCC2, where two assessment methods are used on the same sample, with two raters resulting in correlated CCC estimates. Our approach is to simulate one large \"exemplary\" dataset based on the specification of the joint distribution of the pairwise ratings for the two methods. We then create two new random variables from the simulated data that have the same variance-covariance matrix as the two dependent CCC estimates using the Taylor series linearization method. The method requires minimal computing time and can be easily extended to comparing more than two CCCs, or Kappa statistics.",

Narrative scripts were written based on the original research interviews, with care taken to reflect the key themes from the research. We explore the way in which the qualitative findings bring to life patient and partner experiences and what it means for nurses, midwives and doctors to be prepared to care for couples affected by HIV.

Similar levels of psychotropic-medication use were found among individuals in long unions that continued throughout the follow-up and were non-marital, marital, or changed from non-marital to marital. Among men and women who separated from longer cohabiting unions of more than five years, however, an increase in medication prevalence was observed immediately before separation, followed by a similar decline after separation. At the time of separation the level of medication use was 9.9 per cent (95% CI = 8.7 - 11.3) among men and 15.7 per cent (95% CI = 14.2 - 17.4) among women compared to 4.3 per cent (95% CI = 3.7 - 5.0) and 8.0 per cent (95% CI = 7.2 - 9.0), respectively, among those who cohabited continuously. No changes in medication use were observed before or after separation among those leaving shorter cohabiting unions of less than five years. Among those marrying following shorter cohabiting unions a positive effect of approaching marriage was observed only among women. Compared to continuous cohabiters, the level of medication use was higher among men and women separating from both short-term and long-term cohabiting unions five years before separation. This selective effect suggests that cohabiters with mental-health problems might benefit from relationship counselling. In a long-term stable union it seems to matter little for mental health whether the union is marital or non-marital, the break-up of a long-term non-marital union being strongly associated with adverse mental-health effects.",

The objective of this study is to show that although endoscopic treatment is the standard palliation, surgical laparoscopic treatment is both feasible and effective for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative resectability was evaluated by dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans. Endoscopic palliation was the first choice for patients with metastatic disease and for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with bad performance status. Laparoscopic surgical palliation was indicated for patients with jaundice and locally advanced pancreatic cancer (elective palliation) and for patients with jaundice with metastatic disease and failure in the endoscopic/percutaneous treatment (necessary palliation). Elective palliation consisted of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy and necessary palliation consisted of laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy alone. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients received laparoscopic surgical palliation. Morbidity rate was 33.3% and mortality was 2.08%. There was no need for late surgeries in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: Surgical laparoscopic palliation is a feasible treatment option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Even though metallic stents are still the best palliation method for patients with systemic disease, if stents fail, the laparoscopic approach is a viable treatment.",

At crystallite sizes of  approximately 75 and  approximately 135 nm the dominant feature is softening of the shear modulus as the charge order transition point, Tco ( approximately 225 K), is approached from above and below, matching the form of softening seen previously in samples with 'bulk' properties. This is consistent with a bilinear dominant strain/order parameter coupling, which occurs between the tetragonal shear strain and the Jahn-Teller (Gamma3(+)) order parameter. At crystallite sizes of  approximately 34 and  approximately 42 nm the charge ordered phase is suppressed but there is still softening of the shear modulus, with a minimum near Tco. This indicates that some degree of pseudoproper ferroelastic behaviour is retained. The primary cause of the suppresion of the charge ordered structure in nanocrystalline samples is therefore considered to be due to suppression of macroscopic strain, even though MnO6 octahedra must develop some Jahn-Teller distortions on a local length scale. This mechanism for stabilizing ferromagnetism differs from imposition of either an external magnetic field or a homogeneous external strain field (from a substrate), and is likely to lead both to local strain heterogeneity within the nanocrystallites and to different tilting of octahedra within the orthorhombic structure. An additional first order transition occurs near 40 K in all samples and appears to involve some very small strain contrast between two ferromagnetic structures.",

Participants were less likely to ascribe knowledge for beliefs based on probabilistic evidence than for beliefs based on perceptual evidence (Experiments 1 and 2A) or testimony providing causal information (Experiment 2B). Denial of knowledge for beliefs based on probabilistic evidence did not arise because participants viewed such beliefs as unjustified, nor because such beliefs leave open the possibility of error. These findings rule out traditional philosophical accounts for why probabilistic evidence does not produce knowledge. The experiments instead suggest that people deny knowledge because they distrust drawing conclusions about an individual based on reasoning about the population to which it belongs, a tendency previously identified by \"judgment and decision making\" researchers. Consistent with this, participants were more willing to ascribe knowledge for beliefs based on probabilistic evidence that is specific to a particular case (Experiments 3A and 3B).",

A parallel multiple mediator model was used to test the hypothesis that trauma symptoms would mediate the relationship between both types of maltreatment and dating violence, marijuana, and alcohol use outcomes. Although both types of maltreatment were not directly associated with dating violence and substance use outcomes, the indirect effects of anxiety, anger, and dissociation on the relationship between maltreatment and substance use/dating violence were significant. Direct effects of both types of maltreatment on past year use of dating violence + alcohol use and dating violence + marijuana use were not significant, but results demonstrated a significant indirect effect for anger on the relationship between exposure to IPV and past year dating violence + marijuana use. No other indirect effects were significant.

Accessory tragus is commonly a limited deformity; however, it can be a sign of associated congenital syndromes. It has been shown to be associated with Goldenhar syndrome, Townes-Brocks syndrome, Treacher-Collins syndrome, VACTERL syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhron syndrome.

METHODS: Forty white rabbits were randomized to receive four-times daily instillation of either 0.0015% tafluprost (TF) preserved with 0.001% BAK (TF-BAK); 0.004% travoprost (TR) with 0.015% BAK (TR-BAK) or 0.001% PQ (TR-PQ); or preservative-free artificial tears in one eye for a 4-week period. Tear samples collected from the 40 rabbits were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to identify the presence of inflammatory cytokines: interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 on day 14. Subsequently, harvested cornea and bulbar conjunctiva were evaluated using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: IL-6 was significantly increased in TF-BAK and TR-BAK groups compared to controls and TR-PQ group (p = 0.005); however, IL-1beta level was not significantly different among four groups (p = 0.360). Rabbits treated with TR-BAK showed decreased goblet cell density of bulbar conjunctiva and increased pyknotic change and vacuolization of corneal epithelial cells on light microscopy; similar change occurred but was less severe in TF-BAK group. The TR-PQ group showed similar results as the controls. The destruction of the microvillar architecture of bulbar conjunctiva and cornea was most prominent in the TR-BAK group. CONCLUSIONS: Preservatives included in the anti-glaucoma eye-drops showed different ocular surface changes according to the concentration and type in the rabbits. Prostaglandin analogues preserved with higher level of BAK may cause more harmful effects on the ocular surface than PQ-preserved medications.",

The incidence of individual diseases is not determined, yet the variety of genetic diseases reported is tremendous, most of which follow autosomal recessive inheritance reflecting the social norms in the population, including high rates of consanguinity, which favor the increase in incidence of these diseases. Genetic services including all activities for the diagnosis, care, and prevention of genetic diseases at community level are extremely inadequate. Services are limited to some clinical and laboratory diagnostic services with no genetic counseling. These services are localized within the capital thus preventing their accessibility to high-risk communities. Screening programs, which are at the core of public health prevention services, are minimal and not nationally mandated. The absence of adequate genetic services is attributed to many factors undermining the importance of genetic diseases and their burden on society, the most important of which is genetic illiteracy at all levels of the population, including high-risk families, the general public, and most importantly health care providers and public health officials. Thus, a country like Lebanon, where genetic diseases are expected to be highly prevalent, is in utmost need for community genetics services. Strategies need to be developed to familiarize public health officials and medical professionals with medical genetics leading to a public health infrastructure that delivers community genetics services for the prevention and care of genetic disorders at community level.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unobserved, or \"home\" buprenorphine induction is common in some clinical practices. Patients take the initial and subsequent doses of buprenorphine after, rather than during, an office visit. This review summarizes the literature on the feasibility and acceptability, safety, effectiveness, and prevalence of unobserved induction. METHODS: We searched the English language literature for studies describing unobserved buprenorphine induction and associated outcomes. Clinical studies were assessed by strength of design, bias, and internal and external validity. Surveys of provider practices and unobserved induction adoption were reviewed for prevalence data and key findings. We also examined previous review papers and international buprenorphine treatment guidelines. RESULTS: N = 10 clinical studies describing unobserved induction were identified: 1 randomized controlled trial, 3 prospective cohort studies, and 6 retrospective cohort studies. The evidence supports the feasibility of unobserved induction, particularly in office-based primary care practices. Evidence is weak to moderate in support of no differences in adverse event rates between unobserved and observed inductions. There is insufficient or weak evidence in terms of any or no differences in overall effectiveness (treatment retention, medication adherence, illicit opioid abstinence, other drug use). N = 9 provider surveys assessed unobserved induction: observed induction logistics are seen as barriers to buprenorphine prescribing; unobserved induction appears widespread in specific locations. International guidelines reviewed emphasize clinician or pharmacist observed induction (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia); only one (Denmark) explicitly endorses unobserved induction. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence supporting unobserved induction as more, less, or as effective as observed induction. However, the predominantly observational and naturalistic studies of unobserved induction reviewed, all of which have significant sources of bias and limited external validity, document feasibility and low rates of adverse events. Unobserved induction seems to be widely adopted in US and French regional provider surveys. Prescribers, policy makers, and patients should balance the benefits of observed induction such as maximum clinical supervision with the ease-of-use and comparable safety profile of unobserved induction.",

The aim of this study was to assess the role of PR status as a prognostic factor in addition to other well-established prognostic factors. Data from five independent German breast cancer centers were pooled. A total of 7,965 breast cancer patients were included for whom information about their PR status was known, as well as other patient and tumor characteristics commonly used as prognostic factors. Cox proportional hazards models were built to compare the predictive value of PR status in addition to age at diagnosis, tumor size, nodal status, grading, and estrogen receptor (ER) status. PR status significantly increased the accuracy of prognostic predictions with regard to overall survival, distant disease-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival. There were differences with regard to its prognostic value relative to subgroups such as nodal status, ER status, and grading. The prognostic value of PR status was greatest in patients with a positive nodal status, negative ER status, and low grading. The PR-status adds prognostic value in addition to ER status and should not be omitted from clinical routine testing. The significantly greater prognostic value in node-positive and high-grade tumors suggests a greater role in the progression of advanced and aggressive tumors.",

MATERIAL/METHODS: Between December 2012 and May 2013, 44 consecutive patients with multiple sclerosis and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent the B-mode, color Doppler, and duplex Doppler evaluations of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and vertebral vein. The following four parameters were investigated: IJV stenosis, reversal of postural control of the cerebral venous outflow pathways, absence of detectable blood flow in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins, and reflux in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins in the sitting or supine position. RESULTS: In the study group, IJV stenosis, postural control reversal of the cerebral venous outflow pathways, and absence of flow in the IJVs and/or vertebral veins were found in 3 (6.8%), 2 (4.5%), and 3 (6.8%) patients, respectively. In the control group, IJV stenosis (P=0.12), postural control reversal of the cerebral venous outflow pathways (P=0.50), and absence of flow (P=0.12) were not detected. Abnormal reflux was found neither in multiple sclerosis patients nor in healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in the cerebral venous drainage through the IJV or vertebral vein was found between patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy subjects within any of the investigated ultrasonographic parameters.",

        "abstract": "Children with rolandic epilepsy (RE) are often associated with cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Findings from neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies in RE have now demonstrated dysfunction not only in rolandic focus, but also in distant neuronal circuits. Little is known, however, about whether there is distributed abnormal spontaneous brain activity in RE. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), the present study aimed to determine whether children with RE show abnormal local synchronization during resting state and, if so, whether these changes could be associated with the behavioral/clinical characteristics of RE. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) in children with RE (n = 30) and healthy children (n = 20) was computed on resting-state functional MRI data. In comparison with healthy children, children with RE showed increased ReHo in the central, premotor, and prefrontal regions, while they showed decreased ReHo in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole. In addition, the ReHo value in the left orbitofrontal cortex negatively was corrected with performance intelligence quotient in the children with RE. The aberrant local synchronization, not strictly related to primary site of the typical rolandic focus, indicates the neuropathophysiological mechanism of RE. The study findings may shed new light on the understanding of neural correlation of neuropsychological deficiencies in the children with RE.",

After the aging procedures, the monoclinic phase percentages were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and topographic surface analysis was performed by 3D profilometry. The specimens were then subjected to biaxial flexure testing (1mm/min, load 100kgf, in water). The biaxial flexural strength data (MPa) were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (alpha=0.05). The data for monoclinic phase percentage and profilometry (Ra) were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests. RESULTS: ANOVA revealed that flexural strength was affected by the aging procedures (p=0.002). The M (781.6MPa) and TM (771.3MPa) groups presented lower values of flexural strength than did C (955MPa), AUT (955.8MPa), T (960.8MPa) and STO (910.4MPa). The monoclinic phase percentage was significantly higher only for STO (12.22%) and AUT (29.97%) when compared with that of the control group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.004). In addition, the surface roughnesses were similar among the groups (p=0.165). SIGNIFICANCE: Water storage for 400 days and autoclave aging procedures induced higher phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic; however, they did not affect the flexural strength of Y-TZP ceramic, which decreased only after mechanical and thermomechanical cycling.",

METHODS: A total of 135 Mongolian gerbils were randomly divided into two groups: an H. pylori infection group and a control group. Both groups were fed the same diet and the same amount of food. Each group was then divided into three subgroups, which were sacrificed at 6, 12, or 18 mo for analysis. At each time point, arterial blood was collected from the abdominal aorta and a complete blood cell count was analyzed in the clinical laboratory in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in platelet counts (938.00 +/- 270.27/L vs 962.95 +/- 162.56 x 10(9)/L), red blood cell counts (8.11 +/- 1.25/L vs 8.44 +/- 1.48 x 10(12)/L), or hemoglobin levels (136.9 +/- 8.76 g/L vs 123.21 +/- 18.42 g/L) between the control and the H. pylori groups, respectively, at 18 mo. With the exception of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), all other indicators, including white blood cell counts, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte count percentage, showed no significant differences between the control and H. pylori infection groups at each time point. The MCV in the H. pylori infection group (52.32 f/L +/- 2.86 f/L) was significantly lower than the control group (55.63 +/- 1.89 f/L) at 18 mo (P = 0.005), though no significant differences were observed at 6 (54.40 +/- 2.44 f/L vs 53.30 +/- 1.86 f/L) or 12 mo (53.73 +/- 2.31 f/L vs 54.80 +/- 3.34 f/L). CONCLUSION: A single H. pylori infection is insufficient to cause onset of ITP or IDA and other factors may be required for disease onset.",

IGF-1 levels were found increased in the blood and decreased in the cerebrospinal fluid of ASD children. Accordingly, IGF-1 treatment can rescue behavioral deficits in mouse models of ASD, and IGF-1 trials have been proposed for ASD children. IGF-1 is mainly synthesized in the liver, and its synthesis is dependent on growth hormone (GH) produced in the pituitary gland. GH also modulates cognitive functions, and altered levels of GH have been detected in ASD patients. Here, we analyzed the expression of GH, IGF-1, their receptors, and regulatory hormones in the neuroendocrine system of adult male mice lacking the homeobox transcription factor Engrailed-2 (En2 (-/-) mice). En2 (-/-) mice display ASD-like behaviors (social interactions, defective spatial learning, increased seizure susceptibility) accompanied by relevant neuropathological changes (loss of cerebellar and forebrain inhibitory neurons). Recent studies showed that En2 modulates IGF-1 activity during postnatal cerebellar development. We found that GH mRNA expression was markedly deregulated throughout the neuroendocrine axis in En2 (-/-) mice, as compared to wild-type controls. In mutant mice, GH mRNA levels were significantly increased in the pituitary gland, blood, and liver, whereas decreased levels were detected in the hippocampus. These changes were paralleled by decreased levels of GH protein in the hippocampus but not other tissues of En2 (-/-) mice. IGF-1 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the liver and down-regulated in the En2 (-/-) hippocampus, but no differences were detected in the levels of IGF-1 protein between the two genotypes. Our data strengthen the notion that altered GH levels in the hippocampus may be involved in learning disabilities associated to ASD.",

Plantar pressure distributions during gait are regularly assessed in this patient group; however, the association between frequently reported magnitude-based pressure variables and clinical outcomes has not been clearly established. Recently, a novel approach to the analysis of plantar pressure distributions throughout stance phase, the dynamic plantar loading index, has been proposed. This study aimed to assess the utility of this index for measuring foot function in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Barefoot plantar pressures during gait were measured in 63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 51 matched controls. Additionally, 15 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis had in-shoe plantar pressures measured whilst walking in standardized footwear for two conditions: shoes-only; and shoes with prescribed custom foot orthoses. The dynamic plantar loading index was determined for all participants and conditions. Patient and control groups were compared for significant differences as were the shod and orthosis conditions. FINDINGS: The patient group was found to have a mean index of 0.19, significantly lower than the control group's index of 0.32 (p>0.001, 95% CI [0.054, 0.197]). No significant differences were found between the shoe-only and shoe plus orthosis conditions. The loading index was found to correlate with clinical measures of structural deformity. INTERPRETATION: The dynamic plantar loading index may be a useful tool for researchers and clinicians looking to objectively assess dynamic foot function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, it may be unresponsive to changes caused by orthotic interventions in this patient group.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to investigate the efficacy of using multi-resolution nonuniform dose voxel geometry in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. An in-house MC code based on the dose planning method MC code was developed in C++ to accommodate the nonuniform dose voxel geometry package since general purpose MC codes use their own coupled geometry packages. We devised the package in a manner that the entire calculation volume was first divided into a coarse mesh and then the coarse mesh was subdivided into nonuniform voxels with variable voxel sizes based on density difference. We name this approach as multi-resolution subdivision (MRS). It generates larger voxels in small density gradient regions and smaller voxels in large density gradient regions. To take into account the large dose gradients due to the beam penumbra, the nonuniform voxels can be further split using ray tracing starting from the beam edges. The accuracy of the implementation of the algorithm was verified by comparing with the data published by Rogers and Mohan. The discrepancy was found to be 1% to 2%, with a maximum of 3% at the interfaces. Two clinical cases were used to investigate the efficacy of nonuniform voxel geometry in the MC code. Applying our MRS approach, we started with the initial voxel size of 5 x 5 x 3 mm(3), which was further divided into smaller voxels. The smallest voxel size was 1.25 x 1.25 x 3 mm(3). We found that the simulation time per history for the nonuniform voxels is about 30% to 40% faster than the uniform fine voxels (1.25 x 1.25 x 3 mm(3)) while maintaining similar accuracy.",

As in traditional analytical and statistical approaches, this new algorithm, called TRIFORCE, reports both component areas and derivatives as a function of the atomic coordinates and radii. Unique to TRIFORCE are the rapid and scalable approaches for the determination of sphere intersection points and numerical estimation of the surface areas, derivatives, and other properties that can be associated with the surface area facets. The algorithm performs a special tessellation and semianalytical integration that uses a precomputed look-up table. This provides a simple way to balance numerical accuracy and memory usage. TRIFORCE calculates derivatives in the same manner, enabling application in force-dependent activities such as molecular geometry minimization. TRIFORCE is available free of charge for academic purposes as both a C++ library, which can be directly interfaced to existing molecular simulation packages, and a web-accessible application.",

However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 replication and pathogenesis are not well understood. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-27a was significantly decreased in EV71-infected cells. Interestingly, the over-expression of miR-27a could inhibit EV71 replication, as measured by virus titration, qPCR, and Western blotting. We identified EGFR mRNA is a bona fide target of miR-27a by computational analysis and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, miR-27a could decrease EGFR expression, as measured by qPCR and Western blotting. Moreover, the inhibition of EGFR expression by miR-27a decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, which facilitate EV71 replication. These results suggest that miR-27a may have antiviral activity against EV71 by inhibiting EGFR.",

In 2010, the main phytophagous stink bugs caught in a grid sampling plan across two fields were the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), the rice stink bug, Oebalus pugnax (F.), the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and the red shouldered stink bug, Thyanta custator (F.), for both adults and nymphs. In 2011, the main phytophagous stink bugs were E. servus, O. pugnax, N. viridula, and T. custator across two fields. Adult stink bug counts adjacent to fallow fields were 2.1-fold greater for all species combined compared with counts adjacent to woods. Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) indicated significant aggregation for 35% of analyses for adults and nymph stink bugs at each sampling date. As a measure of spatial and temporal stability, positive SADIE association indices among sampling dates recorded 11, 36, 43, and 16% of analyses for adult E. servus and 7, 50, 50, and 14% for adult O. pugnax in fields A, B, C, and D, respectively. Adult and nymph stink bugs were spatially associated within wheat fields based on SADIE association indices. Seasonal counts of stink bugs were spatially associated with spike counts at least once for each species across the four fields. Future work may investigate practices to reduce stink bug buildup on wheat in the spring and movement to susceptible crops such as corn, Zea mays L."

The model of pregnant rats with intrauterine hyperglycemia was established by intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). Rats with established GDM were randomly grouped, and the pregnant rats in the experimental group were subsequently injected with recombinant sRAGE protein (5 mg/kg, in 0.2 mL PBS) at tail vein every 24 h, while the rats in control group were injected with the same dosage of albumin solution. Blood glucose, serum levels of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), and levels of RAGE protein in brain and heart tissues of pregnant rats were measured at 3, 13, and 19 days postconception. At 19 days fetuses were delivered by cesarean section, number of fetuses, their weight and placental weights were recorded, and fetal malformations and defects were analyzed visually and pathologically. The expression level of RAGE, NOX2, MCP-1, p65, VCAM-1, and VEGF mRNA in placenta was evaluated by real-time PCR. p65 protein localization was detected by immunohistochemistry in fetal brain and heart tissue sections. We analyzed the correlation between AGEs and RAGE level and the development of fetal rats, and the protective effect of blocking AGEs-RAGE pathway on the fetal development in the rat model of GDM was investigated. (1) The concentration of blood glucose and AGEs in serum of pregnant rats with GDM was significantly higher than in control group (p < 0.05), with strong correlation between blood glucose and levels of AGEs (r = 0.693, p < 0.05). (2) While both the number of fetuses and placental wet weight in pregnant rat model of GDM were similar to control group, pups from GDM group exhibited higher incidence of developmental abnormalities and higher average weight (p < 0.05). sRAGE treatment slightly but not significantly reduced the probability of the fetal developmental defects, as compared to GDM group. (3) p65, a part of the NF-kB heterodimeric complex, was localized to cell nuclei in the fetal tissues of pups delivered by GDM rats, while sRAGE treatment partially restored cytoplasmic localization of p65, similarly to control tissues. Increased incidence of fetal developmental defects observed in offsprings of pregnant rats with GDM had significant correlation with the level of AGEs in serum of pregnant rats and expression levels of RAGE protein in tissues. GDM resulted in upregulation of mRNA expression of several pro-inflammatory and ROS-inducing genes in placental tissues of pregnant rats. Elevated blood glucose, serum AGEs levels, and increased gene expression are attenuated by intravenous sRAGE treatment. sRAGE appears to reduce the activity of NF-kappaB in fetal tissues, thus potentially having a protective effect on fetal development.",

However, not every metal behaves in the same manner during film growth, and hence, it is crucial that the ability of various metals to produce crystalline MoS2 be thoroughly investigated. In this work, MoS2 was deposited on metal substrates, Al, Ag, Ni, and Cu, using a pulsed laser. Highly crystalline few-layer MoS2 was successfully grown on Ag, but is absent in Al, Ni, and Cu under specific growth conditions. This discrepancy was attributed to either excessively strong or insufficient adlayer-substrate interactions. In the case of Al, the effects of the strong interface interactions can be offset by increasing the amount of source atoms supplied, thereby producing semicrystalline few-layer MoS2. The results show that despite PLD being a physical vapor deposition technique, both physical and chemical processes play an important role in MoS2 growth on metal substrates.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Injection drug use has been the major cause of HIV/AIDS in China in the past two decades. We measured the prevalences of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence and their associated risk factors among current injection drug users (IDUs) in Ruili city, a border region connecting China with Myanmar that has been undergoing serious drug use and HIV spread problems. An estimate of the number of current IDUs is also presented. METHODS: In 2012, Chinese IDUs who had injected within the past six months and aged >/= 18 years were recruited using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) technique. Participants underwent interviews and serological testing for HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis. Logistic regression indentified factors associated with HIV and HCV infections. Multiplier method was used to obtain an estimate of the size of the current IDU population via combining available service data and findings from our survey. RESULTS: Among 370 IDUs recruited, the prevalence of HIV and HCV was 18.3% and 41.5%, respectively. 27.1% of participants had shared a needle/syringe in their lifetime. Consistent condom use rates were low among both regular (6.8%) and non-regular (30.4%) partners. Factors independently associated with being HIV positive included HCV infection, having a longer history of injection drug use and experience of needle/syringe sharing. Participants with HCV infection were more likely to be HIV positive, have injected more types of drugs, have shared other injection equipments and have unprotected sex with regular sex partners. The estimated number of current IDUs in Ruili city was 2,714 (95% CI: 1,617-5,846). CONCLUSIONS: IDUs may continue to be a critical subpopulation for transmission of HIV and other infections in this region because of the increasing population and persistent high risk of injection and sexual behaviours. Developing innovative strategies that can improve accessibility of current harm reduction services and incorporate more comprehensive contents is urgently needed.",

Results showed that the teratogenic index (LC50 /EC50 ) of UVI3003 was as high as 5.4. UVI3003 induced multiple malformations of embryos, including deformed fins, reduced brains, small jaws, bent tails and edema in hearts, the degree of which became more severe with increasing exposure concentration. Although no significant difference was observed in the hatching rates between the exposure group and control, the whole body length was significantly reduced by 6.5% and 8.9% when exposed to 200 and 300 microg l(-1) of UVI3003, respectively. The heart rate also significantly decreased by 8.8-50.2% during exposure. Further experiments revealed that the pharyngula stage was the most sensitive development phase in terms of embryo response to UVI3003. The results demonstrated severe teratogenicity of RXR antagonist in zebrafish embryos and provided important data for ecotoxicological evaluation of RXR antagonists.",

METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) in China. Data for mean systolic blood pressure, burden of deaths,Years of Life Lost(YLLs), Years Lived with Disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and relative risk were corrected for regression dilution bias to calculate the population impact fractions and estimate the attributable deaths and DALYs. RESULTS: Among all the deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and DALYs, 64.0% of them were caused by high blood pressure. In 2010, a total number of 2.043 million deaths were caused by high blood pressure, including 1.154 million males. 2.007 million deaths were due to cardiovascular diseases, 35 000 due to chronic kidney diseases. Deaths caused by high blood pressure accounted for 24.6% of all the deaths. In total, 37.94 million person-years DALYs were caused by high blood pressure, of which 23.33 million person-years were males and 14.61 million person-years were females. There were 2.365 million person-years of YLDs and 35.57 million person-years of YLLs, which both accounted for 12% of the total DALYs. CONCLUSION: Compared to the global results of GBD 160, on either deaths or DALYs, the proportion attributable to high blood pressure were quite high for a country like China. The health effects caused by high blood pressure seemed to be quite serious which called for attention.",

Caucasian students were more likely to report NSSI, particularly cutting behavior, self-injured with greater frequency and versatility, and reported greater increases in positively valenced, high arousal emotions following NSSI, compared to Asian students. Among Asian students, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, experiential avoidance, and anger suppression increased the likelihood of reporting a history of NSSI.

In recent years, more attention has been given to the use of complementary and alternative medicines, including osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), as possible effective interventions in increasing patients' health reported outcomes. With regard to OMT, very little research was focused on its effectiveness in enhancing health in the general population. OBJECTIVES: To explore the extent to which OMT is effective in improving quality of life in referring patients. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Private osteopathic clinical practices in Italy. INTERVENTIONS: 25 osteopaths from Central and Southern Italy participated in the study. Self-referred patients, with a diagnosed musculo-skeletal disorder and older than 18 years of age, who did not undergo any OMT session in the previous 12 months and/or contemporarily additional manual therapies were enrolled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changing from baseline SF36 general health sub-domain scores was used as the study primary outcomes. RESULTS: 1000 patients with primary diagnosis of musculo-skeletal disorder were initially enrolled. 988 patients completed the study. After 4 weeks, mean general health score was 14.7 points higher (95% CI 13.9-15.6; Cohen's d=0.84). Similarly, physical and mental component scores increased (11.5; 95% CI 10.8-12.1; d=0.87 and 9.6; 95% CI 8.6-10.5; d=0.61 respectively). No association between SF36 domains and socio-demographic exposures was found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Positive changes on various quality of life dimensions were reported by patients receiving osteopathic treatment. The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (identifier NCT01965678).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation (AE) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is usually followed by a spontaneous decline in HBV DNA levels. The subsequent treatment is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha2a (PEG-IFN-alpha2a) for such CHB patients. METHODS: A total of 74 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with a spontaneous HBV DNA decline (by >2 log10 IU*ml(-1), compared with baseline levels before antiviral treatment) after AE (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]: 10-30-fold the upper limit of normal [ULN], total bilirubin [TBIL]: 2-20 mg*dl(-1), prothrombin time activity >60%) were included. In total, 22 patients (group A) received PEG-IFN-alpha2a treatment (180 microg*kg(-1)*week(-1), when ALT was <10 ULN and TBIL<2 mg*dl(-1)) for 48 weeks, with 48 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. Twenty-one patients (group B) selected continual entecavir therapy. Thirty-one patients (group C, control group) received routine liver-protective drugs. RESULTS: At week 96, virological response rates were 90.5%, 100% and 48%, and ALT normalization rates were 81%, 95% and 40% for groups A, B and C, respectively. HBeAg seroconversion rates were 71.4%, 45% and 32% in groups A, B and C, respectively. A high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss rate was observed in PEG-IFN-alpha2a-treated patients, while no entecavir-treated patients achieved HBsAg loss. Group A patients suffered from typical PEG-IFN therapy-related adverse events. No severe adverse event was observed in any groups. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-IFN-alpha2a is effective and safe for treating CHB patients demonstrating a spontaneous decline in HBV DNA after AE, and yields an increased likelihood of HBsAg loss.",

        "abstract": "Playing a musical instrument is associated with numerous neural processes that continuously modify the human brain and may facilitate characteristic auditory skills. In a longitudinal study, we investigated the auditory and neural plasticity of musical learning in 111 young children (aged 7-9 y) as a function of the intensity of instrumental practice and musical aptitude. Because of the frequent co-occurrence of central auditory processing disorders and attentional deficits, we also tested 21 children with attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder [AD(H)D]. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography revealed enlarged Heschl's gyri and enhanced right-left hemispheric synchronization of the primary evoked response (P1) to harmonic complex sounds in children who spent more time practicing a musical instrument. The anatomical characteristics were positively correlated with frequency discrimination, reading, and spelling skills. Conversely, AD(H)D children showed reduced volumes of Heschl's gyri and enhanced volumes of the plana temporalia that were associated with a distinct bilateral P1 asynchrony. This may indicate a risk for central auditory processing disorders that are often associated with attentional and literacy problems. The longitudinal comparisons revealed a very high stability of auditory cortex morphology and gray matter volumes, suggesting that the combined anatomical and functional parameters are neural markers of musicality and attention deficits. Educational and clinical implications are considered.",

It also examined the strength of associations of the DEX-Self and the DEX-TH reports with the sub-tests of the BADS as well as two other real-life executive tasks, the Everyday Description Task and the Twenty Question Test. METHODS: This study compared 30 patients with anterior lesions (AL) to 22 patients with posterior lesions (PL). Twenty-nine healthy participants and their relatives were included as controls. RESULTS: Significant group differences were found only on the DEX-TH, but not on the DEX-Self, indicating poor insight in patients with AL. The DEX-TH were revealed accurate in detecting more severe dysexecutive symptoms in the AL group. Furthermore, only the DEX-TH reportings were significantly correlated with the above executive tests. Multiple regression analysis showed that the Modified Six Elements Test, a sub-test of the BADS, predicted DEX-TH as accurately as the total BADS. CONCLUSION: The DEX-TH reportings and the MSET can provide valuable information about the severity of daily executive dysfunctioning, with implications for cognitive rehabilitation.",

To achieve better air quality and landscape, planting appropriate grass species in severe SO2 polluted areas is very critical. Cynodon dactylon, a widely used warm season turfgrass species, has good SO2-tolerant ability. In this study, we selected 9 out of 38 C. dactylon accessions from Southwest China as representatives of high, intermediate SO2-tolerant and SO2-sensitive accessions to comparatively analyze their physiological differences in leaves under SO2 untreated and treated conditions. Our results revealed that SO2-tolerant C. dactylon accessions showed higher soluble sugar, proline, and chlorophyll a contents under both SO2 treated and untreated conditions; higher chlorophyll b and carotenoid under SO2 treated condition; lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, oxidative damages, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities under SO2 treated condition; and higher peroxidase (POD) activities under SO2 untreated condition. Further results indicated that SO2-tolerant C. dactylon accessions had higher sulfur contents under both SO2 treated and untreated conditions, consistent with higher SO activities under both SO2 treated and untreated conditions, and higher SiR activities under SO2 treated condition. Taken together, our results indicated that SO2 tolerance of C. dactylon might be largely related to soluble sugar, proline and chlorophyll a contents, and SO enzyme activity.",

        "abstract": "The impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is thought to be an early event in neurodegeneration, and monitoring UPS alterations might serve as a disease biomarker. Our aim was to establish an alternate method to antibody-based assays for the selective measurement of free monoubiquitin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Free monoubiquitin was measured with liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in CSF of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Parkinson's disease (PD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The LC-MS/MS method showed excellent intra- and interassay precision (4.4-7.4% and 4.9-10.3%) and accuracy (100-107% and 100-106%). CSF ubiquitin concentration was increased compared with that of controls (33.0 +/- 9.7 ng/mL) in AD (47.5 +/- 13.1 ng/mL, p < 0.05) and CJD patients (171.5 +/- 103.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001) but not in other neurodegenerative diseases. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of AD vs control patients revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.832, and the specificity and sensitivity were 75 and 75%, respectively. ROC analysis of AD and FTLD patients yielded an AUC of 0.776, and the specificity and sensitivity were 53 and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, our LC-MS/MS method may facilitate ubiquitin determination to a broader community and might help to discriminate AD, CJD, and FTLD patients.",

This approach can lead to nontrivial bounds of the precision for multiphase estimation. Our results show that simultaneous estimation (SE) of multiple phases is always better than individual estimation (IE) of each phase even in noisy environment. The utility of the bounds of multiple phase estimation for photon loss channels is exemplified explicitly. When noise is low, those bounds possess the Heisenberg scale showing quantum-enhanced precision with the O(d) advantage for SE, where d is the number of phases. However, this O(d) advantage of SE scheme in the variance of the estimation may disappear asymptotically when photon loss becomes significant and then only a constant advantage over that of IE scheme demonstrates. Potential application of those results is presented.",

Routine activity theory provides the theoretical perspective. According to routine activity theory, several factors influence the risk of victimization. A multivariate analysis was conducted to assess which factors actually lead to increased risk of victimization. The model included background and financial data of victims, their Internet activities, and the degree to which they were \"digitally accessible\" to an offender. The analysis showed that personal background and financial characteristics play no role in phishing victimization. Among eight Internet activities, only \"targeted browsing\" led to increased risk. As for accessibility, using popular operating systems and web browsers does not lead to greater risk, while having up-to-date antivirus software as a technically capable guardian has no effect. The analysis showed no one, clearly defined group has an increased chance of becoming a victim. Target hardening may help, but opportunities for prevention campaigns aimed at a specific target group or dangerous online activities are limited. Therefore, situational crime prevention will have to come from a different angle. Banks could play the role of capable guardian.",

Our correlational analyses suggest modality-independent relations of the tasks. We also aimed to quantify to what extent executive functioning is meaningful for VWM performances. We therefore estimated the relationship between executive tasks and VWM performances in a healthy (n = 710) and a clinical traumatic brain injury sample (n = 151) as well as in the combined total sample. The results indicate a substantial relevance of the verbal task for VWM performances in the total and the clinical sample but a low relevance in the healthy sample.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis in hospitalized patients is increasing; however, information on the long-term incidence of stroke in patients surviving to discharge after recovering from AKI after dialysis has not been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients that survived after recovery from dialysis-requiring AKI during index hospitalizations from 1999 to 2008 were identified in nationwide administrative registries. The risk of de novo stroke and death were analyzed with time-varying Cox proportional hazard models. The results were validated by a critical care database. We enrolled 4315 patients in the AKI-recovery group (men, 57.7%; mean age, 62.8+/-16.8 years) and matched 4315 control subjects as the non-AKI group by propensity scores. After a median follow-up period of 3.36 years, the incident stroke rate was 15.6 per 1000 person-years. The AKI-recovery group had higher risk (hazard ratio: 1.25; P=0.037) and higher severity of stroke events than the non-AKI group, regardless of progression to subsequent chronic kidney disease. The rate of incident stroke was not statistically different in those with diabetes alone (without AKI) and in those with AKI alone (without diabetes) after hospital discharge (P=0.086). Furthermore, the risk of mortality in the AKI-recovery group was higher than in the non-AKI group (hazard ratio: 2.4; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The patients who recovered from AKI had a higher incidence of developing incident stroke and mortality than the patients without AKI, and the impact was similar to diabetes. Our results suggest that a public health initiative is needed to enhance postdischarge follow-up of renal function and to control the subsequent incidence of stroke among patients who recover from AKI after dialysis.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the load at failure and stiffness associated with three surgical techniques for distal Achilles tendon reconstruction (AT). METHODS: Nine matched pairs of fresh-frozen human cadaveric ATs were divided into three groups. Distal AT reconstruction was performed using suture anchors or one of two lengths of tendon overlap (10 or 5 mm). Each tendon was loaded to failure. The load at failure (N), stiffness (N/mm), and mode of failure were recorded. Differences in load at failure and stiffness were analysed. RESULTS: Mean load at failure was significantly higher in the 10-mm group than in the 5-mm group (p < 0.05) or the suture-anchor group (p < 0.05). Load at failure did not differ significantly between the suture-anchor and 5-mm group, and stiffness did not differ significantly between any two groups. In the 10- and 5-mm groups, failure was caused by the grafts pulling out through the substance of the AT. Modes of failure varied in the suture-anchor group. CONCLUSIONS: The load at failure was higher in the 10-mm group than in the 5-mm and suture-anchor groups. Although all three surgical techniques provide sufficient primary load-bearing ability, the 10-mm tendon-overlap technique may be more conducive to early post-operative rehabilitation.",

To understand the molecular basis of changes in the antigenicity of H3 hemagglutinins (HAs) that have occurred during virus evolution in horses, and to investigate the role of HA in the equine to canine cross-species transfer, we used X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of the HAs from two antigenically distinct equine viruses and from a canine virus. Structurally all three are very similar with the majority of amino acid sequence differences between the two equine HAs located on the virus membrane-distal molecular surface. HAs of canine viruses are distinct in containing a Trp-222 --> Leu substitution in the receptor binding site that influences specificity for receptor analogs. In the fusion subdomain of canine and recent equine virus HAs a unique difference is observed by comparison with all other HAs examined to date. Analyses of site-specific mutant HAs indicate that a single amino acid substitution, Thr-30 --> Ser, influences interactions between N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the subdomain that are important in the structural changes required for membrane fusion activity. Both structural modifications may have facilitated the transmission of H3N8 influenza from horses to dogs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify a contralateral testicular cut-off size that would predict monorchism (intra-abdominal vanishing testis or inguinal/scrotal nubbin) in boys with unilateral nonpalpable testis (NPT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Boys with cryptorchidism, treated by a single surgeon at a tertiary care center from 2009 to 2013, were grouped based on intra-operative findings: boys with a solitary gonad (monorchism group, M) and two control groups: intra-abdominal testis (IAT) and palpable undescended testis (pUDT). Immediately before the procedures, the contralateral descended testes were measured using callipers. Boys with NPT underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. RESULTS: Out of the 324 boys with cryptorchidism, 58 were found to have pUDT and 85 had NPT. Of these 85 boys with NPT, 50 had an IAT and 35 had monorchism. Mean ages at surgery for groups M, IAT and pUDT were similar (28.0, 31.3 and 30.4 months, respectively; P = 0.4). Mean length of the contralateral descended testes in groups M, IAT and pUDT was 24.3, 16.5 and 18.8 mm, respectively. Contralateral testicular cut-off lengths of 18, 19 and 20 mm had positive likelihood ratios (LR+) of 6.5, 7.4 and 10.1, respectively. The area under the ROC curve was 95% (95% CI: 91-100%). CONCLUSION: A contralateral testicular cut-off length of 19-20 mm had the best accuracy in predicting monorchism in boys aged 11-30 months with unilateral NPT.",

        "abstract": "The \"developmental hourglass'' describes a pattern of increasing morphological divergence towards earlier and later embryonic development, separated by a period of significant conservation across distant species (the \"phylotypic stage''). Recent studies have found evidence in support of the hourglass effect at the genomic level. For instance, the phylotypic stage expresses the oldest and most conserved transcriptomes. However, the regulatory mechanism that causes the hourglass pattern remains an open question. Here, we use an evolutionary model of regulatory gene interactions during development to identify the conditions under which the hourglass effect can emerge in a general setting. The model focuses on the hierarchical gene regulatory network that controls the developmental process, and on the evolution of a population under random perturbations in the structure of that network. The model predicts, under fairly general assumptions, the emergence of an hourglass pattern in the structure of a temporal representation of the underlying gene regulatory network. The evolutionary age of the corresponding genes also follows an hourglass pattern, with the oldest genes concentrated at the hourglass waist. The key behind the hourglass effect is that developmental regulators should have an increasingly specific function as development progresses. Analysis of developmental gene expression profiles from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana provide consistent results with our theoretical predictions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Southern Alberta is home to many unique homogeneous communities that typically educate their children in private schools. A number of these communities do not promote immunization as a preventive public health measure, although the reasons behind this vary. People within these communities keep themselves somewhat secluded from other populations and thus do not benefit from overall herd immunity. This has led to frequent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in private schools affiliated with these homogeneous religious communities. OBJECTIVE: To report on low immunization rates of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and MMR-varicella in southern Alberta communities and schools and to compare the epidemiology of immunization rates in certain vulnerable communities with those of same-age cohorts in South Zone communities. METHODS: The analysis includes immunization data at the individual level submitted to the provincial immunization repository, Immunization and Adverse Reactions to Immunization, and the Alberta Health Services Meditech module between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2013. RESULTS: Heterogeneity of immunization status was found among communities and among schools. The status of two year old children up to date on immunizations ranged from 46.6% in Fort Macleod to 71.9% in Oyen, with a mean of 57.3 children in every 100 up to date. By age seven, the mean percentage of immunized children in southern Alberta was 77.6%, ranging from 57.8% in Picture Butte to 94.6% in Oyen. Immunization status among schools ranged from 17% to 100%, with a mean of 89.3% of children fully immunized and a median of 91% immunized. CONCLUSION: There is heterogeneity of immunization uptake for childhood measles-containing vaccine by community and by school in southern Alberta. This study highlights that the location of the school may not align with geographic community as it pertains to immunization rates. Analysis of childhood immunization data at both community and school level is important in understanding the risks of vaccine-preventable illness spread in a given geographic region, such as Alberta South Zone. Data from this study can be used to inform specific interventions required to improve immunization coverage rates in these unique homogeneous cultural communities and their respective schools, and to decrease the risk of measles transmission in Southern Alberta.",

Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum remains a major cause of reproductive morbidity and poor pregnancy outcomes in low income countries. Stillbirth, perinatal death, serious neonatal infection and low-birth weight babies are common among seropositive mothers. OBJECTIVE: To assess the seroprevalence of syphilis and risk factor correlates of this infection at Gondar University Teaching Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was done on 2385 pregnant women attending the antenatal care clinic (ANC) from January 2009 to December 2011. Data was abstracted from the antenatal care clinic medical database. Chi-square test was used, using SPSS version 16 and significance level was chosen at 0.05 level with a two-tailed test. RESULTS: Of the total, 69(2. 9%) of pregnant women were confirmed as seropositive for syphilis. Pregnant women with an age group of 21-25 years of old were the most seropositive (3.4%), followed by 26-30 years of old (3.1%). The prevalence of syphilis infection was 3.2% in urban and 2.2% in rural pregnant women. Relatively high prevalence of syphilis infection were identified among students (4.2%) followed by governmental employees (3.8%). CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of syphilis among pregnant women attending ANC is declining. However, syphilis is more prevalent in the young and urban pregnant women. Emphasis on education to young people on STI risk behavioral change and partner follow up and notification for exposure to syphilis and treatment should be given.",

Under physiological conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role as a signaling molecule in the control of vascular tone and endothelial function. Increased ROS bioavailability is associated with important processes underlying vascular injury in cardiovascular disease such as endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and inflammation. Studies focusing on molecular mechanisms showed a link between overproduction of ROS in the vasculature and ethanol-induced hypertension. Of the ROS generated in vascular cells, superoxide anion (O2(-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) appear to be especially important. Ethanol-mediated generation of O2(-) and H2O2 in vascular tissues is associated with elevations in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i), reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction. O2(-) can also act as a vascular signaling molecule regulating signaling pathways that lead to vascular contraction. Thus, through increased generation of ROS and activation of redox-sensitive pathways, ethanol induces vascular dysfunction, a response that might contribute to the hypertension associated with ethanol consumption. The present article reviews the role of ROS in vascular (patho)biology of ethanol.",

The Institute of Medicine estimates that 100 million Americans have chronic pain with a cost exceeding half a trillion dollars per year. There is a pressing need to identify appropriate outcome measures to better select and evaluate treatment modalities for these patients. It is also important that we demonstrate an evidence basis for these decisions given the current practice standard. Appropriate selection and implementation of these outcome measures can help accomplish both goals. The purpose of this review is to explore the difficulties and opportunities unique to pain outcome measures. The scope of the problem and impetus for implementation of appropriate measures is initially discussed, followed by requisite evaluation criteria for any measurement instrument. The authors then review frequently employed tools for measuring pain outcomes ranging from univariable and single domain scales to multidimensional instruments. A discussion of possible behavioral and objective measures is pursued, as well as measures of statistical and treatment efficacy. The article closes with a review of recent and ongoing efforts to validate and standardize pain outcome measures and suggests directions for future clinical and research assessment.",

We analyse five molecular markers from 85 actiniarians to explore the phylogenetic relationships among families in Acontiaria, including acontiate species assigned to other higher taxa and species without acontia that have been allied to Acontiaria. Based on our results, we redefine the group to accommodate those lineages that have lost acontia, and formalize it as superfamily Metridioidea. Based on stable and well supported clades, we resurrect Phelliidae and Amphianthidae, redefine Kadosactinidae and Actinoscyphiidae, and move two species to new genera: that previously termed Sagartiogeton erythraios belongs in Jasonactis gen. nov.; and that previously termed Anthosactis pearseae belongs in Ostiactis gen. nov., type genus of Ostiactinidae fam. nov. We also synonymized Halcampoididae and Halcampidae (as Halcampidae) and Andvakiidae and Isophelliidae (as Andvakiidae). The results of our phylogenetic analyses indicate that the diagnostic morphological characters used in the family-level taxonomy of acontiate actiniarians such as the nematocysts of the acontia, the marginal sphincter muscle, and mesenteries divisible into macro- and micro-cnemes, have to be revisited, as these features are highly homoplasious.",

Simulations were performed using both long dynamics and umbrella sampling simulations. Angular distributions about the exocyclic C-C bonds and puckering distributions of the rings obtained from the SCC-DFTB model were quite different from those obtained with the AMBER/GLYCAM approach. The joint probability distribution of rotamer and ring puckering parameters reveals further discrepancies, while both methods predict weak correlation between exocyclic torsions and ring puckering. To assess the reliability of the simulations, ensemble-averaged vicinal proton-proton coupling constants ((3)JH,H) were calculated and compared directly to experimental NMR coupling constants. It is found that the (3)JH,H values obtained from the AMBER/GLYCAM simulations agree with experiment, while those obtained from the SCC-DFTB method, in most cases, differ from experimental (3)JH,H values. Potential energy surfaces (PES) along the exocyclic torsion obtained from ab initio and DFT calculations differ significantly from those obtained with the SCC-DFTB method. This study establishes that a high-quality all-atom force field would be more suitable than one of the superior semiempirical methods, SCC-DFTB, for investigation of rotamer populations and ring puckering in floppy ring systems such as furanosides.",

To investigate these differences and qualify the dispersal characteristics of this unique coastal- pelagic teleost (bony fish), we conducted a global phylogeographic survey of 246 specimens from thirteen sampling locations using a 629-base pair fragment of mtDNA cytochrome b. Data indicate high overall gene flow in the Indo-Pacific over large distances (>16,500 km) bridging several biogeographic barriers. The West Atlantic population contains an mtDNA lineage that is divergent from the Indo-Pacific (d = 1.9%), while the East Atlantic (N = 23) has two mutations (d = 0.6%) apart from the Indo-Pacific. While we cannot rule out distinct evolutionary partitions among ocean basins based on behavior, coloration, and near-monophyly between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific subpopulations, more investigation is required before taxonomic status is revised. Overall, the pattern of high global dispersal and connectivity in S. barracuda more closely resembles those reported for large oceanic predators than reef-associated teleosts.",

This report summarizes the safety and tolerability of vilazodone 40 mg/day during short- and long-term treatment of adult MDD. METHODS: Pooled data from two 8-week, double-blind studies of vilazodone (n = 436) vs placebo (n = 433) and data from one 52-week, open-label study (n = 616, vilazodone only) were analyzed. Patients aged 18-70 with DSM-IV-TR-defined MDD received vilazodone or placebo (8-week studies only) once daily, with food, titrated to 40 mg/day over 2 weeks. Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and weight. RESULTS: The most common AEs in all studies were diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Vilazodone-associated AEs in the two 8-week studies, defined as an incidence rate of >/=5% in the vilazodone group and at least twice that for placebo, were diarrhea (28.0% vs 9.2%), nausea (23.4% vs 5.1%), and insomnia (6.0% vs 2.1%), with the majority reported as mild to moderate and <5% of those patients requiring concomitant (directed) treatment for these conditions. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 7.1% (vilazodone) and 3.2% (placebo) in the 8-week studies and 20.7% in the 52-week study. Vilazodone had no clinically significant effects on vital signs, laboratory tests, or electrocardiograms. CONCLUSION: Vilazodone 40 mg/day was well tolerated during short- and long-term MDD treatment in these trials. Safety profiles associated with 8- and 52-week exposure were consistent.",

To date, three types of 5alpha-reductases, chronologically named types 1, 2 and 3 5alpha-reductases (SRD5a-1, 2 and 3) have been described. In the present paper, we characterized the activity and compared the mRNA expression levels of SRD5a-3 with those of SRD5a-1 and 2 in various human tissues, and determined its sensitivity to finasteride and dutasteride. We have established HEK-293 cell line that stably expressed SRD5a-3 for studying its activity and the inhibitory effect of finasteride, using [14C]labeled steroids. mRNA expression levels were quantified using real-time PCR in many male and female human tissues including the prostate, adipose tissue, mammary gland, as well as breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Incubation of HEK-SRD5a-3 cells with [14C]4-androstenedione and [14C]testosterone allowed us to show that SRD5a-3 can catalyze very efficiently both substrates 4-androstenedione and testosterone into 5alpha-androstanedione and dihydrotestosterone, respectively. We observed that the affinity of the enzyme for 4-androstenedione is higher than for testosterone. The activity of SRD5a-3 and SRD5a-2 are similarly sensitive to finasteride, whereas dutasteride is a much more potent inhibitor of SRD5a-3 than SRD5a-2. Tissue distribution analysis shows that SRD5a-3 mRNA expression levels are higher than those of SRD5a-1 and SRD5a-2 in 20 analyzed tissues. In particular, it is highly expressed in the skin, brain, mammary gland and breast cancer cell lines, thus suggesting that SRD5a-3 could play an important role in the production of androgens in these and other peripheral tissues.",

RESULTS: All the procedures were completed by the allocated method of anesthesia, as there were no conversions from spinal to general anesthesia. Pain was significantly less at 4 hours (P<0.0001), 8 hours (P<0.0001), 12 hours (P<0.0001), and 24 hours (P=0.0001) after the procedure for the spinal anesthesia group, compared with those who received general anesthesia. There was no difference between the two groups regarding complications, hospital stay, recovery, or degree of satisfaction at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anesthesia is adequate and safe for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in otherwise healthy patients and offers better postoperative pain control than general anesthesia without limiting the recovery.",

Two of the within-study comparisons are of the four-arm type, and many more are of the three-arm type. To examine unreliability, simulations of differences in reliability are deliberately introduced into the 2 four-arm studies. Results are similar across the samples of studies reviewed with their wide range of non-experimental designs and topic areas. Covariate choice counts most, unreliability next most, and the mode of data analysis hardly matters at all. Unreliability has larger effects the more important a covariate is for bias reduction, but even so the very best covariates measured with a reliability of only .60 still do better than substantively poor covariates that are measured perfectly. Why regression methods do as well as propensity score methods used in several different ways is a mystery still because, in theory, propensity scores would seem to have a distinct advantage in many practical applications, especially those where functional forms are in doubt.",

The results obtained from this method for ethane to hexane dimers are compared with those provided by the MP2 level of theory and the combined Gaussian-3 approach with CCSD(T) being the highest correlation method [G3(CCSD(T))]. Two types of dimer isomers have been studied. The most stable isomers have the two carbon chains in parallel planes, whereas the second ones have the two carbon chains in the same plane. Butane is found to be the shortest carbon chain to form dimers with similar properties, that is, a constant average distance between the monomer carbon skeletons, a similar increment per CH2 unit for the dimer interaction energy, and comparable dimer symmetric stretching frequencies. The values and trends obtained from the DFT-D approach agree very well with those obtained from MP2 for the geometries and vibrational frequencies and from the G3(CCSD(T)) method for the energies, validating the use of DFT-D for the study of large hydrocarbon complexes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this observational study was to provide an impression of the outcomes of prehospital thrombolysis in combination with an active coronary angioplasty intervention (PCI) strategy for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS: In a group of 151 consecutive patients the following parameters were measured: time delay, percentage of reperfusion, reocclusion, stroke, death, need for PCI and the number of protocol violations. RESULTS: The diagnosis by the ambulance paramedics was made in 8+/-6 minutes, followed by thrombolysis in 13+/-7 minutes (median+/-SD). In 2% (3) of the patients the thrombolytic agent was erroneously administered without complications. The elapsed time from onset of symptoms to treatment was a median of 112+/-77 minutes. Five percent (7) of the patients died in the first 30 days and 2% (3) suffered an intracerebral haemorrhage. Reperfusion was documented in 76% (112) of the patients, from which 18% (20) reoccluded in the following 24 hours. In patients where reperfusion was not established or reocclusion occurred, patients underwent rescue/facilitated PCI: in total 37% (55 patients). After three months 9% (13) of the patients had severly impaired (EF <40%) left ventricular function. CONCLUSION: In our region, we successfully implemented the prehospital thrombolysis system achieving a competitive call-to-needle time and reperfusion rate. The percentage of patients who violated the protocol, suffered an intracerebral haemorrhage, died and/or had severely impaired left ventricular function was acceptable.",

        "abstract": "This autopsy-based study investigated the morphological correlates of pulmonary tissue destruction following fatal penetrating gunshot wounds to the lungs using morphometry, histology, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy on whole human lungs fixed-expanded via formalin inflation. As the residue of temporary cavity formation, mantle-like hemorrhagic destruction zones were seen surrounding the missile track that showed an eccentric, conical extension enlarging toward subpleural lung segments. In addition, circumscribed, satellite-like bleeding zones at distances of up to 5.5 cm beyond the border of the permanent cavity were observed that corresponded to interstitial perivascular hemorrhages around larger and smaller pulmonary vessels on the micro-morphological level. These multifocal hemorrhages within macroscopically unaffected parts of pulmonary tissue at some distance from the actual missile track may represent unrecognized, life-threatening intrapulmonary bleeding sources in survivors, potentially leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and progressive lung failure. A further noticeable microscopic and ultrastructural finding was that of club-shaped distensions of ruptured alveolar septa strictly limited to the extent of the temporary cavity. These club-shaped distensions of ruptured alveolar septa seem to represent a special feature of alveolar architectural damage that can be explained by the dynamics of the temporary cavity formation: the radial acceleration and overdistension of tissue during temporary cavitation initiates stretch mechanisms of the displaced tissue, causing the alveolar septa to rupture with subsequent foreshortening and pursing of elastic alveolar fibers.",

The objectives of this study were to identify the fungi associated with grain mold in Morelos, Mexico, and to explore the relationship among planting dates, disease development, and relative humidity and temperature. Fusarium thapsinum was isolated from 97% of the grains from field samples of infested sorghum grains in Morelos, Mexico. The influence of planting dates on the development of sorghum grain mold was determined at Tlayca, Morelos, Mexico, during the rainy seasons of 1998, 1999, and 2000. Incidence of grain mold varied annually, but disease incidence and severity were highest in 1998. Planting dates from 1 June to 13 July had the highest incidence of grain mold during the 3 years. Throughout the study, disease severity was generally low, and yield was not affected. The late planting dates in 1999 and 2000 had reduced yields due to terminal drought of the crop. Increase of disease was predicted by mean temperature, but not by mean relative humidity.",

First, we sampled seedlings in areas where these species had fruited abundantly before the fire, and second, we collected and genotyped mushrooms of S. pungens . *  Neither species was detected on seedlings within the areas sampled, and A. francheti was not detected in any above- or below-ground samples after the fire. Genetic evidence from S. pungens revealed that post-fire genets were small and numerous, and none were found to be identical to the genets sampled prior to the fire. * From these results we conclude that A. francheti was not a common survivor or an early colonist of the post-fire forest, and that spores are the primary means by which S. pungens recolonized.

Significant declines have continued as farmers capture and remove Cheetahs as 'pests'. Established in 1990, the Cheetah Conservation Fund aims to secure habitats for the long-term survival of the species and its ecosystems. The primary focus of the Fund is working outside of the protected reserves with the local livestock farming communities to develop ways to reduce conflict between humans and Cheetahs. The Fund also conducts independent and collaborative research, disseminates information and recommends management techniques to farmers.",

Sensilla include apical hairs of the stylus (STh), hair rows on the ventral part of the valvula (Vh), and distal campaniform sensilla of upper (ULc) and lower (LLc) ovipositor leaves. Backfilling of afferent fibers, using anterograde cobalt fills, reveals the presence of contralaterally projecting fibers for all organs. The main fiber bundle of the LLc enters the terminal ganglion laterally via the genital nerve, but the fibers from ULc enter via the posterior nerve. Main fiber bundles of both leaves end in a lateral part of the ganglion called the lateral neuromere; they demonstrate that sensory information from the two leaves has the same target area. It is hypothesized that the independent pathways of nerves from upper and lower ovipositor leaves (ULc and LLc) may indicate the phylogenetic origin of these appendages from different abdominal segments-the lower leaf from the 8th and upper from 9th. The convergence of afferent fibers from the sensilla of the different ovipositor parts (median, anterior, and lateral processes) in common ganglionic centers may provide the anatomical basis to account for coordination of the movements of different ovipositor parts during oviposition.

        "abstract": "The planarian subepidermal basal lamina consists of three structural elements: namely, an electronlucent zone, a limiting layer, and a microfibrillar layer. Ultrastructural observations following ruthenium red staining were in agreement with previously published reports. The staining clearly revealed positive material on the limiting layer and the individual microfibrils. The limiting layer was continuous and separated the electronlucent zone from the microfibrillar layer. The distribution of laminin, a noncollagenous basal lamina glycoprotein, was determined for the planarian basal lamina using various methods of immunocytochemistry. The reactive substance appeared only on the limiting layer and in the electronlucent zone along the limiting layer. The reactive products on the limiting layer appeared discontinuous. They were also present in the regenerated basal lamina, though the reactivity was a little weaker than in that of intact animals. Localization of laminin in the planarian subepidermal basal lamina is discussed in comparison with that of the basal lamina of vertebrates.",

It has also been difficult to explain the variation in results reported by different groups using the same implant. One hypothesis asserts that the above differences can be explained by the observation that electric stimulation with an implanted electrode might result in two different auditory sensations, the first resulting from the stimulation of the remaining hair cells (electrophonic component) and the second from the electric stimulation of the auditory nerve (electro-neural component). The two sensations are very different. As a result of different definitions of total deafness (functional or threshold definition), patients with remaining hair cells are operated on by some groups, but not by other groups. Some published results from different studies are discussed with reference to the above hypothesis and the possible consequences for the selection of the patients, the use of extra-or intracochlear electrodes, and the selection of the speech coding strategy are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews some characteristic features of membrane fusion activity for each virus and discusses the mechanisms of membrane fusion, especially low pH-induced membrane fusion. It concentrates on the interaction of the hydrophobic segment with the target cell membrane lipid bilayer and suggests the entrance of the segment into the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core as a key step in fusion. The envelope is a lipid bilayer membrane with the virus specific glycoproteins spanning it. The bilayer originates from the host cell membrane and has a lipid composition and transbilayer distribution quite similar to the host's. The viral glycoproteins have the functions of binding to the target cell surface and fusion with the cell membranes. The two functions are carried by a single glycoprotein in influenza virus (HA), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein, and Semliki Forest virus SFV E glycoprotein. In Sendai virus (HVJ), the functions are carried by separate glycoproteins, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) for binding and fusion glycoprotein (F) for fusion. When viruses encounter target cells, they first bind to the cell surface through an interaction of the viral glycoprotein with receptors.",

        "abstract": "Genetic models and computer simulations suggest that modifications of incompatibility in tristylous populations of Oxalis alpina from southeastern Arizona should result in evolution of distyly, due to the inability of the mid floral morph to compete effectively with the short and long floral morphs. To evaluate this hypothesis, progeny testing of naturally pollinated individuals was carried out over a three-year period for populations with differing mid frequencies. In contrast to expectations, mids appeared in greater than expected proportions in many cases. Detailed analysis of results from two trimorphic populations where the mid form is relatively uncommon revealed that mid morphs produced far more mid progeny among their offspring than expected. Assuming that all compatible pollen has the same probability of deposition on appropriate stigmas, mid excesses were found among progeny of shorts and longs in these populations as well. In a third population where the mid form is abundant, mid excesses were not found among the progeny of mids, nor were mid excesses typical among the progeny of shorts and longs. Mid excesses among progeny of populations where the mid form is uncommon may explain retention of this form, despite incompatibility modifications that should favor evolution of distyly. Over-representation of mids may result from gametophytic selection favoring mid alleles. If this is the case, tristylous populations may be in equilibrium, with the frequencies of the three morphs determined by the balance of the opposing selective forces resulting from incompatibility modifications and gametophytic selection.",

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using the intracarotid (133)xenom method in halothane/nitrous oxide anaesthetised animals. Captopril given either way did not influence the absolute value of CBF. The main finding, however, was that following intravenous administration of captopril at a dose af 10 mg/kg, both the lower pressure limit of CBF autoregulation were shifted to lower pressure and the autoregulatory plateau shortened. The lower limit was shifted 20-30 mm Hg, the upper limit 50-60 mm Hg, andthr autoregulatory plateau consequently shortened by 20-30 mm Hg. In contrast to the marked effects of intrvenous captopril, intracerebroventricular captopril was without effect on CBF autoreguletion. The effect of intravenous captopril was thus probably mediatedby converting enzyme in the cerebrovascular endothelium."
