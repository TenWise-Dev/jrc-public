<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Alpers' syndrome is an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder usually caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of polymerase-gamma (POLG), which is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. The disease is progressive, incurable, and inevitably it leads to death from drug-resistant status epilepticus. The neurological features of Alpers' syndrome are intractable epilepsy and developmental regression, with no effective treatment; the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, partially due to lack of good experimental models. Here, we generated the patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from one Alpers' patient carrying the compound heterozygous mutations of A467T (c.1399G&gt;A) and P589L (c.1766C&gt;T), and further differentiated them into cortical organoids and neural stem cells (NSCs) for mechanistic studies of neural dysfunction in Alpers' syndrome. Patient cortical organoids exhibited a phenotype that faithfully replicated the molecular changes found in patient postmortem brain tissue, as evidenced by cortical neuronal loss and depletion of mtDNA and complex I (CI). Patient NSCs showed mitochondrial dysfunction leading to ROS overproduction and downregulation of the NADH pathway. More importantly, the NAD + precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) significantly ameliorated mitochondrial defects in patient brain organoids. Our findings demonstrate that the iPSC model and brain organoids are good in vitro models of Alpers' disease; this first-in-its-kind stem cell platform for Alpers' syndrome enables therapeutic exploration and has identified NR as a viable drug candidate for Alpers' disease and, potentially, other mitochondrial diseases with similar causes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Alpers' syndrome, a devastating early-onset neurodegenerative disorder is tightly linked to abnormalities in the function of mitochondria and mutations in the catalytic subunit of polymerase gamma (POLG) gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The syndrome, which typically follows an autosomal mode of inheritance, manifests a range of debilitating symptoms including intractable seizures, developmental regression, hypotonia, ataxia, and liver failure. In some severe instances, it can lead to premature death <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Symptoms usually emerge between first and third years of life, with the disorder estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 newborns <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, Alpers' syndrome's pathogenesis remains obscure, making the development of direct treatment modalities challenging. Consequently, current interventions focus on symptomatic relief and providing supportive care. Certain drugs previously utilized, like valproic acid, are now largely discarded due to their severe hepatotoxic effects and persistence of drug-resistant epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. This underlines the crucial need for continuing research into the root cause of Alpers' syndrome, which would pave the way for devising strategies to limit disease progression and generate efficacious treatments.</p><p>The POLG gene, situated on the long arm of chromosome 15, encodes for polymerase γ, an enzyme chiefly responsible for replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. More than 90% of Alpers' syndrome cases are linked to mutations in the POLG gene. These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, often from parents who are asymptomatic carriers. The mutations commonly observed include homozygous p.A467T or p.W748S transitions and heterozygous p.T851A and p.R1047W mutations, all of which impact the function and phenotypic manifestation of polymerase γ (Pol γ) A gradual deficiency in Pol γ contributes directly to mtDNA depletion, instigating serious harm to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, particularly leading to the breakdown of CI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. The ensuing severe mitochondrial dysfunction manifests as ataxia, hepatic failure, and even premature death. Since Alpers' syndrome is a metabolic disorder, deepening our understanding of its pathogenesis could pave the way for a more comprehensive grasp of mitochondrial metabolism. This could potentially open new avenues for more effective treatments.</p><p>Unraveling the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alpers' disease, is a complex task due largely to the intricacy of the human nervous system. To date, most research efforts have relied on genetically modified cell lines that is limited to relatively single immortalized cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or rodent primary neural stem cells (NSCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. However, these models may not adequately represent the multifaceted in vivo microenvironment of the human body. In vivo studies using animal models provide a simplified, cost-effective approach to neurodegeneration research. Nevertheless, their applicability is constrained due to inherent differences between human and animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, neuroprotective drugs showing promise in animal models often disappoint when tested in human clinical trials. Given these limitations, there is an urgent need for a more accurate disease model that truly emulates the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Such a model could unlock insights into disease mechanisms and expedite the development of effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Introduced by Shinya Yamanaka in 2007, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have emerged as a promising source of cells for in vitro studies and clinical applications in humans and patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. This innovative approach reverts human somatic cells, such as skin fibroblasts or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, back to a pluripotent state using various combinations of transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. iPSCs derived from specific diseases can retain the patient's individual genetic mutations and avoid potential interspecies variation, offering a tremendous tool to study neurodegenerative diseases at the cellular level <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. To date, patient-specific iPSCs have been extensively utilized in the creation of diverse neuronal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and in the exploration of mitochondrial diseases caused by mtDNA mutations, such as Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS) syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged-Red Fibers (MERRF) syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Pearson syndrome (PS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. However, most cellular assays primarily rely on traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems, which are increasingly recognized as inadequate for mimicking complex natural environments. Recent evidence supports the idea that three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems, such as brain organoids derived from iPSCs, could address this limitation effectively. These 3D systems accurately reflect in vivo microenvironment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, providing robust models to emulate the disease profiles of neurodegenerative disease and conduct drug testing.</p><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its oxidized form (NAD + ) is a vital molecule for life and health, playing a particularly crucial role in neuroprotection. NAD + 's fundamental molecular functions extend beyond its roles in energy metabolism and production, including glycolysis, β-oxidation, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation <ref type="bibr">(OXPHOS)</ref>. It also contributes to cellular repair and resilience, factors that underpin its ability to protect the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Research conducted on postmortem brain tissues, iPSC-derived cells, and animal models indicates a decline in NAD + levels in the aging brain, as well as in prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The belief that the reduction in NAD + is a primary cause, rather than a simple correlate, is bolstered by evidence showing that NAD + augmentation-achieved through supplementation with NAD + precursors like as nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), can alleviate disease pathologies in laboratory models of these diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Notably, clinical studies have demonstrated that NR is not only safe (up to 2 g/day for up to 3 months) and bioavailable, but it can also ameliorate some syndromes in patients with PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>To date, there has been a few reported uses of the iPSCs model for the study of Alpers' syndrome resulting from POLG mutation, and focused only on iPSCs and derived 2D neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. In this study, we established an iPSCs model of Alpers' syndrome, generated from the skin fibroblasts of one Alpers' patient. These cells were further differentiated into NSCs and 3D cortical to investigate the varied manifestations and pathogenesis of Alpers' disease. Both the iPSCs and NSCs derived from Alpers' patients exhibited some degree of mitochondrial dysfunction, the dysfunction being more pronounced in NSCs.</p><p>With the use of a cortical organoid model derived from iPSCs, we found that the mitochondrial alterations in the cortical organoids from Alpers' patient mirrored those observed in 2D NSCs. Additionally, a transcriptomic analysis revealed a downregulation of the NADH pathway and reduced expression of mitochondrial transcripts in both reprogrammed iPSCs and induced NSCs. This provided key insights into potential therapeutic approaches. Notably, subsequent studies in the cortical organoid model demonstrated that NR significantly rectified the structural disruptions and mitochondrial defects in brain organoids generated from an Alpers' syndrome patient. For the first time, we have constructed a stem cell model for Alpers' syndrome, paving the way for precise mechanistic studies and the exploration of potential drug development for this currently incurable disease.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alpers's iPSCs manifested a mild impairment of mitochondrial function compared to controls</head><p>We generated iPSCs from a patient with Alpers' syndrome (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The clinical manifestations of the patients were characterized by recurrent seizure, psychomotor regression and liver dysfunction. Gene mutation analysis showed that the patient carried heterozygous mutations A467T (c.1399G&gt;A) and P589L (c.1766C&gt;T). POLG gene mutations are located in the linker region that is in close proximity to the auxiliary subunit (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). To validate the pluripotency and cellular purity of the iPSCs, we utilized flow cytometry, which confirmed that over 97% of the iPSCs derived from Alpers' patient expressed the pluripotent marker NANOG (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Fluorescent staining further confirmed that the iPSC colonies expressed the pluripotent markers OCT4 and SSEA4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Sanger sequencing analysis corroborated that two mutations present in the iPSCs were consistent with those identified in the patient (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). We utilized five individual clones from three control lines, three clones derived from control Detroit 551 fibroblasts, one clone from CRL2097 fibroblasts and one clone from AG AG05836, as disease-free controls. We observed that the iPSCs derived from Alpers' patient exhibited typical colony morphology, similar to the control iPSCs (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). To evaluate pluripotency and tri-lineage differentiation, we quantified the expression of relevant genes via RNA sequencing analysis. We found positive expressions of the pluripotent markers NANOG and KLF4; endoderm markers CXCR4 and GATA4; mesoderm markers TBX6, MSX1, OTX2, MESP1, SOX2, and MIXL1; and ectoderm markers NCAM1, TBX6, MSX1, OTX2, MESP1, and SOX2. These markers were expressed in both the control line (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and the Alpers line (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>To determine if there were changes in mitochondrial function in iPSCs reprogrammed from Alpers' patient fibroblasts, we assessed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass, ROS levels and intracellular energy production. Mitochondrial mass and MMP were measured. Each was measured by flow cytometry after double-staining cells with MitoTracker Green (MTG) and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). To gauge MMP levels per mitochondrion, we measure the ratio between total MMPs and MTG, providing relative measurements of specific MMPs. iPSCs for pluripotent markers OCT4 and SSEA4.

However, specific MMPs did not differ statistically (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). ROS production was analyzed using 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and MitoTracker Deep Red (MTDR) double staining and flow cytometry. Alpers' iPSCs produced less total ROS than the control iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>). After normalizing total ROS by measuring mitochondrial mass MTDR, no difference was observed in ROS production per mitochondria (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I</ref>). Furthermore, total mitochondrial ROS measured by a mitochondrial ROS (mito-ROS)-sensitive fluorescent dye, did not differ between Alpers' and control iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>). When normalized by MTG, specific mito-ROS levels remained statistically indistinct (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1K</ref>).</p><p>ATP production per cell was assessed using a luminescence assay, revealing no difference in ATP levels between Alpers' and control iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1L</ref>). Moreover, to explore glycolysis activity in Alpers' iPSCs, we measured L-lactate levels and found them to be higher in Alpers' iPSCs compared to the control group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1M</ref>).</p><p>To further investigate the mtDNA copy number, we employed flow cytometry to indirectly mtDNA copy number by examining the levels of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and mtDNA, both of which are bound together in molar amounts. We also sought to determine the mtDNA copy number per mitochondria by performing double staining with the mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM20 (TOMM20) and then calculating the ratio of TFAM to TOMM20. Our findings revealed no significant difference in the expression of TFAM and TOMM20 proteins between the patient and control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1N,</ref><ref type="figure">O</ref>).</p><p>Given the known association of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex deficiency with POLG mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we evaluated whether this also the case in iPSCs derived from Alpers' patient. We did this by using antibodies against the CI subunit NDUFB10 for measurement of CI level, the complex IV subunit COXIV to assess mitochondrial complex IV (CIV) level, and TOMM20 to quantify the mitochondrial volume. Following this, we applied flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that both total levels of NDUFB10 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1P</ref>) and specific levels of NDUFB10 when normalized to TOMM20 levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1Q</ref>) were significantly reduced in Alpers' iPSCs. We did not find any significant changes in the total (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) and specific CIV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1R</ref>) or the total TOMM20 level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1N</ref>) in Alpers' iPSCs compared to control iPSCs.</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that we can successfully generate iPSCs from a patient with Alpers' syndrome and that the iPSCs derived from the patient exhibit mild mitochondrial alterations, including an elevated L-lactate level and a depletion of CI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alpers' NSCs showed more severe impairment of mitochondrial function compared to controls</head><p>Continuing our investigations, we utilized a method from previous research to further differentiate iPSCs into NSCs, and then conducted the same experiments as before to evaluate alterations in mitochondrial function in these NSCs. Alpers' NSCs were observed to display a conventional neural stem cell morphology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and an unaltered mitochondrial double cristae morphology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The NSCs, derived from iPSCs, showed the positive expression of neural stem cell markers, Nestin and SOX2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Utilizing flow cytometry, it was established that over 93% and 87% of Alpers' NSCs expressed Nestin and SOX2, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</p><p>Using the same TMRE/MTG double staining method as we did for iPSCs, it was found that specific MMPs were decreased in Alpers' NSCs compared to controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). However, no significant variation was observed in total MMPs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>) and mitochondrial volume, as indicated by MTG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). For Alpers' NSCs, a significant increase was observed in specific intracellular ROS (DCFDA/ MTDR) and mitochondrial ROS at both total (MitoSOX Red) and specific level (MitoSOX Red/MTG) when compared to control NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I,</ref><ref type="figure">J,</ref><ref type="figure">K</ref>), yet the total intracellular ROS (DCFDA/ MTDR) showed no difference (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). A direct measurement of intracellular ATP production revealed a marked decrease in ATP production in Alpers' NSCs compared to the control NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2L</ref>), whereas the L-lactate levels were found to be higher in Alpers' NSCs than in controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2M</ref>).

The numbers of clones and replications in each experiment was listed in Table <ref type="table">S</ref> 13.</p><p>In addition, we utilized indirect methods TFAM measurement and qPCR to evaluate the mtDNA levels of ND1/APP. Using flow cytometry, we discerned a marked decline in specific TFAM levels (TFAM/TOMM20) in Alpers' NSCs compared to controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2O</ref>). Interestingly, we didn't observe any significant alterations in the levels of TOMM20 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2N</ref>). To corroborate the reduction in the mtDNA levels as observed through the ND1/APP measurements in Alpers' NSCs, we performed qPCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2P</ref>), which confirmed the same. Further assessments of OXPHOS complexes I, II, and IV using flow cytometry revealed significantly decreased expression, both in terms of the total level and specificity of CI (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2Q</ref>, R) and CIV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2U,</ref><ref type="figure">V</ref>) in Alpers' NSCs compared to control NSCs. However, we did not notice any significant changes in the total (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2S</ref>) and specific level of complex II (CII) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2T</ref>). This body of evidence collectively suggests that NSCs in Alpers' syndrome are distinguished by profound mtDNA depletion and resultant mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mitochondrial-related pathways were downregulated in Alpers' derived iPSCs and NSCs, and more pronounced in NSCs</head><p>To delve deeper into the comparison of transcriptome and gene alterations between Alpers' and control lines, we executed a transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on both iPSCs and induced NSCs derived from Alpers' and controls. Hierarchical clustering based on RNA transcripts displayed unique, independent clusters for NSCs and iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) authenticated the separation between NSCs and iPSCs, with the difference between Alpers' NSCs and control NSCs being more conspicuous than those between iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). The differential expression analysis unveiled that 1805 genes were upregulated, and 1905 genes were downregulated in Alpers' iPSCs compared with the control iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</p><p>Relative to controls, Alpers' NSCs displayed 2725 upregulated genes and 4059 downregulated genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). KEGG pathway analysis based on DEGs disclosed a downregulation of the mitochondrial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase pathway in both Alpers' derived iPSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>, E, and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) and NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) compared to control cells. Interestingly, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis pathways were markedly upregulated in Alpers' NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), indicating that glycolysis might be compensating for energy production in Alpers' NSCs, a phenomenon providing indirect evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, Alpers' iPSCs and NSCs exhibited significantly lower levels of mitochondrial transcripts, encompassing ATP6, ATP8, CO1, CO2, CO3, CYB, ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, and ND5, relative to controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>). This observation aligns with the previously demonstrated mtDNA depletion in NSCs derived from Alpers' patients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2O</ref>, P).</p><p>Our finding showed an increase in ROS production in Alpers' NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2K</ref>). Given that the balance between ROS production and the cellular antioxidant defense system is vital for maintaining redox homeostasis, and any disruption in this balance can lead to oxidative stress, we further assessed the antioxidant capacity of NSCs using the scRNA-seq analysis. We found that the expression of several key antioxidant genes was significantly altered, which indicates a response to the increased ROS production in Alpers' NSCs (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>). Notably, the expression of genes such as CAT, GPX1, GPX4, SOD1, and TXNRD1 was downregulated, as suggested by their negative log2 fold-change values. This downregulation implies a compromised cellular antioxidant defense capacity, which could exacerbate oxidative stress due to the inability to effectively neutralize the increased ROS levels. However, other genes, including SOD2 and PRDX5, showed a significant upregulation, indicating that while some components of the antioxidant system are suppressed, others are activated, possibly as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate oxidative damage. The upregulation of SOD2 is particularly relevant as it encodes mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, which suggests an enhanced defense against mitochondrial ROS. The gene GPX3 showed the most significant downregulation, which implies a substantial decrease in the corresponding glutathione peroxidase activity, an enzyme critical for detoxifying peroxides. The dramatic decrease in GPX3 expression may be a key factor in the increased vulnerability to oxidative stress observed in Alpers' NSCs. Interestingly, genes such as HMOX1 and NQO1, which are involved in the response to oxidative stress and are regulated by the transcription factor NRF2, were upregulated. This suggests that the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway may be activated in these cells. Given our findings on the significant reductions in mitochondrial CI, III, IV protein levels, and mtDNA transcripts in Alpers' NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2O-V</ref>) and that these could act as potential precursors to cellular stress leading to apoptosis, we further compared the anti-and pro-apoptotic genes as well as stress response pathway genes Alpers' NSCs versus controls. We found significant changes in the expression of several key apoptotic and stress response genes (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). CASP3, CASP9, and CYCS, which are key players in the apoptotic process, showed decreased expression as indicated by the negative log2 fold-change values. This downregulation suggests a reduced activation of apoptosis through both intrinsic mitochondrial pathways (as seen with CASP9 and CYCS) and the execution phase (as noted with CASP3). On the other hand, anti-apoptotic genes such as BCL2, BCL2L1, and MCL1 exhibited increased expression, suggesting a potential cellular response to mitigate the induction of apoptosis. The upregulation of these genes might be a compensatory mechanism to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction and maintain cellular viability. The BAX gene, a pro-apoptotic member, is also downregulated, which aligns with the observed trend of reduced pro-apoptotic activity. Surprisingly, BID, another pro-apoptotic gene, showed increased expression, which could suggest a complex and nuanced response to the mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the activation of stress response pathways is evident from the increased expression of genes such as ATF4 and DDIT3, which are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The upregulation of these genes indicates that the cells may be undergoing stress likely related to the mitochondrial dysfunction observed. In addition, the enrichment in the upregulated DEGs further demonstrated the upregulation of gene expressions in crucial apoptotic pathways within Alpers' NSCs (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>). Particularly, the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, as a reaction to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and its negative regulation pathway are profoundly enriched, which may reflect an intensified stress response and potential dysregulation in homeostatic mechanisms. The regulatory pathways of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis show significant changes, indicative of the complex nature of apoptotic dysregulation in Alpers' disease. The observable gene upregulations within the oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway included the key regulators such as NOXA, BAK1, BAX, PUMA, APAF1, TRAF2, and UQCRH (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>). Taken together, this body of evidence proposes that mitochondrial-associated pathways are downregulated in both iPSCs and NSCs derived from Alpers' patient, with these alterations being more accentuated in NSCs. Additionally, altered expression of antioxidant and apoptotic genes indicates an adaptive response to increased ROS production and potential compensatory mechanisms to mitigate apoptosis and maintain cellular viability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alpers' cortical organoids demonstrated cortical neuronal loss and astrocyte accumulation</head><p>In our next step, we delved deeper into the mitochondrial changes in 3D cortical brain development, employing a cortical organoid model. This is a relatively complex 3D model that more accurately replicates the microenvironment and structure of the human brain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Using a previously documented procedure, we transformed iPSCs into cortical organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. By days 40-50, these cortical organoids had matured into large (2-3 mm in diameter) and complex heterogeneous tissues (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). At day 40, brain organoids presented intricate morphology, including cortical folded surfaces and sulci, and expressed the mature neural marker MAP2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>), neonatal neural marker tubulin β III (Tuj1), ventricular zone (VZ) marker SOX2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref> and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). By day 90, a majority of neurons in the organoids were positive for mature neural marker NeuN in outer layers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref> and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>). Additionally, a minor fraction of cells in the organoids were GFAP positive (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>, G and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>). Furthermore, the cortical pyramidal neuronal marker CTIP2 and SATB2 were also expressed in the upper layers and middle layer of the organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref> and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>), demonstrating that the organoids' resemblance to cortical neurons.</p><p>We then generated cortical organoids from iPSCs from Alpers' patient. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated the neural marker MAP2 expression, neural progenitor marker SOX2 and astrocyte marker GFAP (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8,</ref><ref type="figure">9</ref>) with clear neural rosette structures (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>), indicating the succeed of generation of Alpers' patient cortical organoids. When compared to controls, Alpers' organoids exhibited irregular folding without typical cortical layers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref> and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>). This suggested abnormal cortical development in Alpers' organoids. Upon performing immunofluorescent staining of cortical organoids, we found that while normal control cortical organoids formed a typical cortical layer structure characterized by prominent cortical neurons, including SATB2-and CTIP2-positive neurons. Further quantification of cortical neurons, as well as NeuN and mature neurons in mature cortical organoids (day 90) revealed significantly lower expression of SATB2 and CTIP2 in Alpers' organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B,</ref><ref type="figure">C,</ref><ref type="figure">G,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>) and the level of all neural marker MAP2, NeuN and Tuj1 expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C,</ref><ref type="figure">D,</ref><ref type="figure">E,</ref><ref type="figure">F,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>, L and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14</ref>) was also lower in Alpers' organoids than in, confirming a loss of cortical neurons in Alpers' cortical organoids. Meanwhile, we observed an increase in SOX2-positive neural progenitors in Alpers' organoids compared with controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D,</ref><ref type="figure">K</ref>). Previous studies have indicated that loss of mtDNA leads to a reactive increase in astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. To further explore an astrocyte differentiation in Alpers' organoids, we examined the number of astrocytes in mature cortical organoids (day 90) and found that the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in Alpers' organoids was significantly higher than in controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>, D, J and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14</ref>). This suggests that astrogliosis accompanying cortical neuronal loss is a characteristic of cortical brain pathology in Alpers' disease. Additionally, we used immunofluorescence to measure mitochondrial markers and discovered significantly reduced levels of the CI subunit NDUFB10, TFAM as a measurement of mtDNA copy numbers, and mitochondrial mass marker VDAC in Alpers' organoids compared to the controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>, M and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>). These results affirm our ability to differentiate 3D cortical organoids from iPSCs derived from Alpers' patient, demonstrating that these organoids recapitulate disease-specific pathological and molecular features similar to those observed in the patient's brain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alpers' cortical organoids exhibited significant downregulation of mitochondrial and synaptogenesis-related pathways, while there was an upregulation of pathways associated with astrocyte/glial cells and neuroinflammation</head><p>To further explore regulatory pathways in Alpers' cortical organoids, we performed RNA-seq analysis on both Alpers' and control organoids. We selected 90-day-old cortical organoids for this analysis because, as mentioned earlier, they display a relatively mature state with a layered structure of cortical neurons and glial cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, G, I and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). The PCA analysis demonstrated that Alpers' and control organoids formed distinct clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>), suggesting a divergence in expression profiles between the two groups. DEGs analysis revealed 1440 differentially expressed genes, with 1010 genes being up-regulated and 430 genes down-regulated in Alpers' organoids compared to the control group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). Furthermore, when comparing the expression of mitochondrial transcripts in the Alpers' group to the control group, significant decreases in the expressions of MT-CO2, MT-CYB, MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND5 were noted in Alpers' organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>).</p><p>Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results indicated that Alpers' organoids exhibited substantial downregulation of mitochondrial and synaptogenesis-related pathways. This includes mitochondrial-related pathways including mitochondrial CI, mitochondrial electron transport, mitochondrial tRNA processing, and mitochondrial localization and trafficking (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>), as well as axonal trafficking and synapse-related pathways including presynaptic transmission, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and postsynaptic receptor activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). GABAergic neurons, inhibitory interneurons crucial in preventing epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, showed marked downregulation of their synaptic transmission pathway in Alpers' cortical organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), indicating pathological changes of GABAergic neurons in Alpers' disease. The immunostaining results for the interneuron marker GAD 65 align with this, as there was a notable reduction in GAD 65 expression in the organoids derived from Alpers' patient, compared to the controls (refer to Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16</ref>). Moreover, astrocyte-and glial-related pathways were upregulated in Alpers' cortical organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6F</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>), consistent with the immunostaining findings described earlier (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D,</ref><ref type="figure">J</ref>). Intriguingly, cortical organoids from Alpers' patient also demonstrated an up-regulation of neuroinflammatory pathways (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6G</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that Alpers' cortical organoids display a distinct transcriptomic profile, characterized by the downregulation of mitochondrial and synaptogenesis-related pathways and upregulation of astrocyte/glial-related and neuroinflammatory pathways.</p></div>

We observed that the NR-treated organoids exhibited organized structures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>) and increased expression of MAP2 and Tuj1 compared to those untreated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C,</ref><ref type="figure">D,</ref><ref type="figure">K,</ref><ref type="figure">L</ref>), alongside an elevation in the cortical neural markers SATB2 and CTIP2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C,</ref><ref type="figure">E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). Interestingly, a decrease in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was noticed post NR treatment when compared to untreated organoids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7G,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>). Immunostaining of the mitochondrial markers showed a marked rise in NDUFB10 expression and TFAM level, but decreased VDAC expression after the treatment with NR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7K</ref>, M and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">17</ref>). The expression of the interneuron marker, GAD 65, demonstrated a significant increase following treatment with NR, as evidenced by immunostaining (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">18</ref>).</p><p>An RNA-seq analysis was performed to identify genetic changes before and after NR treatment. PCA demonstrated that NR treatment altered the RNA expression profile of Alpers' organoids significantly, moving it closer to that of healthy controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8A</ref>). GSEA showed that NR treatment was able to reverse the dysregulated pathways that were identified in Alpers' patient organoids. While mtDNA RNA levels did not see a significant rise with NR treatment (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19</ref>), we noted an up-regulation in the activity of pathways related to mitochondrial function, such as mitochondrial electron transport, proton transport ATP synthase complex, mitochondrial transport along microtubules and axons, and mitophagy in response to mitochondrial depolarization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8B</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>).</p><p>Further, patient organoids treated with NR demonstrated an upregulation of pathways associated with synapses, including postsynaptic pathways (membrane assembly, endosomal and neurotransmitter receptor activity), inhibitory neuronal pathways (regulator of GABAergic synaptic transmission, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials), and synaptic vesicles (synaptic vesicle aggregation and trafficking) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8C</ref>, F and Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>). In contrast, astrocyte and glial cell pathways were downregulated after NR treatment, including astrocyte development, glial cell activation, glial cell fate commitment, and pathways negatively regulating astrocyte/glial cell differentiation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8D</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>).

In our research, we converted fibroblasts from an Alpers' syndrome patient with POLG mutations into iPSCs, and then into NSCs and 3D cortical organoids. These models successfully replicated the patient's brain pathology, showing mitochondrial DNA depletion and CI deficiency. In addition, the 3D cortical organoids manifested changes akin to those observed in the patient's cerebral cortex, including cortical neuronal loss and astrogliosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. This approach led to new insights into the disease mechanisms, such as increased ROS production and faulty NAD + metabolism. Notably, NAD + supplementation improved these conditions, offering potential avenues for future diagnostics and treatments in POLG-related diseases.</p><p>Coupled with our finding of decreased mtDNA transcript levels in Alpers' iPSCs, the reduced CI levels exhibited in the Alper's iPSCs suggests that mtDNA depletion in these Alpers' does not result in significant mitochondrial dysfunction. One possible explanation for this observation is iPSCs' higher reliance on glycolysis for iPSC energy productivity than oxidative phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Given that neuronal cells, including NSCs, rely more heavily on mitochondrial OXPHOS for their energy needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, iPSCs from Alpers manifested a more pronounced impairment of mitochondrial function upon differentiated into neurons. In these Alpers NSCs we observed a lower MMP, decreased ATP production, and elevated ROS generation. We also noted significant reductions in mitochondrial CI, III, IV protein levels and mtDNA transcripts. As potential precursors to cellular stress leading to apoptosis, decreased levels of mtDNA transcripts may play a key role in the development of neurological diseases. Our research thus illustrates that the impacts of mtDNA loss in Alpers' mutations start to become evident upon differentiation into NSCs. This indicates that NSCs serve as an effective model for studying diseases related to Alpers' mutations.</p><p>Our results also highlight the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the induction of apoptosis in Alpers' NSCs. The observed downregulation of key pro-apoptotic genes (CASP3, CASP9, and CYCS) alongside the upregulation of anti-apoptotic factors (BCL2, BCL2L1, MCL1) suggests that Alpers' NSCs may initiate adaptive mechanisms to counteract the mitochondrial impairment and the consequent elevation in ROS production. These adaptations appear to temporally mitigate the activation of apoptosis, potentially delaying cell death. Moreover, the upregulation of genes regulated by the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway (HMOX1, NQO1) further supports the notion that NSCs are actively engaging in defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. The significant downregulation of mitochondrial CI, III, IV protein levels and mtDNA transcripts could contribute to a bioenergetic crisis that exacerbates the vulnerability of Alpers' NSCs, reinforcing the need for reliance on alternative metabolic pathways such as glycolysis.</p><p>The analysis of transcriptomic data in Alpers' organoids disclosed a significant decrease in the expression of mtDNA transcripts within Alpers' organoids and the downregulation of mitochondrialassociated pathways, findings that align with those derived from NSCs. Of note, neuron-and synapse-related pathways demonstrated significant down-regulated, with GABAergic inhibition of neuron-related synaptic pathways being particularly affected. This suggests that neuronal interconnections may be compromised in Alpers' syndrome, a conclusion that aligns with previous findings regarding brain pathology in Alpers' patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. These results propose that cortical neuronal loss, as a secondary effect to mtDNA depletion and compromised ATP export in Alpers' patients, might contribute to central nervous system symptoms observed in these patients, including epilepsy and dementia.</p><p>The irregular morphology, atypical cortical layers, and irregular folding of Alpers' organoids underscore aberrant cortical development, potentially contributing to the clinical manifestation of Alpers' syndrome. A significant reduction of cortical neuronal marker and mature neural marker in the organoids signifying the loss of cortical neurons. Additionally, the overexpression of SOX2-positive neural progenitors and an increased number of GFAP-positive astrocytes point towards astrogliosis in the context of cortical neuronal loss, a hallmark of brain pathology in Alpers' syndrome. These findings align with the understanding that Alpers' syndrome is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the premature loss of neurons, particularly within the cortex, and the concurrent proliferation of astrocytes (a process known as astrogliosis) in response to neuronal damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Further, the reduced expression of CI subunit NDUFB10 strengthens the notion of impaired mitochondrial function in Alpers' disease, which aligns with findings from previous studies conducted on postmortem brain tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>The differential gene expression observed through RNA-seq analysis gives a more detailed view of the altered molecular landscape within Alpers' organoids. PCA revealed a clear distinction in gene expression profiles between Alpers' and control organoids. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the distinct genetic signatures associated with neurodegenerative disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, including Alpers' syndrome. Of particular note, the downregulation of mitochondrial transcripts implies impaired mitochondrial function in Alpers' disease, in agreement with the postulated role of mitochondrial dysfunction in this condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The GSEA further uncovered dysregulated pathways in Alpers' organoids. The downregulation of mitochondrial and synaptogenesis-related pathways, including presynaptic transmission, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and postsynaptic receptor activity, could underlie the neurological symptoms seen in Alpers' syndrome, such as seizures, developmental regression, and cognitive decline. This is especially evident with the observed downregulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission pathway, given the key role of GABAergic interneurons in epilepsy pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In contrast, the upregulation of astrocyte-and glial-related pathways, coupled with the evidence of increased astrocyte differentiation, suggests reactive astrogliosis in Alpers' syndrome. Furthermore, the upregulation of neuroinflammatory pathways may reflect an innate immune response to ongoing neuronal damage and loss, an aspect that warrants further exploration. Taken together, the insights derived from these 3D cortical organoids offer a promising avenue for exploring the complex pathophysiology of Alpers' syndrome, facilitating the development of potential therapeutic interventions. Moreover, the upregulation of neuroinflammatory pathways could represent a novel target for therapeutic strategies, given the increasing evidence for the involvement of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. In this study, the role of NAD + supplementation, specifically the administration of NR, was investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the pathological changes in Alpers' syndrome. NR supplementation has previously been shown to improve mitochondrial function <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, restore NAD + levels, and have a neuroprotective effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. These findings provided the rationale for investigating the potential benefits of NR supplementation in an Alpers' patient derived iPSC model, which revealed profound mitochondrial dysfunction. Upon administering NR to the patient derived cortical organoids, notable improvements were observed. Specifically, an increased expression of mature neuronal marker (MAP2) and cortical neural markers (SATB2 and CTIP2) was seen, indicating a recovery of neuronal populations in the NR-treated organoids. Additionally, a decrease in the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes, a marker for astrogliosis, was observed, further substantiating the neuroprotective effects of NR <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. These morphological changes corresponded with the recovery of mitochondrial function, as evidenced by the increased expression of the CI subunit NDUFB10 in NR-treated organoids. RNA-seq analysis offered further insights into the molecular underpinnings of NR's therapeutic effect. PCA analysis revealed that the entire RNA expression profile of the NR-treated Alpers' organoids shifted closer to that of the healthy controls, implying that NR treatment significantly altered gene expression. The GSEA pathway analysis corroborated these results, demonstrating upregulation of mitochondrial-related pathways and synaptic pathways, and downregulation of astrocyte/glial cell pathways and neuroinflammatory pathways in the NR-treated organoids. These findings lend credence to the potential therapeutic efficacy of NAD + supplementation in Alpers' syndrome.</p><p>In discussing the limitations of this study, it's worth emphasizing the challenges posed by the inherent rarity of Alpers' syndrome. Acquiring a large sample size of patient derived iPSC lines for our experiments was a significant hurdle due to the scarcity of patients, coupled with the complexities involved in reprogramming patient fibroblasts into iPSCs. Out of the two patient iPSC lines initially available to us, one demonstrated poor growth during its differentiation into brain organoids, likely an outcome of impaired mitochondrial function. This line failed to form embryoid bodies during the early stages of organoid differentiation and was unable to withstand the cryopreservation process. Conseq-uently, our experiments were conducted on two individual clones.</p><p>Furthermore, we understand the critique raised concerning the inclusion of additional patient lines or isogenic controls to bolster our conclusions. To this end, we attempted to use CRISPR on the patient's iPSCs to generate isogenic controls. Unfortunately, the patient's iPSCs exhibited suboptimal growth conducive to this procedure. As a solution, we decided to incorporate three different controls with multiple clones for each line, culminating in a total of five clones for the analysis. While this somewhat addressed the issue, it is nevertheless a limitation of our study, and results should be interpreted with this in mind.</p><p>Thus, although our study has yielded significant insights into the pathophysiological progression of Alpers' disease and potential therapeutic pathways, it is important to consider the constraints tied to the limited number of patient iPSC lines and the absence of isogenic controls. Future research may benefit from advancements in methodologies and techniques that allow for more efficient generation and growth of patient derived iPSCs, as well as more successful incorporation of isogenic controls. Despite these limitations, we believe our study offers a meaningful contribution to the understanding and potential treatment of Alpers' disease.</p><p>In conclusion, our research underscores the applicability of iPSC derived NSC and cortical organoid models as representative systems to simulate the pathophysiological progression of Alpers' disease. These platforms stand as robust tools for facilitating the discovery of therapeutic strategies for such debilitating conditions. Moreover, we provide evidence that NAD + supplementation, specifically through NR therapy, could present a promising clinical avenue for neuroprotection not only in Alpers' disease, but also in a broader spectrum of mitochondrial disorders.</p></div>
