Usage of the workflows
======================

In the following sections you will find some workflows with example commands that call the Python scripts and example outputs. These are examples for how the buidling blocks can be used to build the entire production pipeline. Some examples on how these building blocks can be strung together to a working pipeline are provided in the shell scripts.

.. warning::
    Since we are still working on the project, these shell scripts are work in progress! Also we may find that the original scripts on which the shell scripts are build need to be adopted with additional input parameters as the project progresses and requirements change. you might also need to refactor and change parts of this shell script to match your specific system set-up (memory, disk permission etc) or use case. Only use these scripts as templates. The shell scripts that we currently have are ::

        workflow_modelling.sh
        workflow_predict.sh
        workflow_pdf2text.sh
