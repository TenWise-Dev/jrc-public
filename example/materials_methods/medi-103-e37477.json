The potential active ingredients of R palmatum L with DL L 0.18 and OB \u2265 30 were selected for CRC. In addition, the other active ingredients with R palmatum L that were searched from articles in PubMed database were enrolled, including emodin, cis-resveratrol, physcion, chrysophanol. [17][18][19][20][21][22] The SMILES of potential active ingredients was obtained from Pubchem database (https://pubchem.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/).
