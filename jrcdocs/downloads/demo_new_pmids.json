        "abstract": "Psoriasis is an autoimmune chronic dermatosis that is T cell-mediated, characterized by epidermal thickening, aberrant epidermal differentiation and inflammatory infiltrates, with a dominant Th1 and Th17 profile. Additional in vitro models are required to study the complex interactions between activated T cells and skin cells, and to develop new, more effective treatments. We have therefore sought to model this psoriatic inflammation by the generation of tissue-engineered immunocompetent tissues, and we have investigated the response of activated T-cell infiltration in models produced with lesional psoriatic skin cells on major hallmarks of psoriasis. The immunocompetent lesional skin model displayed a delayed onset of epidermal differentiation, an hyperproliferation of the basal keratinocytes, a drastic increase in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and a disturbed expression of key transcription factors, as observed in lesional plaques, suggesting a crucial importance of combining the pathological phenotype of cutaneous cells to T cells in order to generate a relevant model for psoriasis. Finally, we found this skin model to be responsive to methotrexate treatment, making it a valuable tool for drug development."

The acantholysis associated with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune skin blistering disease, can be induced in HSOC by injecting a bi-specific anti-desmoglein (dsg) 1 and 3 single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv). Compared to cell culture experiments (e.g., induction of dsg3-internalization or keratinocyte dissociation using HaCaT cells or normal human epidermal keratinocytes) the HSOC model is more sophisticated and physiologically relevant. In this model, all three layers of the human skin are present, all cells are sustained in their physiological niche and orientation, and the cell-cell-contacts remain intact. Here we describe a protocol for HSOC, an ex vivo model of human skin, that has proved to be well-established and informative in our laboratory. (c) 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

In this work, we describe an efficient method free of enzymatic and Facs-sorted methods to culture human medullary thymic epithelial cells without affecting the cell phenotypic, physiologic and functional features. Human medulla thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are obtained by culturing thymic biopsies explants. After 7 days of primo-culture, mTECs keep their ability to express key molecules involved in immune tolerance processes such as autoimmune regulator, tissue-specific antigens, chemokines, and cytokines. In addition, the cells sensor their cultured environment and consequently adjust their gene expression network. Therefore, we describe and provide a human mTEC model that may be used to test the effect of various molecules on thymic epithelial cell homeostasis and physiology. This method should allow the investigations of the specificities and the knowledge of human mTECs in normal or pathological conditions and therefore discontinue the extrapolations done on the murine models."

We monitored the elevated monocyte adhesion to the TEBV wall and transendothelial migration (TEM) as the TEBV endothelium was activated by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. We demonstrated that treatment with anti-TNF-alpha or an NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitor would attenuate the endothelium activation and reduce the number of leukocyte adhesion (>74%) and TEM events (>87%) close to the control. As the first demonstration of real-time imaging of dynamic cellular events within a TEBV, this work paves the way for drug screening and disease modeling in TEBV-associated microphysiological systems."

Sinomenine is an alkaloid extracted from the stem of the Chinese medicinal plant Sinomenium acutum. It has been reported that sinomenine has immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of sinominine on IL-1beta-induced human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLS) is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of sinomenine on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in IL-1beta-treated human RAFLS in vitro and the underlying mechanism. RAFLS viability was evaluated using the MTS assay after sinomenine treatment. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured with ELISA, RT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The levels of TLR4 and its downstream signaling targets were determined by western blot analysis. We found that sinomenine suppressed not only NO and PGE2 production but also iNOS and COX-2 expression in IL-1beta-induced RAFLS. It also inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in IL-1beta-stimulated RAFLS. Furthermore, sinomenine prevented IL-1beta-induced TLR4, MyD88 and p-NF-kappaB p65 expression. Taken together, these results demonstrated that sinomenine prevented IL-1beta-induced inflammation in human RAFLS at least in part by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, suggesting that sinomenine could be a potential agent in the treatment of RA."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lesions of bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by the presence of tissue-bound and circulating autoantibodies to hemidesmosomal antigens, harbor a mixed inflammatory cellular infiltrate. In various models, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, monocytes as well as B and T cells have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of BP. However, their interactions with and effective role in blister formation remain uncertain. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of monocyte/neutrophil interaction on blister formation in an ex vivo BP model. METHODS: Skin cryosections were incubated with purified human neutrophils and monocytes, in the presence or absence of BP autoantibodies. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, mediator release (neutrophil elastase [NE], myeloperoxidase [MPO], matrix metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9]), binding of Fcgamma receptor (CD16, CD32, CD64), and cell adhesion (CD18, ICAM-1) was investigated using appropriate inhibitors. Dermal-epidermal separation (DES) was assessed by light microscopy and quantified by Fiji software. RESULTS: Monocytes and neutrophils synergistically interact resulting in a significantly higher DES compared to either monocytes or neutrophils separately (P < .0001). Monocyte/neutrophil-induced DES was associated with increased ROS production and was dependent on adhesion and FcgammaRIII binding. Upon stimulation by the granule-poor fraction of monocyte supernatants, neutrophils increased their release of MMP-9, thereby also DES at the dermal-epidermal junction of skin cryosections. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that the interaction of cells, as shown here for monocytes and neutrophils, enhances mediator release resulting in an increased subepidermal blister formation. Thus, blocking intercellular cross talk promises a new therapeutic approach for blocking tissue damage in BP."

Among the three main HF cycle stages-growth (anagen), regression (catagen) and relative quiescence (telogen)-only anagen HFs are attacked and thereby forced to prematurely enter into catagen, thus shortening active hair growth substantially. After having previously modelled the dynamics of immune system components critically involved in the disease development (Dobreva et al., 2015), we here present a mathematical model for AA which incorporates HF cycling and illustrates the anagen phase interruption in AA resulting from an inflammatory autoimmune response against HFs. The model couples a system describing the dynamics of autoreactive immune cells with equations modelling the hair cycle. We illustrate states of health, disease and treatment as well as transitions between them. In addition, we perform parameter sensitivity analysis to assess how different processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and input from stem cells, impact anagen duration in healthy versus AA-affected HFs. The proposed model may help in evaluating the effectiveness of existing treatments and identifying new potential therapeutic targets."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that ultraviolet B (UVB) inhibits DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) activity in CD4+ T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) is a type of Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs), and has been reported to play roles in the pathogenesis of different autoimmune diseases and can modulate DNMT1 activity. Moreover, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been reported to link UVB with SLE. However, the exact mechanisms by which DNMT1 activity is inhibited by UVB in lupus CD4+ T cells remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the exact mechanisms by which DNMT1 activity is inhibited by UVB in lupus CD4+ T cells. METHODS: Twenty-two newly diagnosed active SLE patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells were isolated, cultured and treated. DNMT1 activity assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, RNA interference using small interfering RNA and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were employed. RESULTS: DNMT1 activity was inhibited in si-SIRT1-transfected CD4+ T cells, and increased by the established SIRT1 activator, SRT1720. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression of SIRT1 were suppressed by UVB exposure in lupus CD4+ T cells. UVB-inhibited DNMT1 activity was reversed by SRT1720 in si-control-transfected lupus CD4+ T cells, but not in si-SIRT1-transfected lupus CD4 + T cells. Furthermore, AhR activation by VAF347 reduced the mRNA and protein expression of SIRT1. ChIP using an antibody against AhR in normal CD4+ T cells revealed a 16-fold stronger signal at the site about 1.6kb upstream from the translation start site of the SIRT1 promoter. Finally, UVB could activate AhR and inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of SIRT1. AhR knockdown abrogated the inhibition of UVB-mediated SIRT1 mRNA and protein expression and DNMT1 activity in lupus CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: UVB suppressed SIRT1 expression via activating AhR, and subsequently inhibited DNMT1 activity in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients."

        "abstract": "SCOPE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multiorgan autoimmune disease characterized by immune deregulation, which involves altered T-cell response and imbalance of cytokine production. The phenolic fraction (PE) of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties and exerts preventive effects in murine models of immune-inflammatory diseases, such as SLE. The present study was designed to determine the in vitro effects of the PE from EVOO on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from inactive patients with SLE and healthy donors. METHODS AND RESULTS: T-cell phenotype was investigated by flow cytometry, cytokine levels were determined by ELISA, and protein expression was detected by Western blot. The PE of EVOO decreased the frequency of CD69(+) cells and the secretion of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-10. Moreover, PE increased the expression of I-kappa-B-alpha and decreased extracellular signal regulated kinase phosphorylation on PBMC from patients with SLE and healthy donors. CONCLUSION: PE modulates cytokine production and attenuates induced T-cell activation, probably through NF-kappaB signaling pathway, providing the first evidence that PE from EVOO has an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role in SLE patients and it might therefore be considered as a dietary complement in SLE management."

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3, and the downstream proteins suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, have been implicated in psoriasis disease progression. Calcipotriol, a synthetic derivative of vitamin D, has been used clinically to treat psoriasis, but the mechanism of action that underlies the beneficial effects of calcipotriol is still being explored. The objective of this study was to determine whether STAT1 and STAT3 signaling is involved in calcipotriol treatment. Using an in vitro immortal human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, as a psoriasis model, we examined the molecular signaling induced by calcipotriol treatment. We found that calcipotriol treatment or silencing of either STAT1 or STAT3 inhibited proliferation of HaCaT cells. Calcipotriol downregulated the expression of STAT1 and STAT3 at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were also decreased, suggesting calcipotriol treatment inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Calcipotriol-mediated STAT inhibition was further substantiated by the downregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 at the mRNA and protein expression levels. Taken together, our results suggest a novel molecular mechanism for calcipotriol-mediated treatment effects in psoriasis."

PF sera contain polyclonal Abs which are heterogeneous mixture of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Abs, as shown by isolation of monoclonal Abs (mAbs). OBJECTIVE: To investigate how pathogenic and non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 Abs contribute to blister formation in PF. METHODS: Using organ-cultured human skin, we compared the effect of a single pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG mAb, a single non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG mAb, and their mixture on blister formation as analyzed by histology, subcellular localization of IgG deposits and desmosomal proteins by confocal microscopy, and desmosomal structure by electron microscopy. In addition, we measured keratinocyte adhesion by an in vitro dissociation assay. RESULTS: 24h after injection, a single pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG caused a subcorneal blister with IgG and Dsg1 localized linearly on the cell surface of keratinocytes. A single non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG bound linearly on the keratinocytes but did not induce blisters. A pathogenic and a non-pathogenic IgG mAb injected together caused an aberrant granular pattern of IgG and Dsg1 in the lower epidermis with blister formation in the superficial epidermis. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the mixture of mAbs shortened desmosomal lengths more than a single mAb in the basal and spinous layers. Furthermore, although Dsg1 clustering required both cross-linking of Dsg1 molecules by the non-pathogenic IgG plus a pathogenic antibody, the latter could be in the form of a monovalent single chain variable fragment, suggesting that loss of trans-interaction of Dsg1 is required for clustering. Finally, a p38MAPK inhibitor blocked Dsg1 clustering. When pathogenic strength was measured by the dissociation assay, a mixture of pathogenic and non-pathogenic IgG mAbs disrupted keratinocyte adhesion more than a single pathogenic mAb. This pathogenic effect was only partially suppressed by the p38MAPK inhibitor. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a polyclonal mixture of anti-Dsg1 IgG antibodies enhances pathogenic activity for blister formation associated with p38MAPK-dependent Dsg1 clustering and that not only pathogenic antibodies but also non-pathogenic antibodies coordinately contribute to blister formation in PF."

Due to the lack of a specific test for BD, its diagnosis is very difficult and therapeutic options are limited. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, which provides inaccessible disease-relevant cell types, opens a new era for disease treatment. In this study, we generated BD iPSCs from patient somatic cells and differentiated them into hematopoietic precursor cells (BD iPSC-HPCs) as BD model cells. Based on comparative transcriptome analysis using our BD model cells, we identified eight novel BD-specific genes, AGTR2, CA9, CD44, CXCL1, HTN3, IL-2, PTGER4, and TSLP, which were differentially expressed in BD patients compared with healthy controls or patients with other immune diseases. The use of CXCL1 as a BD biomarker was further validated at the protein level using both a BD iPSC-HPC-based assay system and BD patient serum samples. Furthermore, we show that our BD iPSC-HPC-based drug screening system is highly effective for testing CXCL1 BD biomarkers, as determined by monitoring the efficacy of existing anti-inflammatory drugs. Our results shed new light on the usefulness of patient-specific iPSC technology in the development of a benchmarking platform for disease-specific biomarkers, phenotype- or target-driven drug discovery, and patient-tailored therapies."

Indeed, TG2 deamidates specific gliadin peptides, thus enhancing their immunogenicity. Moreover, the transamidating activity seems to provoke an autoimmune response, where TG2 is the main autoantigen. Many studies have highlighted a possible pathogenetic role of anti-TG2 antibodies, because they modulate TG2 enzymatic activity and they can interact with cell-surface TG2, triggering a wide range of intracellular responses. Autoantibodies also alter the uptake of the alpha-gliadin peptide 31-43 (p31-43), responsible of the innate immune response in CD, thus partially protecting cells from p31-43 damaging effects in an intestinal cell line. Here, we investigated whether anti-TG2 antibodies protect cells from p31-43-induced damage in a CD model consisting of primary dermal fibroblasts. We found that the antibodies specifically reduced the uptake of p31-43 by fibroblasts derived from healthy subjects but not in those derived from CD patients. Analyses of TG2 expression and enzymatic activity did not reveal any significant difference between fibroblasts from healthy and celiac subjects, suggesting that other features related to TG2 may be responsible of such different behaviors, e.g., trafficking or subcellular distribution. Our findings are in line with the concept that a \"celiac cellular phenotype\" exists and that TG2 may contribute to this phenotype. Moreover, they suggest that the autoimmune response to TG2, which alone may damage the celiac mucosa, also fails in its protective role in celiac cells."

B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is a key factor in survival and maturation of B cells and is overexpressed in several autoimmune patients although the mechanism behind this feature is unclear. In murine models, BAFF expression could be upregulated by exogenous estrogen treatment in splenocytes; however, no evidence of this relationship was available in humans. Here, leukocytes from healthy male and female individuals were collected and cultivated in the presence or absence of estrogen or progesterone. BAFF gene expression was accessed by quantitative PCR and compared between treated and untreated group of cells. In the presence of estrogen, BAFF expression was upregulated by more than 5 times in both genders. When exposed to progesterone, the female-originated cells showed increased expression, while the cells of male origin a significant downregulation of BAFF. Our results suggest that female hormones can modulate the expression of BAFF, a key cytokine in autoimmune pathways, in human immune cells. These data might contribute to the understanding of the etiology as well as the gender bias featured by several autoimmune disorders."

        "abstract": "A pressing need exists for autoimmune disease therapies that act in an antigen-specific manner while avoiding global immunosuppression. Multivalent soluble antigen arrays (SAgAPLP:LABL), designed to induce tolerance to a specific multiple sclerosis autoantigen, consist of a flexible hyaluronic acid (HA) polymer backbone cografted with multiple copies of autoantigen peptide (PLP) and cell adhesion inhibitor peptide (LABL). Previous in vivo studies revealed copresentation of both signals on HA was necessary for therapeutic efficacy. To elucidate therapeutic cellular mechanisms, in vitro studies were performed in a model B cell system to evaluate binding and specificity. Compared to HA and HA arrays containing only grafted PLP or LABL, SAgAPLP:LABL displaying both PLP and LABL exhibited greatly enhanced B cell binding. Furthermore, the binding avidity of SAgAPLP:LABL was primarily driven by the PLP antigen, determined via flow cytometry competitive dissociation studies. Fluorescence microscopy showed SAgAPLP:LABL induced mature receptor clustering that was faster than other HA arrays with only one type of grafted peptide. SAgAPLP:LABL molecules also reduced and inhibited IgM-stimulated signaling as discerned by a calcium flux assay. The molecular mechanisms of enhanced antigen-specific binding, mature receptor clustering, and dampened signaling observed in B cells may contribute to SAgAPLP:LABL therapeutic efficacy."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by microvascular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. It has become increasingly evident that platelets, beyond regulating hemostasis, are important in inflammation and innate immunity. Platelets may be an important source of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines in the vascular microenvironment. In this study, we sought to assess the contribution of platelet-derived factors in patients with SSc to the angiogenesis of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVECs) in a tubule formation assay and to characterize the secretion of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines in these platelets. METHODS: We analyzed platelets obtained from 30 patients with SSc and 12 healthy control subjects. Angiogenesis was evaluated in vitro with a DMVEC tubule formation assay on Matrigel and platelet-derived angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 165b isoform (VEGF165b), and cytokine secretion was evaluated. Platelet serotonin content was also determined. RESULTS: When DMVECs were incubated with SSc platelet releasates, tubule formation was significantly inhibited (p < 0.01, t test), and higher expression of endothelin-1 in these cells was observed compared with control subjects (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). In SSc platelet releasates, VEGF165b was significantly higher (p < 0.05, t test), and the VEGF165b/VEGF ratio was increased compared with that of control subjects. Higher secretion of transforming growth factor beta (p < 0.01, t test) and CD40L (p < 0.01, t test) was observed compared with control subjects. Also, intraplatelet serotonin levels were lower in platelets obtained from patients with diffuse SSc compared with patients with limited SSc and control subjects (p < 0.05, t test). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that antiangiogenic factors such as VEGF165b, together with proinflammatory and profibrotic factors secreted by platelets, can contribute to the progression of peripheral microvascular damage, defective vascular repair, and fibrosis in patients with SSc."

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that results from the destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, leading to abolition of insulin secretion and onset of diabetes. Cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, activated by antigen presenting cells (APCs), are both implicated in disease onset and progression. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), on the other hand, play a leading role in regulating immunological tolerance and resistant homoeostasis in T1D by suppressing effector T cells (Teffs). Recent data indicates that after activation, conventional Teffs transiently produce interleukin IL-2, a cytokine that acts as a growth factor for both Teffs and Tregs. Tregs suppress Teffs through IL-2 deprivation, competition and Teff conversion into inducible Tregs (iTregs). To investigate the interactions of these components during T1D progression, a mathematical model of T-cell dynamics is developed as a predictor of beta-cell loss, with the underlying hypothesis that avidity of Teffs and Tregs, i.e., the binding affinity of T-cell receptors to peptide-major histocompatibility complexes on host cells, is continuum. The model is used to infer a set of criteria that determines susceptibility to T1D in high risk subjects. Our findings show that diabetes onset is guided by the absence of Treg-to-Teff dominance at specific high avidities, rather than over the whole range of avidity, and that the lack of overall dominance of Teffs-to-Tregs over time is the underlying cause of the \"honeymoon period\", the remission phase observed in some T1D patients. The model also suggests that competition between Teffs and Tregs is more effective than Teff-induction into iTregs in suppressing Teffs, and that a prolonged full width at half maximum of IL-2 release is a necessary condition for curbing disease onset. Finally, the model provides a rationale for observing rapid and slow progressors of T1D based on modest heterogeneity in the kinetic parameters."

The role of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) in cytokine-induced human B cell differentiation and class-switch recombination remains incompletely defined. This study analysed the effect of Btk on human activated B cells. METHODS: Purified B cells from healthy subjects were stimulated with B cell receptor (BCR) and other stimuli with or without a Btk inhibitor and gene expression was measured. The B cell line BJAB was used to assess Btk-associated signalling cascades. Phosphorylated Btk (p-Btk) in peripheral blood B cells obtained from 10 healthy subjects and 41 patients with RA was measured by flow cytometry and compared with patient backgrounds. RESULTS: IL-21 signalling, in concert with BCR, CD40 and BAFF signals, led to robust expression of differentiation- and class-switch DNA recombination-related genes and IgG production in human B cells, all of which were significantly suppressed by the Btk inhibitor. Although phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was induced by co-stimulation with IL-21, BCR and CD40, STAT1 phosphorylation in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm, was exclusively impaired by Btk blockade. High levels of p-Btk were noted in B cells of RA patients compared with controls and they correlated significantly with titres of RF among RF-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The findings elucidate a model in which Btk not only plays a fundamental role in the regulation of BCR signalling, but may also mediate crosstalk with cytokine signalling pathways through regulation of IL-21-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in the nuclei of human B cells. Btk appears to have pathological relevance in RA."

Although topical vitamin D analogues are widely used for treatment of psoriasis and vitamin D has been increasingly implicated in prevention and protection from several autoimmune diseases, experimental and clinical data in autoimmune bullous diseases are generally lacking. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated the effects of calcitriol on keratinocytes treated by bullous pemphigoid (BP) autoantibodies. METHODS: Human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells were treated with purified human BP or normal IgG from one BP patient and healthy subject, respectively, in the absence or presence of calcitriol and effects on (i) cell viability, (ii) IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, (iii) STAT3 and NFkappaB activation, (iv) heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) level, and (v) vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression were studied. RESULTS: We found that BP IgG-induced IL-6 and IL-8 release from HaCaT cells was reduced in the presence of non-toxic doses of calcitriol. Additionally, calcitriol blunted BP IgG-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and NFkappaB activity, whereas Hsp70 and VDR expression were not affected. CONCLUSION: Although the results of this study are based on autoantibodies prepared from a single patient, they show that calcitriol protects from BP IgG-induced inflammatory processes in vitro, thus favouring its potential inclusion into the therapeutic repertoire of BP."

We have undertaken novel strategies at the interface of engineering and clinical medicine to integrate nanoscale visual and structural data using nanorobotic atomic force microscopy with cell functional analyses to reveal previously unattainable details of autoimmune processes in real-time. Pemphigus vulgaris is a life-threatening autoimmune blistering skin condition in which there is disruption of desmosomal cell-cell adhesion structures that are associated with the presence of antibodies directed against specific epithelial proteins including Desmoglein (Dsg) 3. We demonstrate that pathogenic (blister-forming) anti-Dsg3 antibodies, distinct from non-pathogenic (non-blister forming) anti-Dsg3 antibodies, alter the structural and functional properties of keratinocytes in two sequential steps--an initial loss of cell adhesion and a later induction of apoptosis-related signaling pathways, but not full apoptotic cell death. We propose a \"2-Hit\" model for autoimmune disruption associated with skin-specific pathogenic autoantibodies. These data provide unprecedented details of autoimmune processes at the tissue level and offer a novel conceptual framework for understanding the action of self-reactive antibodies."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system, involved in both initiating immune responses and maintaining tolerance. Dysfunctional and via toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands activated DC have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, but their role in the etiology of Sjogren's syndrome, a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by progressive mononuclear cell infiltration in the exocrine glands, has not been revealed yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate phenotype and functional properties of immature and TLR7/8 stimulated monocyte-derived DC (moDC) of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and compare them to healthy controls. METHODS: The phenotype, apoptosis susceptibility and endocytic capacity of moDC were analyzed by flow cytometry. Secretion of cytokines was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex Luminex analyses in moDC cell culture supernatants. The expression of TLR7 was analyzed by flow cytometry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Expression of Ro/Sjogren's syndrome-associated autoantigen A (Ro52/SSA), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF-8), Bim, signal transduction and activators of transcription (Stat) 1, p-Stat1 (Tyrosin 701), p-Stat1 (Serin 727), Stat3, pStat3 (Tyrosin 705) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphatase dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was measured by Western blotting. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) family members were quantified using the ELISA-based TransAM NF-kappaB family kit. RESULTS: We could not detect differences in expression of co-stimulatory molecules and maturation markers such as cluster of differentiation (CD) 86, CD80, CD40 or CD83 on moDC from patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we could not observe variations in apoptosis susceptibility, Bim and Ro52/SSA expression and the endocytic capacity of the moDC. However, we found that moDC from pSS patients expressed increased levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. We also found significant differences in cytokine production by moDC, where increased interleukin (IL)-12p40 secretion in mature pSS moDC correlated with increased RelB expression. Strikingly, moDC from pSS patients matured for 48 hours with TLR7/8 ligand CL097 expressed significantly less Stat1. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a role for moDC in the pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome."

In epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), an autoimmune disease with severe and chronic skin blistering, autoantibodies are directed against type VII collagen. IgG is the predominant autoantibody isotype of EBA, the pathogenicity of which has been demonstrated in a variety of in vivo and ex vivo disease models. In contrast, there is not much evidence for the pathogenicity of IgA, which may appear as the only autoantibody isotype in some EBA patients. To investigate the pathogenic potential of IgA autoantibodies, we generated chimeric V gene-matched human IgA1, IgA2, and control IgG1 autoantibodies directed against type VII collagen. Immobilized immune complexes containing the rIgA1 and rIgA2 autoantibodies induced the dose-dependent release of reactive oxygen species from neutrophil granulocytes, a precondition for blister formation. Moreover, both rIgA1 and rIgA2 induced leukocyte-dependent dermal-epidermal separation in cryosections of human skin. In contrast with rIgG1, neither rIgA1 nor rIgA2 was capable of inducing complement deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction. Because complement activation is a prerequisite for blister induction, this lack of function compared with IgG1 may be compensated for by the stronger activation of neutrophil granulocytes by both IgA1 and IgA2. For IgG-mediated AIBD, immunoadsorption therapy is a convenient treatment modality for the removal of pathogenic autoantibodies, particularly in treatment-resistant cases. The results of this study show the pathogenic potential of IgA autoantibodies and support the development of adsorber matrices for IgA-mediated AIBD."

As the multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been regarded as an autoimmune disease of CNS mediated by T cells, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of DA on in vitro functional status of T cells from relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients. Peripheral T-cells from RR-MS patients were activated by mitogens and cell proliferation and cytokine production were assayed by [(3)H]-thymidine uptake and ELISA, respectively. Our results demonstrated that DA enhanced in vitro T cell proliferation and Th17-related cytokines in MS-derived cell cultures. In addition, this catecholamine reduced Treg-related cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-beta) release by activated CD4(+) T cells. These DA-induced effects on T cells were mainly dependent on IL-6 production by both polyclonally-activated CD4(+) T cells and LPS-stimulated monocytes. Furthermore, the production of IL-17 and IL-6 by MS-derived T cells was directly related with neurological disability (EDSS score), and the release of these cytokines was less sensitive to glucocorticoid inhibition in MS patients than in control group, mainly after DA addition. In conclusion, our data suggest that DA amplifies glucocorticoid-resistant Th17 phenotype in MS patients, and this phenomenon could be, at least in part, due to its ability to induce IL-6 production by monocytes and CD4(+) T cells."

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are central components of the aggressive, tumour-like synovial structure termed pannus, which invades the joint space and cartilage. A distinct natural killer (NK) cell subset expressing the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A receptor is present in RA synovial fluid. Little is known about possible cellular interactions between RA-FLS and NK cells. We used cultured RA-FLS and the human NK cell line Nishi, of which the latter expresses an NK receptor repertoire similar to that of NK cells in RA synovial fluid, as an in vitro model system of RA-FLS/NK cell cross-talk. We show that RA-FLS express numerous ligands for both activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, and stimulate degranulation of Nishi cells. We found that NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp46 and NKp44 are the key activating receptors involved in Nishi cell degranulation towards RA-FLS. Moreover, blockade of the interaction between CD94/NKG2A and its ligand HLA-E expressed on RA-FLS further enhanced Nishi cell degranulation in co-culture with RA-FLS. Using cultured RA-FLS and the human NK cell line Nishi as an in vitro model system of RA-FLS/NK cell cross-talk, our results suggest that cell-mediated cytotoxicity of RA-FLS may be one mechanism by which NK cells influence local joint inflammation in RA."

Thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels are controlled by negative-feedback control through thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). T4, like other hormones, can be bound or unbound; the unbound T4 (FT4) is used as a marker for hypothyroidism. Autoimmune thyroiditis is a disease in which the thyroid-infiltrating lymphocytes attack autoantigens in follicle cells, destroying them over a long time. To describe the operation of the feedback control, we developed a mathematical model involving four clinical variables: TSH, FT4, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and the thyroid gland's functional size. The first three variables are regularly measured while the last variable is determined through relationships between the other three variables. The problem of two different time scales for circulating hormones and thyroid damage is addressed using singular perturbation theory. Analysis of the mathematical model establishes stability and conditions under which the diseased state can maintain the slow movement toward diseased state equilibrium. Although we have used four variables in modelling the feedback control through the HPT axis, the predicted clinical course given any set of parameters is shown to depend on the steady-state levels of TSH and FT4. This observation makes possible the development of the clinical charts based only on the levels of TSH, time and potential steady-state values. To validate the model predictions, a dataset obtained from a Sicilian adult population has been employed."
