Introduction
------------

This documentation describes the programming framework that is used for the JRC project on NAMs. In short, this projects aims at building a database of articles and their abstracts that describe New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) for the investigation of a number of research areas. Based on this database, mathematical models can be build that learn to recognize NAM abstracts papers from a wide variety of articles/abstracts.


The documentation contains a number of document types 

 - **Background documents** with details in some modelling techniques or the specific of special libraries that we are using. These documents are not essential for working with the framework but enhance the understanding of the workings of the framework.
 - **Workflow documents** that describe workflows to accomplish specific tasks, such as installation of software and modules, creating and updating databases, and running predictive models.
 - **Documented scripts** that describe the actual scripts that are being used in the workflows. Most of these scripts will be Python scripts, but some shell, bash and R scripts will also be used.
 - **Downloadable data files** that can be used to run the scripts in this framework.

Overview documents that describe the overall goal of the workpackages in this project and the results of the individual tasks in the workpackages can be downloaded from a separate location (here).
