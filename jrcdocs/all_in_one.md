# Purpose and Overview

We will state the purpose and high-level functionality of the code or
workflow and explain how this workflow can be used to retrieve documents, parse information
and store as a non-redundant consolidated data set. We will also outline how to update the
data when new documents become available. We will further provide a (graphical) overview
of the main components or steps involved and the overall structure and organisation of the
codebase, including a description of the main modules, classes, or files and their
relationships.

# Usage Instructions

We will describe how to use the code or workflow correctly and include
information on input requirements, expected output, and any necessary configuration or setup
steps. These will be illustrated with examples and/or code snippets to illustrate proper usage.

# Technical Documentation

In the scripts we will explain the expected behaviour of the script
and its associated functions. This means the expected input and the provided return values,
and potential exceptions or errors. Function level code examples will be provided. For the
general usage of external libraries, we will refer to the respective manuals of those libraries,
rather than copying the external content into our own documentation.

# Data Structures

We will explain the main underlying data structures and also provide
example datafiles and graphical illustration.

# Dependencies and External Resources

We will indicate any dependencies or external (Python or GNU) libraries that the code relies on. In addition, the dependency on external data sources and their associated APIs like MEDLINE or PMC will be highlighted.

# Configuration and Environment Setup

We will explain how to set up the required system and environment configurations and provide default values if applicable.

# FAQ

We will list the common errors and pitfalls that may
occur during usage of the scripts and provide troubleshooting tips or debugging techniques
and provide best practices for error handling.

# Request for features

Version Control and Collaboration: We will use git for version control systems and provide
guidelines for submitting bug reports or proposing enhancements.

# Version 

We will keep a record of significant changes, bug fixes, and
new features introduced in different versions of the code. These will be summarised in release
notes, highlighting potential impact on their existing implementations.
