<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The biological barriers existing in the human body separate the blood circulation from the interstitial fluid in tissues. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) isolates the central nervous system from the bloodstream, presenting a dual role: the protection of the human brain against potentially toxic/harmful substances coming from the blood, while providing nutrients to the brain and removing metabolites. In terms of architectural features, the presence of junctional proteins (that restrict the paracellular transport) and the existence of efflux transporters at the BBB are the two major in vivo characteristics that increase the difficulty in creating an ideal in vitro model for drug permeability studies and neurotoxicity assessments. The purpose of this work is to provide an up-to-date literature review on the current in vitro models used for BBB studies, focusing on the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of both primary cultures and immortalized cell lines. An accurate analysis of the more recent and emerging techniques implemented to optimize the in vitro models is also provided, based on the need of recreating as closely as possible the BBB microenvironment. In fact, the acceptance that the BBB phenotype is much more than endothelial cells in a monolayer has led to the shift from single-cell to multicellular models. Thus, in vitro co-culture models have narrowed the gap between recreating as faithfully as possible the human BBB phenotype. This is relevant for permeability and neurotoxicity assays, and for studies related to neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies with these purposes will be also presented and discussed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Blood-Brain Barrier: Development and Characterization</head><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a selective and highly specialized structure primarily formed by a tight monolayer of endothelial cells of cerebral capillaries and microvessels. The BBB controls the movement between the bloodstream and the brain interstitial space, protecting the central nervous system (CNS) against pathogens and potentially harmful substances <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Its defense role is due to: (i) the tight paracellular barrier, achieved by the inter-endothelial junctions; (ii) the low levels of transcellular transport; (iii) the high presence of efflux pumps in endothelial cells, and (iv) the presence of metabolic enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase, cytochrome P450-related enzymes (CYP450), among others). Regardless of its well-established barrier function, the BBB also allows the inflow of ions, nutrients, and oxygen necessary for the normal neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>The CNS (brain and spinal cord) is highly vascularized to cover the metabolic demands of this active tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In the embryonic phase, brain formation starts with vascularization, which occurs over two different processes: vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis consists of the differentiation of mesoderm-derived angioblasts (progenitors of endothelial cells) into blood vessels. This process takes place in the initial stages of the embryonic phase with the formation of the perineural vascular plexus (vascular complex surrounding the neural tube) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Angiogenesis is a process described as the formation of new vessels from pre-existing ones, taking place in later stages of the embryonic development and adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In the embryonic stage, after the formation of the perineural vascular plexus, the angiogenesis process sets in, overlapping with the BBB formation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Being a multistep process, it starts when highly invasive endothelial progenitor cells sprout from the perineural vascular plexus and migrate towards the neuroepithelium of the neural tube <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The angiogenesis process is driven by several factors released by the endothelial cells, epithelium, and neural progenitor cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors, placenta growth factors (PIGF), interleukins, G-proteincoupled receptor (GPR124), and angiopoietin-1, involving the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>After angiogenesis, the barrier maturation continues with the appearance of tight junction proteins, nutrient transporter expression, the increased expression of efflux transporters, decreased levels of transcytosis, and decreased permeability to water-soluble compounds, such as mannitol, potassium, and urea <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>The newly formed vessels recruit pericytes, responsible for the stabilization of the new structure membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Pericytes recruitment is mainly due to the secreted plateletderived growth factor B (PDGF-B) produced by endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>At the same time, neural progenitor cells originating from the neuroepithelium, using radial glia cells as a guidance structure, migrate towards the cerebral cortex (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). During this process, they differentiate into neuroblast and neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. Astrocytes developing from radial glia, like pericytes, limit BBB permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The development of the BBB phenotype is not inherent to brain endothelial cells. Barrier properties mature when endothelial cells come in close contact with pericytes and astrocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. Pericytes and astrocytes are two cellular components identified as surrounding elements of the endothelial cells, important not only for embryonic development, but also for the maintenance of the BBB characteristics in adult life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Previous studies support the importance of pericytes in the BBB formation, as their absence leads to endothelial hyperplasia and increased BBB permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Historically, the BBB was first defined as a tight monolayer of endothelial cells that form the walls of vessels/capillaries. Currently the concept of a neurovascular unit is embraced when the BBB is characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</p><p>The BBB is an endothelial structure organized in a set of components responsible for maintaining the BBB microenvironment adjusted for its normal functions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Its typical phenotype and plasticity are obtained by the presence of the neurovascular unit that combines a cellular and molecular complex formed by neurons, astrocytes end-feet, microglia, pericytes, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, individually explored in the following sections.</p></div>

However, the isolation of primary cells is a timeconsuming process, and it is more likely to suffer from contamination with non-endothelial cells. Especially animal models demonstrate major disadvantages, namely in the expression of influx and efflux transporters, when compared to the in vivo characteristics of the human BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. To avoid interspecies variability, primary cells of human origin could be utilized, but their use is limited by ethical issues. Alternatively, immortalized human brain capillary endothelial cells can be used. Despite their main limitation (low TEER values), which has driven several studies aiming their optimization, their use is beneficial because they proliferate indefinitely while eliminating the interspecies variability problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>The cells from human and non-human origin used to create in vitro models of the BBB, studied so far, are explored in the next two chapters. For each cell model, we show a description of their general characteristics, including their limitations and the BBB markers they express. The BBMECs are a well-established model of the BBB. The cells are isolated from bovine cerebral cortex, by enzymatic digestion, and purified by centrifugation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. They show a spindle-like morphology, forming monolayers with tight junctions, and expressing many transporters and enzymes typical of the BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. Giving the ability to retain many morphological and biochemical properties of the BBB (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>), BBMECs have been used in studies of uptake, transport, and metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Like the previous cells, PBMECs are isolated from the grey matter tissue of porcine brain, by enzymatic digestion, and purified by centrifugation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Microscopic examinations demonstrate that the morphology of the cells is consistent with endothelial microvasculature since they adopt a spindle-like, squamous shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This model has shown high TEER values with a good expression of tight junction proteins, transporters, receptors, and enzymes. Noteworthy, and most importantly, this model has been extensively used since: (i) the isolation of the brain endothelial cells gives a high yield of cells, when compared to that from rat or mouse, therefore less animal sacrifice; (ii) lower interspecies variability (the porcine genome, anatomy and physiopathology reflect the human biology more closely than many laboratory animals. Even disease progression resembles humans, making pigs one of the most suitable animal model to study human disease); (iii) as a by-product of the meat industry, the porcine brain is relatively easy to obtain and unexpensive; (iv) their usage is more ethically acceptable for research; (v) compared to other animals, especially rodent and bovine, BBB models from porcine usually retain many key features of the BBB after isolation and present slower rate of phenotype loss of the BBB in culture; therefore, coculture with, for example, astrocytes is not essential to induce high TEER values <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Future Perspectives: Microfluidic and Stem Cells</head><p>In vitro BBB models have been developed over the years using cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) obtained mainly from non-human sources. Based on several studies that have highlighted differences in the properties of BBB models obtained from different species, especially with regard to the brain pharmacokinetics, claudins, and the expression of ABC/SLC transporters, it has become more evident that the most reasonable solution would be to create a human-based model, what might allow for more accurate studies of BBB function <ref type="bibr">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>.</p><p>In vitro BBB models from human primary BMECs have drawbacks that include limited cell availability and loss of phenotype during cell culture (from batch to batch). The use of immortalized human cells has been established by the transduction of tumor genes to try to address the limitations of the primary sources, as already explored. However, those cell lines have also failed as ideal models, particularly showing general lower barrier functions when compared to primary cells <ref type="bibr">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>. Nonetheless, BBB development, maintenance and disease states are difficult and time-consuming to study in vivo. In vivo studies are limited to non-invasive methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, causing researchers to constantly try to find other in vitro models as an alternative for simpler analyses. Additionally, the BBB endothelium is very difficult to harvest from embryonic animal or human brain, greatly limiting the study of the BBB development <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Recently, new advances in the field of stem cells have opened pathways for the development of human BBB models that circumvent these limitations. Stem cells are a very promising cell source for the development of in vitro models, given their ability to expand by self-renewal and to differentiate into more specialized cells, particularly into brain endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>.</p><p>Human stem cells, such as pluripotent or multipotent cells (like hematopoietic progenitor, neural progenitor cells), can be isolated during development and from adult tissues, and their inherent properties are consequently dependent on the stage and site from which they are isolated. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_27">26</ref> systematizes the different types of stem cells and their main characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">92]</ref>.</p><p>Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) present a unique opportunity for generating HBMECs forming the BBB, as they show limitless proliferation and are able to differentiate into nearly any cell type <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Furthermore, iPSCs can also be used to investigate the phenotype of several genetic diseases. This is achieved by isolating cells from a patient with the genetic disease under study, establishing an iPSC line, and differentiating that line into the cell type(s) affected by the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, although iPSCs are wellsuited for generating substantial quantities of brain-like endothelial cells and for studying BBB development and disease in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">92]</ref>, regrettably, the time, cost, and specialized knowledge needed to differentiate iPSCs into purified BMECs obviates their widespread application <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Some of the main characteristics of iPSCs are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_27">26</ref>.</p><p>To overcome some of the limitations of using iPSCs, namely the time needed for cell differentiation, Hollman and colleagues, in 2017, proposed an accelerated differentiation of human iPSCs to BBB endothelial cells, by using a defined medium, termed E6 [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 containing ascorbic acid, sodium bicarbonate, selenium, human transferrin, and human insulin)]. This expedites the differentiation of iPSCs into BMECs, while achieving a performance comparable to the BMECs generated using well-established methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Outstandingly, by employing E6 medium in conjunction with updated culture techniques, the differentiation period of iPSCs into BMECs was successfully shortened from thirteen to eight days. By immunocytochemistry, it was confirmed that, similarly to unconditioned medium (UM)-derived BMECs, E6-derived BMECs presented a robust expression of several endothelial markers and their signature tight junction proteins (BBB markers), including claudin-5, occludin, GLUT-1, PECAM-1, and VE-cadherin, demonstrating the acquisition of a BBB phenotype. Furthermore, E6-derived BMECs consistently demonstrated TEER values exceeding 2500 Ω × cm 2 across multiple iPSC lines (with the highest recorded TEER value of 4678 ± 49 Ω × cm 2 ). Moreover, the passive barrier properties observed by the obtained TEER values were further confirmed by the paracellular permeability of fluorescein, which was smaller than 1.95 × 10 -7 cm/s for all lines. The activity of efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein and MRP family members, was also evaluated and no significant differences were detected between E6-derived BMECs and UM-derived BMECs, highlighting that the modification of the differentiation medium did not impact the activity of efflux transporters expressed on BMECs. These findings clearly suggest that the use of E6 medium for the differentiation of iPSCs into BMECs, along with updated seeding techniques, shortens the differentiation period and produces BMECs with comparable functionality to conventional UM-based differentiation protocols. Furthermore, knowing that iPSCs-derived BMECs can acquire an increased barrier phenotype when co-cultured with astrocytes and pericytes, a co-culture model was then developed by co-culturing iPSCs-derived BMECs with iPSC-derived astrocytes and primary human brain pericytes. The impact of co-culturing iPSC-derived BMECs with astrocytes and pericytes was evaluated by the measurement of TEER values. BMECs differentiated using the E6 medium were responsive to the inductive signals from astrocytes and pericytes, achieving a maximum TEER value of 6635 ± 315 Ω × cm 2 . Overall, and given that the robustness and reliability of the developed differentiation protocol was clearly validated across distinct iPSC lines, obtaining BMECs through an accelerated differentiation protocol, with comparable performance and with reduced production costs, this method could be successfully applied in the development of more accessible iPSC-derived in vitro BBB models for a diverse range of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Several other studies reporting the use of iPSC-derived BMECs co-cultured with other cells of the neurovascular unit, such as neurons, astrocytes, pericytes and microglia, will be explored in the following sections. Current co-culture models of the BBB are developed mainly using the Transwell culture systems, one of the most used platforms to study barrier formation, cell migration, and drug delivery <ref type="bibr">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>. The Transwell cell culture inserts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>) are sterilized, convenient, easy-to-use permeable supports, designed to recreate a cellular environment as close as possible to the in vivo state. However, they fail to reinvent aspects related to the threedimensional (3D) structure of the BBB, as well as the influence of blood flow <ref type="bibr">[92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. The use of microfluidic devices has grown in the last decade, and they basically consist of small devices made of small chambers and micro-scale fluidic circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. Microfluidic allows the mimicry of the in vivo 3D architecture, creating a more realistic microenvironment, while requiring less cell number and reducing the reagents needed; allows to take in consideration the effect of shear stress (which allows the differentiation of the endothelium into a BBB phenotype); enables the real-time monitoring of permeability, cell extravasation, and the dynamics of TEER measures; and facilitates the use of cellular diversity to obtain a more trustworthy human BBB model.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Advantages and Limitations</head><p>Low TEER values and low expression of important efflux transporters are the two limitations most often pointed out to the monoculture models developed over the years to study the BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. One of the emerging concerns of the researchers was related with the improvement of the monoculture models of endothelial cells, since brain endothelial cells lose their characteristics when in culture. Moreover, the remarkable importance of the neurovascular unit cells in inducing and maintaining the properties of the BBB was established and recognized as fundamental. As a result, monoculture models were gradually replaced by co-culture models <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>.</p><p>The shift to multicellular models, in which one or more cells of the neurovascular unit are introduced, has greatly contributed for improving the potential of the models, especially in the case of drug permeability screening. The most widely mentioned co-culture models are those created using astrocytes and/or pericytes together with endothelial cells, as they play a very important role in developing a tight paracellular barrier and in modulating brain endothelial cells' functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. The models can be either syngeneic or developed using cellular components of different origins (e.g., bovine brain endothelial cells in coculture with rat astrocytes). The advantages of this interaction between different cellular components include an increased expression of transporters and the induction of tight junctions and cell polarity in brain endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_28">27</ref> compiles the main advantages of using the cellular components that form the neurovascular unit in co-culture with brain endothelial cells. Thus, the transition from monoculture to co-culture models has narrowed the gap that existed in trying to recreate, as faithfully as possible through in vitro models, the actual microenvironment of the human BBB. Despite the benefits, some shortcomings are attributed to this enhancement. As a result of the synergistic combination of various cell types, the limitations regarding the permeability and TEER values have been effectively improved, but, even then, the models fail to attempt to approximate these values to those associated with the human BBB phenotype. The interspecies variability stands out, and the issue of obtaining neurovascular unit cells of human origin also becomes an obstacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>.</p><p>The execution of co-culture protocols offers flexibility in the experimental design, even allowing mechanistic studies on the contribution of each cell type in toxicity studies, for example. It should also be noted that working with different culture systems increases the complexity of the work, as each one requires different treatments at different times. It becomes fundamental (i) to know the morphology of the cells to ensure their viability throughout the assay; (ii) to know the correct time to change the medium, so as not to cause cell death and destabilize the growth of other cells; (iii) to know the correct timing of seeding (the model may not work as efficiently as anticipated and the TEER values obtained may not match the predicted values); and (iv) to guarantee the absence of contaminations.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">From Static to Dynamic In Vitro Models of the Blood-Brain Barrier</head><p>In addition to the impetus in the structural shift from monoculture to co-culture models, the complexity of the different forms of modeling, in vitro, of the BBB has also evolved. Early BBB studies relied on brain endothelial cells in monoculture in Petri dishes. Using this simple and inexpensive method, cells were used for biochemical, physiological, and cytotoxicity studies. As a main advantage, the use of the Petri dish allows the use of a large number of cells and the easy identification of them. However, as a key limitation, this model does not allow the performance of drug permeability assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>. Therefore, and in order to eliminate its main limitation, this method was replaced by another well-known, and previously mentioned, static method. In Transwell systems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>), cells are seeded and submerged in the appropriate medium, allowing to replicate the "blood side" and the "brain side". This method also allows the co-culturing of brain endothelial cells with other types of cells from the neurovascular unit, and also allows the detaching of the cells from the platform and the collection of them to carry out further studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>. In these models, the different types of cells can be placed in direct or indirect contact with each other (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). This fact can also influence the phenotype of the BBB obtained <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In a study conducted by Malina and colleagues, in 2009, three different configurations of in vitro BBB were described and compared: (i) primary culture of porcine brain endothelial cells in monoculture; (ii) a non-contact co-culture model of porcine brain endothelial cells with rat brain glial cells, and (iii) a contact co-culture model of porcine brain endothelial cells with rat brain glial cells. They found that the contact co-culture model generates better results concerning the BBB tightness and P-gp functionality and, consequently, gives rise to an improved and reliable model with similar characteristics to those described in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>.</p><p>Although widely used, the shortcomings previously mentioned to the Transwell systems can contribute to change the ability of models to make the most correct and reliable in vitro predictions of expected responses in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>.</p><p>The need for studying the contribution, not only of other cells such as astrocytes and pericytes, but also of the blood flow has driven the creation and development of dynamic models <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104]</ref>. One of those models is the dynamic in vitro (DIV) system. This model uses co-culture and consists in creating intraluminal flow through hallow fibers, recreating artificial capillary-like supports. The brain endothelial cells are cultured inside of a closed chamber, located in the lumen of the hollow fibers. Those cells are then exposed to flow, while other cells are seeded in the extraluminal compartment. The intraluminal flow is regulated by a pulsatile pump, which can be controlled to generate the desirable pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>. Recently, other dynamic models using 3D systems have been developed. The latest advances in the previously mentioned microfluidic have allowed the creation of more complex and reliable models, popular in research fields, called "organ-on-a-chip", which will be detailed below <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">105]</ref>.</p><p>The more conventional types of 3D cell cultures include the hanging-drop method, the forced-floating method, matrices and scaffolds, and agitation-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>The hanging-drop method consists of creating spheroids, using a simple plate. A small number of cells are seeded, and then the plate is inverted, causing the seeded cells to form a hanging droplet. Hence, the cells are concentrated at the tip of the drop, remaining in place due to surface tension. Over time, the spheroids form compact structures with a more homogeneous structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>In the forced-floating method, by using a simple 96-well plate, the cells are grown to form spheroids in a way that prevents them from attaching to the surface, thereby promoting cell-to-cell interactions. The typically used substance to prevent the adhesion of cells to the surface is the poly-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA), but also agarose is described for coating <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>The matrices' and scaffolds' technology resorts to an extracellular matrix to produce 3D-spheroids. There is sterile extracellular matrix commercially available, being used to grow cells within or on top of the gel. For scaffolds-based culture, the most commonly used substances to construct prefabricated systems are collagen, laminin, and alginate. Those scaffolds models include a group of fibers, whereby the cells can easily migrate and attach near to the other cells. The growth of the previously seeded cells allows the interstitial space between the fibers to be filled, thus giving rise to a 3D morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>The agitation-based approaches allow the cells to grow without adhering to the walls, consequently forming a stronger cell-to-cell interaction once the cells are placed in suspension in a container and a device keeps them in constant motion. The two most widely used technologies are the spinner flask bioreactor and rotating cell culture bioreactors. In the first, the material to be used includes a container and a stirring element. The cell suspension is continuously stirring and, varying the magnitude of the container that holds them, the spheroids can have different sizes. In the rotating cell culture bioreactors, the only difference from the preceding one is that the entire container is in constant rotation. There are other technologies involving bioreactors, although not as widely used as the rotatory perfusion systems (allow a continuous supply of medium to the cell chamber from external media bottles) and compression bioreactors (provides, in vitro, both mechanical and physiological stimuli for the cells to be more similar to the in vivo conditions; often used in cartilage engineering) <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[106]</ref>.</p><p>The combination of 3D models of cell cultures with microfluidic technology has made it possible to obtain systems that are more compatible with the BBB characteristics in humans.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">A Compendium of the Applicability of Co-Culture Models in Permeability Studies</head><p>This sub-section compiles some in vitro studies reported in the literature using different co-culture models for the evaluation of the permeability across the BBB. The tables organize the studies into categories (studies of primary endothelial cells, immortalized endothelial cells, and stem cells), highlighting the advantages of including other cell types, previously explored, with endothelial cells, as well as some limitations encountered by the authors in validating the models.</p><p>As previously mentioned in Section 2, primary cells, despite the time-consuming and laborious isolation process, have advantages related to the high TEER values and to the more relevant physiological characteristics, when compared to immortalized cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. The intention of co-culturing the primary cells with, for example, astrocytes aimed to create improved models (given the discovery of the importance of the communication between the various cell types of the BBB for its phenotype), that truly recapitulate the transport and permeability mechanisms of BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[110]</ref>. The following table gathers the main advantages of co-culturing primary endothelial cells with other cell types (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_32">29</ref>).  The immortalized cell lines were obtained to overcome the limitations of primary cells, regarding the difficulty of obtaining cells of human origin, to decrease the interspecies variability and their limited lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. One of the most widely used immortalized human cell line in in vitro studies is the hCMEC/D3 cell line, although the tightness of the monolayer is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. A study conducted by Hinkel and colleagues, in 2019, performed a parametric investigation in both static and dynamic cell culture models, aiming to improve the hCMEC/D3 cell line limitation. The study evaluated several points, namely the medium supplementation, contact and non-contact co-cultivation with the human astrocytic cell line SVGmm and the implementation of flow conditions that, as formerly mentioned, are beneficial. The dynamic model used in the study was a dynamic micro tissue engineering system, which allows the consideration of the vascular microenvironment and constantly fills the compartments with fresh medium. Changes in TEER values were monitored. The authors concluded that, regarding the TEER values, hCMEC/D3 cells did not respond positively to any tested parameter [70]. This observation was in support with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. The hCMEC/D3 cells are widely used in in vitro assays, but these limitations support that further improvements or alternative cell cultures are needed to obtain more accurate and reproducible results.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_34">30</ref> collects the advantages and limitations of co-culturing endothelial cell lines with other cell types. by assessing rhodamine 123 permeability), and the ability to discriminate between CNS permeable and non-permeable substances. Additionally, an upregulation of tight junction proteins (e.g., claudins) and neurotransmitter transporters, as well as changes in several signaling pathways (e.g., WNT, TNF, and PI3K-Akt) were also observed upon co-culture. Overall, these findings suggest that the co-culture of iPSC-derived endothelial cells with other cell types affects the maturity of the endothelial cells, promoting barrier formation at both the functional and transcriptional levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>.</p><p>In 2019, a human in vitro BBB model using iPSC-derived endothelial cells was developed by Li and colleagues to be successfully applied in the in vivo prediction of drug permeability. The developed model exhibited several BBB characteristics, namely the presence of distinct tight junction proteins (claudin-5, ZO-1, and occludin) and endothelial markers (von Willebrand factor and Ulex). Moreover, the model showed high TEER values (1560 Ω•cm 2 ± 230 Ω•cm 2 ), as well as γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. Remarkably, by co-culturing iPSC-derived endothelial cells with primary rat astrocytes, a significant increase in the TEER values was observed (2970 Ω•cm 2 to 4185 Ω•cm 2 ). Furthermore, the upregulation of key BBB-related genes was confirmed in human iPSC-derived endothelial cells when compared to primary human BMECs, including BCRP and P-gp. Noteworthy, drug transport assays were performed for nine CNS compounds. A strong correlation was observed between the data obtained for the permeability of non-P-gp/BCRP and P-gp/BCRP substrates across the developed model and the data obtained in rodents following in situ brain perfusion of the same compounds. Overall, these findings suggest that the developed model can be successfully applied for the screening of CNS compounds, in prediction of the in vivo BBB permeability of several compounds or even to study the BBB function/biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">[126]</ref>.</p><p>Given the complexity of the neurovascular unit, Canfield and colleagues hypothesized that the BBB phenotype of iPSC-derived BMECs could be improved upon co-culture with iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes, thus developing a robust multicellular human BBB model. Initially, iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes were cultured with primary rat BMECs, and an increased barrier tightening was observed. Co-culture of iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes with iPSC-derived BMECs resulted in a significant increase in TEER value, decreased passive permeability, and the enhancement of tight junction continuity in BMECs, while P-gp efflux activity remained unchanged. A neural cell mixture composed of one neuron to three astrocytes resulted in the most optimal induction of BMEC properties. Lastly, by using BMECs, astrocytes, and neurons derived from the same donor iPSC source, an isogenic multicellular BBB model was successfully achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[127]</ref>. Later, in 2019, the same authors developed a co-culture model of iPSC-derived BMECs, neurons, astrocytes, and brain-like pericytes to better recreate in vitro the complexity of the neurovascular unit. For that purpose, BMECs were co-cultured with neurons, astrocytes, and/or pericytes, alone or in several combinations, and the barrier properties were then evaluated. The most significant barrier tightening was observed when BMECs were co-cultured with pericytes followed by a mixture of neurons and astrocytes (1:3), as demonstrated by a significant increase in the junctional localization of occludin. Moreover, under baseline BMEC monoculture conditions, BMECs also expressed active P-gp, and this expression was maintained regardless of co-culture conditions. Lastly, co-culturing of BMECs with brain-like pericytes significantly decreased the rate of non-specific transcytosis across BMECs. Overall, the developed co-culture model of the neurovascular unit, with different cell types originated from the same donor, allowed the development of an isogenic model that could represent a useful tool to model the human neurovascular unit in health and disease, including to better understand the interplay between the different cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[128]</ref>.</p><p>In 2021, Noorani and colleagues developed and validated a quasi-physiological microfluidic BBB model suitable for brain permeability studies. By juxtaposing iPSC-derived BMECs with primary human pericytes and astrocytes, a co-culture model was developed, which exhibited BBB-specific characteristics, including low paracellular permeability, efflux activity, and osmotic responses. Indeed, the obtained BBB model exhibited continuous tight-junction patterns, low permeability to mannitol and sucrose, and quasi-physiological responses to both hyperosmolar opening (observed through a decreased BBB integrity) and P-glycoprotein inhibition (observed through an increased permeability of rhodamine 123, a P-glycoprotein substrate). Furthermore, the creation of a tight barrier and the extended long-term viability of the developed model, which is suitable for time-course studies, was ensured by the environmental signals provided by the astrocytes and pericytes located at the abluminal side of the vascular channel. Overall, this innovative co-culture microfluidic platform demonstrated the capability to replicate a quasi-physiological brain microvasculature, thereby facilitating the creation of a highly predictive and translationally relevant BBB model <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[129]</ref>. iPSCs-induced pluripotent stem cells; GLUT-glucose transporter; P-gp-P-glycoprotein; TEERtransendothelial electrical resistance; ZO-zonula occludens; BCRP-breast cancer resistance protein; MRPmultidrug resistance-associated protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Relevance of In Vitro Co-Culture Models in Neurotoxicity Assessments</head><p>Humans are exposed daily to several potentially toxic chemicals present in the environment that, given their lipophilic nature, can easily cross the BBB and induce neurotoxicity. Among these environmental chemicals are the heavy metals, such mercury, and organic chemicals, such as pesticides and industrial surfactants <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>. In fact, several studies linked this exposure to neurodevelopment disorders and neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>. Given the inherent limitations of primary and immortalized endothelial cells, and that even with co-culture they still fail to approach the TEER values observed in vivo, an easy solution would be to perform more detailed/mechanistic studies at the target level, directly in the neuronal cells. The truth is that developments in the field of translational toxicology make it possible to seek complementary information, namely permeability of compounds at the BBB level to, for example, in silico assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>. Thus, eliminating the need to use endothelial cells as a barrier model, the focus becomes the neuronal response, which also benefits from co-culture with other cells. This point is then explored, providing examples, whenever relevant, of co-culture models with endothelial cells used for neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration research.</p><p>The field of translational toxicology brings together epidemiological studies, in silico, in vivo, and in vitro assessments, to quantify and predict the impact of such exposure on the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">134]</ref>. The epidemiological studies allow us to relate, through statistical analysis, the exposure to a chemical to a given disease, thus corroborating the risk of developing pathology and neuronal changes with exposure to potentially toxic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. In the translational in silico approach, advances in computational modeling enables to estimate the toxic potential of compounds to cause neuronal damage, based on its structure, physicochemical, and biological characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. Another type of translational technique involves in vitro models, through which it is possible to carry out preliminary tests to identify and characterize neurotoxic substances and to perform studies, at the molecular level, to assess mechanisms, biomarkers, and possible pathways for adverse effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>. Finally, using animal models, it is possible to perform in vivo studies about neurobehavioral and other qualitative tests to evaluate changes and damage in the CNS, such as biomarker analysis and gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134]</ref>.</p><p>The epidemiological studies fail in providing mechanistic studies to understand how the toxicant affects the cells. On the other hand, mouse, fish, or monkey animal models are used in in vivo neurotoxicity assays, but these models still have limitations related to the interspecies variability (namely in the expression of ion channels and neurotransmitter synthetase). This makes animal models a real challenge to extrapolate the gathered information into humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135]</ref>. In the past few years, in vitro techniques to perform risk assessments have emerged. In vitro assays are also popular in drug screening, in studies of drug transport and metabolism and to test drug-drug interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In addition, other aspects have been driving the replacement of animal models by in vitro models, namely the fact that in vitro tests allow potentially toxic compounds to be reliably analyzed in more realistic concentrations; decrease in costs, by eliminating the need of animals use; increase in the reliability of safety testing and the legislative pressure to develop alternatives to in vivo testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>When conducting studies to evaluate the neurotoxicity of compounds, it is worth taking into account the complexity of the nervous system itself. Several points must be considered, since they act as facilitators for the induction of neurotoxicity, related to: (i) the lipid-rich structures; (ii) the BBB itself; (iii) the energy requirement; (iv) the synaptic transmission; (v) neural cell structure and, finally, (vi) related to the biochemistry of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>As it has been discussed, the BBB limits the crossing of certain substances from blood into the CNS. Nonetheless, the membranes are lipid-based structures and, therefore, they can accumulate lipophilic compounds, such as methylmercury <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>. The neurotoxicity can also be due to certain environmental precursor substances, as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), that crosses the BBB and then is metabolically activated by MAO-B present in astrocytes to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), causing neuronal degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">136]</ref>. This provides an example of how cells that make up the BBB can play an active role in xenobiotic-induced toxicity.</p><p>Neurons require ATP in a larger amount to comply with generating and maintaining the membrane potential. Having as a major source of energy the oxidative phosphorylation, neurons become highly vulnerable to inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Examples of toxicants include rotenone and carbon monoxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>The synaptic transmission is a key function of the nervous system and, therefore, a potential target of neurotoxicants. The toxic compounds can target the neurotransmitter release, inhibiting it. A good example is the botulinum neurotoxins. The receptors may also be affected, as it happens for curare and nicotine, both affecting the nicotinic receptors of acetylcholine. At last, the clearance of the neurotransmitters may also be affected (organophosphates inhibit the acetylcholinesterase activity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>Neurons develop very long projections called axons, which are also a recognizable target of toxicants. The substance taxol is known to cause cytoskeleton disruption and impair intracellular transport, leading to peripheral neuropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>Regarding neuronal biochemistry, it is important to note that dopamine neurotransmitters, produced by dopaminergic neurons, quickly autoxidize. Thus, compounds that increase the release of dopamine, such as methamphetamine, or compounds that act as reuptake/degradation inhibitors (e.g., cocaine), can contribute to increased levels of radicals that damage cells, by intensifying the autoxidation rate of dopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>Thus, since xenobiotics can have several targets where they can exert their toxic effects, the endpoints to generate more accurate neurotoxicity outputs that must be taken in consideration when performing the assays are related to (i) cell viability/death (e.g., direct counting death cells, apoptosis markers); (ii) evaluation of cell differentiation; (iii) morphological and functional analysis (e.g., cell migration, neurite integrity, glucose uptake, energy metabolism, formation of reactive oxygen species, calcium influx, cell membrane potential); (iv) neuronal specific functions (e.g., electrical activity, neurotransmission); (v) genetic expression profiles, and (vi) neurochemical targets (e.g., enzymatic activity, ion channel function) <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137]</ref>. The analytic methods most commonly used for both neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity screenings are spectrophotometric, fluorimetric, and luminometric methods, impedance measurements, electrophysiological screens (e.g., patch-clamp technique), high-content imaging, multichannel parallel microscopy cytometry, transcriptomics, microRNA profiling, and metabolomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[135]</ref>.</p><p>Despite the advantage in bringing the in vitro models progressively closer to the BBB phenotype (including recent advances in microfluidic systems), the use of co-culture models has a more pertinent advantage in this type of assay. By co-culturing cells from the neurovascular unit, it is possible not only to increase the tightness in the model, as well as to reduce the permeability, but also to upregulate the expression of ABC transporters, especially P-gp. As stated before, this upregulation is achieved mostly by culturing astrocytes with endothelial cells (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_28">27</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. P-gp is a protein from the ABC transporters superfamily, responsible for the efflux of both endogenous and exogenous substances from inside the cells, thereby controlling their accumulation. ABC transporters, including P-gp, present at the BBB, play an important neuroprotective role, by limiting the accumulation of neurotoxicants. Its activity can be induced, activated, or inhibited according to the type of experiment to be performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. For example, if the main goal is to evaluate the implication of ABC transporters in drug efflux, when performing a drug permeability study, inhibitors can be used, and the results compared to the non-inhibited conditions. Since efflux transporters show some synergetic effects, studies can be conducted using compounds with affinity for more than one transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Tariquidar and elacridar are two examples of ABC transporters inhibitors, since both can inhibit not only P-gp but also the BCRP transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Using a co-culture-based cell model Megard and colleagues, in 2002, conducted a study regarding the BBB penetration of indinavir <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. They developed a human in vitro model based on the co-culture of HBEMCs with human primary astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. The results highlighted that the permeability to sucrose of the co-culture model was lower, when compared to the monoculture model of brain endothelial cells. In addition, the co-culture model showed expression of functional P-gp. This result supports the idea that the close contact of astrocytes with endothelial cells gives rise to an improved BBB model to conduct drug permeability studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. Indinavir flux in the apical-to-basolateral direction was low in the co-culture model. When the P-gp inhibitor, quinidine (5 µM for 30 min) was added, there was a significant increase in the amount of indinavir reaching the basolateral compartment in the Transwell system. These results show indinavir as a P-gp substrate, thus confirming P-gp role in preventing its entry into the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[116]</ref>. In 2013, Ji and colleagues study the influence of dolichyl-phosphate (a glycosyl carrier lipid, playing an important role in the generation of glycoproteins) on P-gp activity, using a co-culture model of RBMECs and primary rat astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>. Incubation of the co-culture model with the compound (concentrations of 1-4 µM, for 1 and 4 h) did not significantly change tight junctions, but instead caused a reduction in the transport of rhodamine 123 and Aβ42, both P-gp substrates, from basolateral to apical compartment. This indicated that dolichyl-phosphate inhibits P-gp activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[138]</ref>.</p><p>Co-culture models resorting to microglia cells are also relevant tools in neurotoxicity studies, mainly used to understand the microglia-induced damage to the CNS, once inflammation caused by microglia cells is implicated in structural and functional neuronal changes in this system. For example, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), components from Gram-negative bacteria membrane, and amyloid-β proteins lead the microglia cells to release an inflammatory response to eliminate the trigger responsible for its activation and repair the damage caused to the CNS. However, overactivated microglia cells can cause neuronal damage, including demyelination and even neuronal degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. Based on this, Brás and colleagues, in 2020, using a microfluid system (Axon Investigation System) created a co-culture model of microglia (N9 microglial cell line) with hippocampal neurons (from E17 C57BL/6 mice) to evaluate the impact of microglia overactivation on both neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, produced mainly by activated microglia, capable of modulating the most diverse biological responses, from apoptosis to cell differentiation or inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. The authors showed an upregulation of miR-342 microRNA in TNF-α-stimulated primary rat microglia. In addition, in the co-culture model, either microglia stimulation with TNF-α (20 ng/mL for 6 h) or microglia transfection with miR-342 dramatically decreased neuronal viability <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>. The following hypotheses were raised by the authors to explain the decreased neuronal viability: (i) increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α (pointed out as disruptors of the neuronal excitatory/inhibitory ratio); (ii) increased levels of nitrites (microglial-derived nitrites are involved in neuronal respiration inhibition, culminating in excitotoxicity by glutamate release), found in the supernatants of those co-cultures. In conclusion, resorting to the co-culture model, the authors were able to correlate the TNF-α-induced miR-342 with neurotoxicity, through microglia activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref>.</p><p>In another example evaluating the neurotoxicity of compounds using monocultures and co-culture models, in 2012, Cardoso and colleagues performed an assay involving monolayers of primary rat microvascular endothelial cells and a co-culture model of primary rat microvascular endothelial cells with astroglial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>. They observed that, following exposure to LPS (1 µg/mL, for 4 or 24 h) or unconjugated bilirubin (50 µM, for 4 or 24 h), both models showed a decrease in TEER values, while their permeability increased. However, the effect was less pronounced in the co-culture model <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>. This was in agreement with studies previously performed, where it was highlighted that the presence of astrocytes helped to fortify the barrier function and helped to prevent endothelial cell permeability, thus concluding that the co-culture model is an improved tool for this type of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref>. Another example that includes astrocytes in co-culture is the study conducted by Haruki and colleagues, in 2013. The aim of that study was to identify the mechanism of astrocyte damage in neuromyelitis optica, an inflammatory condition that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. Based on the discovery of autoantibodies against the aquaporin-4 water channel of astrocytes, the authors used human astrocytes and immortalized them with the temperature-sensitive Simian virus 40 large T-antigen and aquaporin-4 cDNA. The authors designated this astrocytic cell line as hAST-AQP4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. The assays performed, using neuromyelitis optica patients' sera, consisted of (i) evaluation of the sera effects on both the quantity and localization of aquaporin-4 (cytotoxicity and changes in astrocytes morphology were performed) and (ii) by co-culturing the astrocytic cell line, previously created, with the immortalized cell line TY09, they analyzed the influence of the direct contact with the endothelial cells on the expression and localization of the protein in the astrocytes. The results showed that sera from patients with the pathology effectively induced cytotoxicity in astrocytes, altering their morphology as well as the localization and expression of aquaporin-4 (decreased levels in hAST-AQP4). Regarding the effects of coculture, the authors verified the positive influence of the direct contact between astrocytes and endothelial cells. Indeed, the expression of the aquaporin-4 in the hAST-AQP4 cells co-cultured with the TY09 cell line was higher, when compared to the monoculture model of the hAST-AQP4 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. The main conclusion is that the expression and localization of this water channel is influenced by the close contact of astrocytes with endothelial cells, thus demonstrating that this in vitro model has characteristics more similar to those observed in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p><p>The SH-SY5Y cell line is another example of relevance in neurotoxicity assessments, in addition to its importance in studies related to neurodegenerative diseases, notably PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>. De Simone and colleagues, in 2017, created a co-culture model, aiming to add a relevant in vitro model to the portfolio of in vitro models used for toxicological studies <ref type="bibr">[142]</ref>. Using a Transwell system, the model consisted of human neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y cell line) co-cultured with human astrocytes (D384 cell line), and the main goal was to evaluate its neuroprotective role, resulting from cell-cell interaction in co-culture, against three well-established neurotoxicants: methylmercury (1-2.5 µM, for 24 and 48 h), iron nanoparticles (1-100 µg/mL, for 24 and 48 h), and methylglyoxal (0.5-1 mM, for 24 and 48 h). The assay consisted of the analysis of mitochondrial function and cell morphology in the monoculture exposed to the toxicants, comparing the results with exposure to the same compounds in the co-culture model <ref type="bibr">[142]</ref>. The three compounds tested were able to cause a significant impairment in the mitochondrial activity and cell morphology in both the monoculture and co-culture models. The release of high levels of iron from the iron nanoparticles is capable of compromising cell viability, as well as iron transportation and storage. Since it is recognized that astrocytes can accumulate iron from exogenous sources, in a time/concentration dependency, the study confirmed that neurons are less susceptible than astrocytes to suffer damage from iron accumulation (results show less iron accumulation in the SH-SY5Y cell line, when compared to the D384 astrocytic cell line). Regarding concerns with methylmercury exposure, the authors confirmed that the neurons showed less alterations when compared to the monoculture model regarding mitochondrial activity and cell membrane integrity. This was also found in another previous study using neurons and astrocytes in co-culture, which was performed by Yin and colleagues, in 2009, and by Morken and colleagues, in 2005 <ref type="bibr">[142]</ref>. The main conclusion of this study was that, after exposure, the culture demonstrated enlightened neuronal survival over time. Indeed, the model of neurons co-cultured with astrocytes can diminish the cytotoxic effects of the neurotoxicants in the cells, thus indicating the protective effect of astrocytes to neurons and vice versa, during short exposure to toxicants (24-48 h) <ref type="bibr">[142]</ref>. Another example lies in the study carried out by Ferraro and colleagues, in 2020, that, using the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, studied the neurotoxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. The cells were exposed to the nanoparticles (5, 10, 50, or 100 µg/mL) for 24 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>. The results have shown alterations in: (i) cell viability, as well as the ability of the nanoparticles to induce apoptotic cell death; (ii) reactive oxygen species generation; (iii) antioxidant response (significant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) activation; (iv) endoplasmic reticulum stress, and (v) autophagy in cells. All these results indicated that nanoparticles caused significant neurotoxicity and cell death. Furthermore, based on the main findings, the authors also conclude that more studies are needed to further understand the biological response to titanium dioxide nanoparticles, resorting to SH-SY5Y cells co-cultured with microglia cells, for its relevance in oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">[143]</ref>.</p><p>In 2019, Zhao and colleagues developed an in vitro co-culture model to assess the effect of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity on DNA methylation in astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>. Astrocytes express glutamate receptors, which are activated by the glutamate released from excited neurons. Indeed, astrocytes are capable of responding to neuronal activities, since they are the main cells responsible for removing extracellular glutamate, playing a pivotal role in mitigating its excitotoxicity. DNA methylation seems to be responsible for inhibiting the glutamate transporter (EAAT-2) expression in astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>. Thus, the researchers created an in vitro co-culture model of primary neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells from rats, using a Transwell system (neurons were seeded on the bottom of the lower chamber; endothelial cells were seeded on the top membrane, while astrocytes were seeded on the bottom membrane of the insert) and, after the co-culturing different concentrations of glutamate were added and the excitotoxicity and as the DNA methylation was evaluated in astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>. The results elucidated that, after glutamate exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr">200</ref>, 500, and 1000 µM), the neuronal damage was lower in the co-culture model, when compared to the control group (neurons and astrocytes in monoculture). In contrast, the number of astrocytes was reduced. Concerning DNA methylation, in the co-culture model, both DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3 expression in astrocytes was increased. In parallel, they examined the effect of MK-801 (10 µM) and 5-AzaC (0.5 µM) in reducing the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in neurons. The results revealed that the addition of the inhibitors, on the membrane of the Transwell system containing the endothelial cells (to mimic the passage of drugs through to the BBB, thus entering the CNS), was able to efficiently block not only the increased methylation of astrocytes, resulting from glutamate exposure, but also the neuronal damage. Therefore, this model demonstrated to be an improved system to study glutamate-induced toxicity, approximating its characteristics as closely as possible to those found in vivo. The results also allowed to conclude that targeting astrocytes may constitute a new therapeutical strategy in neurological disorders related to an excessive rate of glutamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">[144]</ref>.</p><p>One study that highlights the relevance of 3D co-culture models in this type of assessments was published in 2017, where Terrasso and colleagues created a 3D human cell model of neurons and astrocytes to assess the neuroprotective role of 36 compounds (from chemical-synthetized compounds to natural extracts) against oxidative stress caused by chloramphenicol (exposure to 4.3 mM, for 48 h) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (exposure to 280 µM, for 48 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. The 3D co-culture model was established by the differentiation of the pluripotent embryonic carcinoma-derived NTera-2/clone D1 (NT2) cell line, using an agitation-based culture system (previously displayed in Section 3.2). After generation of the 3D neuron-astrocyte aggregates, they were collected from the spinner vessels, evaluated for diameter stability, which was kept stable, and then distributed in 96-well plates for cell viability endpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. They used as the positive control the antioxidant idebenone, which proved to have a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect on the injury induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide. The result was consistent with previous studies using in vitro cultures of neural cells (primary cortical neurons and immortalized neural cells), in which idebenone also conferred neuroprotection against oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. The way the model was developed allowed taking into account both cell-cell metabolic and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, mutually biological relevant events to more accurate outputs in toxicity screenings <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>. The results demonstrated the simplicity and applicability of the high-throughput neuroprotection assay, which, combined with the easy evaluation of the fluorescence-based cell viability endpoint, proved to be a suitable model for drug screening assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[145]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">The Use of In Vitro Co-Culture Models in the Study of Neurodegenerative Diseases</head><p>In addition to their relevance in neurotoxicity studies, in vitro cell-based models have also been widely used in neuroscience studies related to neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>. Indeed, in vitro BBB modeling can be used for three major categories of studies: toxicological evaluations, BBB transport studies, and target validation at the disease mechanism as well as its therapeutical implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>. The potential of many promising compounds to act on the CNS is diminished by the presence of the BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>. Moreover, the BBB is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. Its dysfunction in various pathologies may impair the transport and permeability of substances, causing alterations in the regulatory mechanisms between endothelium and its associated cells, such as neurons and glia cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>. Thus, by modeling the BBB it is possible to make not only an uptake prediction of potential new candidates for the treatment of CNS pathologies, but also to assess the risk of using such compounds in pharmaceutical development, generating information with impact on drug design <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[147]</ref>.</p><p>Historically, only neurons have been considered in in vitro studies designed to develop new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have elucidated the importance of astrocytes in maintaining a proper neuronal function. In reality, astrocytic alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">148]</ref>. Perturbations in protein processing, trafficking, and aggregation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref>. This inability to maintain protein homeostasis results in extracellular accumulation and, consequently, in the induction of local inflammation due to the activation of astrocytes and microglia <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref>. Thus, considering the key biological functions of astrocytes, their dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">148]</ref>. For example, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), large accumulation of tau protein in astrocytes has been associated with the diminished expression of glutamate transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[148]</ref>. Considering that dysfunctional glutamate neurotransmission has been associated with neuronal death, this supports a role for astrocytes in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. <ref type="bibr">[149]</ref>. The role of microglia cells in neurological disorders is related to their double phenotype, pro-inflammatory phenotype M1 and anti-inflammatory phenotype M2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[146]</ref>. Indeed, some inflammationinducing factors are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, being responsible for the amplification of the inflammatory response with the production of neurotoxic mediators, such as cytokines and interleukins. Those neurotoxic mediators are commonly related to intracellular mechanisms described in these pathologies, such as protein degradation, mitochondrial and axonal dysfunction, and apoptosis <ref type="bibr">[150]</ref>.</p><p>Enright and colleagues, in 2020, performed an assay that was able to elucidate the advantage of co-culture models in obtaining neuronal responses as close as possible to the in vivo conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. Resorting to a microfabricated multi-electrode array (MEA), they created a complex model of primary rat cortical neurons co-cultured with primary rat astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to perform morphological, functional, and transcriptional analysis. Like astrocytes, oligodendrocytes secrete certain factors responsible for intervening in the maturation of neurons, as well as in processes like synaptogenesis. In addition, they are also able to provide metabolic support and to promote myelination of axons, thus enhancing both the speed and efficacy of nerve conduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>. Making the comparison between a neuronal monoculture and the co-culture system (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), they showed that the co-culture system presented (i) a high number of regions with higher neuronal density and differences in synaptophysin expression; (ii) a higher expression of genes involved in synapses, network formation, and cell signaling processes, and (iii) a higher neuronal activity, as well as better synchronization on the electrophysiological activity measurements. The authors concluded that the co-culture model can mimic more closely the in vivo neuronal responses by taking into consideration the cell-cell interactions, therefore providing an improved tool for testing drugs, toxicants, or even disease mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b150">[151]</ref>.</p><p>In 2021, Mursaleen and colleagues developed an in vitro co-culture model of immortalized endothelial cells, hCMEC/D3 cells, with the neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y that elucidates the BBB modeling for drug delivery and target validation <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>. In in vivo studies, hydroxytyrosol has shown a low capacity to cross the BBB. To overcome this problem, the authors used micellar nanocarriers to enhance the passage across the BBB and used rotenone (concentration of 100 µM) to mimic a PD phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>. They showed that micellar nanocarriers containing hydroxytyrosol were capable of crossing the BBB, in vitro, without causing cytotoxicity, and protected the neuronal SH-SY5Y cells against rotenone-induced oxidative stress (assessing by mitochondrial hydroxyl levels) <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref>.</p><p>In the last part of this review, we will address studies that made use of co-culture models to explore neurodegenerative disease mechanisms. We will focus on the three most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These three neurodegenerative disorders have in common the fact that both incidence and prevalence increase with age and, although some cases are familial, most cases are sporadic with onset at early age <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">[153,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">154]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.1.">Alzheimer's Disease</head><p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder, leading to loss of cognitive functions, changes in social behavior and basic tasks impairment, such as memory, swallowing, and walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">156]</ref>. The progressive neurodegeneration is accompanied mostly by the accumulation of senile plaques (extracellular aggregates of amyloid-β peptides) and neurofibrillary tangles (intracellular inclusions of tau proteins) <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref>. Moreover, other pathological signs have been described, as inflammation, BBB disruption, metabolic disruptions, degraded cellular pathways, and increased DNA damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157]</ref>.</p><p>In 2017, Mehrabadi and colleagues used a co-culture model to analyze if microglia cells can affect the BBB integrity. Since microglia cells closely interact with endothelial cells, they can influence the infiltration of peripheral cells by releasing cytokine/chemokine molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. In a previous study made by the same group, they identified the presence of PARP-1 as necessary to regulate the microglia activation, the release of NOS/ROS and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. The immortalized mouse brain endothelial b.END3 cell line was co-cultured with primary microglia cells from rats. The microglia cells were exposed to amyloid-β and/or PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 (5 µM for 24 h) for trigger microglia activation and the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in endothelial cells was then evaluated. Amyloid-β-exposed microglia reduced the expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin by co-cultured endothelial cells, an effect fully prevented when co-cultured microglia cells were treated with amyloid-β and PARP-1 inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. The reduced expression of tight junctional proteins and the consequent increase in the paracellular permeability were further studied by the determination of the microglia phenotype. The pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype is described to cause the BBB opening. Thus, the authors investigated the presence of phenotype biomarkers for BBB opening, such as nitric oxide and TNF-α, both present after amyloid-β exposure. The confirmation of the ability of these compounds to alter the junctional proteins in the endothelial cells was also assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. Exposure to sodium nitroprusside (source of nitric oxide, concentrations of 20 e 40 µM) reduced occludin expression but did not affect the ZO-1 expression. Meanwhile, exposure to TNF-α (30 and 50 ng/mL) decreased the ZO-1 expression, with no changes in the occludin expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>. Exposure to both molecules caused an increase in the permeability of fluorescein-labeled dextran and IRDye 800 PEG. This co-culture model of endothelial cells with microglia elucidated the effects of cell-cell communication, allowing the authors to conclude that the microglia can interfere with endothelial cells barrier function and the deleterious effects of amyloid-β-activated microglia are dependent on PARP-1 activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref>.</p><p>Related to the impact of energy metabolic disruption in AD, Hong and colleagues, in 2020, investigated the potential role of the SLC transporter monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT-4) as a putative target in the treatment of AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. The authors performed in vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro experiments were performed in a co-culture model of primary neuronal cells and astrocytes from the hippocampi of day 16 embryos of APP/PS1 mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. In astrocytes, the intracellular transportation of lactic acid is made via MCT-4. It was shown that: (i) increased expression of MCT-4 in astrocytes stemmed in the accumulation of lactic acid in the astrocyte's stroma, resulting in acidosis; (ii) as a consequence of MCT-4 overexpression, neuronal proliferation was diminished and the apoptosis rate was enlarged; (iii) higher content of lactic acid in stroma increased neuronal oxidative phosphorylation; (iv) acidosis can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. Therefore, the changes in the co-culture model, involving the MCT-4 transporter, compromised the neuronal mitochondrial function, lactate metabolism and apoptosis rate. In the in vivo experiment, after knocking down the expression of MCT-4 in APP/PS1 mice, they verified that the apoptotic rate of neurons was reduced, and the cognitive function of mice was improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>. By combining the results obtained in vitro, in the co-culture model, with the results of the intervention on transporter expression in vivo, it was possible to establish a correlation between the energy metabolism of astrocytes and AD pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">[155]</ref>.</p><p>In 2018, Gupta and colleagues also performed an assay related to the link between metabolic impairments and sporadic AD, more specifically insulin signaling disfunction, a risk factor leading to disturbances in learning and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. In that study, they analyzed the metabolic status of glial and neuronal cells and tried to understand how the crosstalk between these cells can influence the progression of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. The intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (a non-transgenic metabolic model) causes abnormalities in insulin signaling/glucose metabolism. In fact, streptozotocin is a compound able to demarcate the role of insulin signaling in the brain, allowing us to study its link with amyloidogenesis and tau pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. They resorted to a streptozotocin-induced glial-neuronal co-culture model (cells were exposed to 100 µM of the compound for 24 h), in plates, by co-culturing the rat astrocytoma cell line C6 with a neuronal rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12. In parallel, they also developed an in vivo streptozotocin-induced rodent model to extrapolate the results from the in vitro model <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. In the monoculture model, glial cells show a significant increase in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase1 (BACE1) protease, while neurons did not. Meanwhile, in the co-culture model, neurons showed an increase in APP and BACE1 transcripts that actually exceed those found in glia. This result highlights the neuronal vulnerability in the presence of glia. Also in the co-culture model, amyloid-β and BACE1 expression were significantly increased. Related to protein tau, similar results were discovered in the in vivo and in vitro model. Another finding that highlights neuronal vulnerability in the presence of glial cells was the significantly reduced expression of glia-specific GLUT-1 and neuronal GLUT-3 transporters in the co-culture model, but not in the monoculture system. Decreased GLUT-1 expression was related to impairments in glucose uptake in the co-culture, with major changes observed in glia, since insulin signaling is coupled to the glucose uptake in astrocytes. In the animal model, changes in GLUT-1 and 3 were also found, with a significant decrease in the transcripts of both transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>. This suggest that streptozotocin induces insulin signaling dysfunction, a mediator correlated with sporadic AD pathology. More importantly, the co-culture model allowed the drawing of the inference of astrocytes in mediating pathological responses in neuronal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref>.</p><p>In 2017, Spampinato and colleagues created an in vitro BBB co-culture model of human endothelial cells (using the TY10 cell line) and human astrocytes to assess the effect of cell-cell communication in the presence of amyloid-β accumulation in endothelial barrier. Cell cultures were exposed to amyloid-β peptide, namely Aβ1-42 (2 µM for 18 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. They showed that astrocytes can influence amyloid-β effects towards endothelial cells. While TY10 cells in monoculture exposed to amyloid-β peptide showed no differences in dextran permeability, dextran diffusion, accompanied by modifications in the structure of the tight junction claudin-5, were revealed in the co-culture model of TY10 cells with astrocytes. Since amyloid-β exposure was not able to provoke cell death in either endothelial cells or astrocytes, the hypothesis that the sensitivity demonstrated by the endothelial cells could be due to soluble factors released by astrocytes was raised. The authors verified that exposure to the peptide induced the expression of VEGF (VEGF mRNA and protein levels were enhanced). VEGF plays a role in angiogenesis and, furthermore, is released by active astrocytes when stimulated by inflammatory processes. As a result, VEGF induces a down-regulation of tight junctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. In addition, MMP-9 was also found to be increased in endothelial cells in the co-culture model. This finding is supported by others in vitro studies that implicated MMPs in the degradation of BBB tight junctions, whose activity is induced by the presence of amyloid-β peptide. The modification in the barrier function of endothelial cells was prevented upon addition of the non-specific MMPs inhibitor, GM6001, to the co-culture, thus validating the finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. In order to establish the link between astrocyte-derived VEGF and MMP-9 with its implications for altering endothelial permeability, the same experiments were performed, with the amendment of VEGF down-regulation in astrocytes. The findings highlighted an attenuation in the effects caused by VEGF in both the expression of MMP-9 and in the maintenance of the barrier effect. This led the authors to conclude that astrocyte-mediated activity may play an important role in maintaining the barrier provided by endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. In 2019, the same group, resorting to a co-culture model of a human immortalized endothelial cell line (TY10 cells) with human astrocytes, studied the influence of astrocytes regarding leukocyte migration through the BBB in the presence of amyloid-β protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Indeed, the disruption of the BBB in AD is known to increase the permeability of immune cells, responsible for participating in the inflammatory reply. Therefore, the TY10 endothelial cells (monoculture) and the TY10 endothelial cells co-cultured with the human astrocytes were exposed to amyloid-β (2.5 µM), to inflammatory conditions (TNF-α and IFN-γ, 10 U/mL and 5 U/mL, respectively) or to the combination of both, for 5 and 18 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. They showed a significant endothelial cell death in the monoculture model after 5 h under inflammatory conditions (amyloid-β induced cell death after 18 h treatment). In contrast, in the co-culture model, the inflammatory conditions did not induce endothelial cell death after 5 h of treatment, but instead after only 18 h of exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Faced with these results, the co-culture model was used for further studies, with exposure conditions to amyloid-β, inflammatory conditions (TNF-α and IFN-γ) or the combination of both, for 5 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Concerning permeability evaluations, the dextran permeability was significantly enhanced, and both the claudin-5 and VE-cadherin expressions were reduced, in all three exposure conditions. In the monoculture, amyloid-β exposure induced leukocyte migration across the BBB, while no significant changes in leukocyte migration were induced by the inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Additionally, in the co-culture model, the leukocyte migration was only detected under inflammatory conditions. In fact, exposure of mono-and co-culture models to inflammatory conditions for 5 h increased the expression of the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, which is involved in facilitating the transmigration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells through the BBB. Thus, astrocytes play a role in influencing endothelial cell barrier function, which may happen throughout the release of soluble mediators <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref>. Dos Santos Rodrigues and colleagues, in 2019, created an in vitro co-culture model of the BBB (immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line b.End3 co-cultured with primary rat glial and neuronal cells) in order to assess, via transferrin receptor, the targeting and transfection effectiveness of liposomes, designed to evaluate a potential gene therapy for AD that targets the apolipoprotein E2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. The function of the apolipoprotein E, in the CNS, consists of transporting cholesterol from the astrocytes to the neurons. By controlling cholesterol homeostasis, apolipoprotein E contributes to synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. Three polymorphic alleles are described (ε2, 3, and 4), although only the ε2 allele presents neuroprotective functions (implicated in amyloid-β neuronal clearance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. Higher values of TEER were achieved in the co-culture model of endothelial cell line b.END3 with glial cells, when compared to the monoculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. After TEER evaluation, neuronal cells were seeded at the bottom of the well plate. The ability of liposomal formulations to cross the BBB and transfect the primary rat neuronal cells was demonstrated (100 nM of the liposomal formulations and incubation for 8 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. In vivo, in C57BL/6 mice, the accumulation of liposomes within the mice brains increased apolipoprotein E2 protein expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. In conclusion, the co-culture model has proven to be an important improved tool in this study, since it was able to assist in both brain target characterization and translocation of liposomal gene carriers across the BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>. In another study involving apolipoprotein E in AD, Topal and colleagues, in 2020, assessed the endothelial permeability of lipid nanoparticles containing donepezil in a co-culture model of BBB <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. To successfully increase the amount of nanoparticles reaching into the brain, targeting ligands on their surface are usually used. Some peptides and proteins necessary for maintaining normal brain function, namely insulin, transferrin, and lipoproteins, cross the BBB via receptor-mediated transcytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. In association with lipids, apolipoprotein E forms lipoproteins, having high affinity to innumerous low-density lipoprotein-associated receptors (LRPs) and low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs). Since these receptors are abundant in endothelial cells and neurons, apolipoprotein E becomes a good candidate to target ligands to increase drug delivery into the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. To investigate the efficiency of apolipoprotein E-targeting for delivery donepezil across the BBB, the authors developed a co-culture model of primary rat endothelial cells with primary rat astrocytes and pericytes. In parallel, to perform cellular uptake studies, the authors resort to primary rat endothelial cells, hCMEC/D3 cells, and SH-SY5Y cells, differentiated into a more dopaminergic phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. The results showed that the uptake of nanoparticles with the apolipoprotein E targeting ligand was higher than those without it, with higher uptake values detected in primary endothelial cells, followed by hCMEC/D3 cells and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. The permeability assay was performed in the co-culture model and, in addition to TEER measurements, the integrity of the model was also assessed with the evaluation of the permeability values of albumin and sodium fluorescein. The permeability results for both molecules were very low, thus reflecting a good barrier tightness <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>. These results also highlighted a good permeability across the BBB for the targeting nanoparticles. All these results led the authors to conclude that, although further studies in a human BBB model are needed, the targeting nanoparticles can indeed help to increase not only the donepezil crossing into the brain, but also to increase its uptake from neurons, thus increasing drug therapeutic efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref>.</p><p>As an example of the application of co-culture models in the evaluation of the therapeutic potentiality of compounds, in 2018, Alvariño and colleagues assessed the capability of two new amphiphilic glycosylated angucyclinones isolated from Streptomyces sp, streptocyclinones A and B, to attenuate some impairments related to AD. For this purpose, they used a co-culture model of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and BV2 murine microglial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. Regarding the neuronal cell line, after oxidative stress induction with hydrogen peroxide (150 µM for 6 h), the two streptocyclinones reduced the formation of reactive oxygen species. The authors verified that both molecules induced an increase in glutathione levels and the Nrf2 expression in the nucleus, when compared to the control cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. In the microglia cell line, the ability of the compounds to modulate neuroinflammation was also tested, after exposure of BV2 cells to LPS (500 ng/mL for 23 h). Streptocyclinones reduced the release of pro-inflammatory factors and, additionally, induce the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus of microglial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. Following the results that highlighted the neuroprotective role of streptocyclinones, a Transwell co-culture model was assembled (microglial cells were seeded in the inserts above the neuroblastoma cells) to test the protective effect of streptocyclinones on neuronal cell survival rate following LPS-induced microglial cell activation. The viability of neuronal cells increased upon the exposure of BV2 cells to the compounds. Thus, the in vitro assessments allowed the authors to establish a neuroprotective and antioxidant capability for both compounds, by modulating the inflammatory behavior of microglia cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>.</p><p>Knowing that the BBB is a remarkable obstacle for the intracranial delivery of therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, Wasielewska and colleagues developed, in 2022, a sporadic AD BBB model for the ultrasound-mediated delivery of aducanumab and anti-tau antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>. In this context, focused ultrasound combined with microbubbles (FUS +MB ) was used, a novel approach to temporarily disrupt the BBB and enhance drug delivery. From apolipoprotein E gene allele E4 (APOE4, high sporadic AD risk) and allele E3 (APOE3, lower AD risk) carrying patient-derived iPSCs, BBB cells [induced brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs)] and astrocytes (iAstrocytes) were generated to establish monocultures and co-cultures of human sporadic AD and control BBB cells, aiming at assessing the effects of FUS +MB on BBB cell phenotype. These models were also used to screen the delivery of two potentially therapeutic AD antibodies: an Aducanumab analogue (Aduhelm TM ; anti-Aβ antibody) and a novel anti-tau antibody, RNF5 (an anti-tau antibody that effectively reduces p-tau levels in an animal model with tau pathology). Interestingly, a significantly increased delivery (up to 1.73-fold) of RNF5 and Aducanumab analogue was observed across the Transwell-based BBB models upon FUS +MB treatment, when compared to untreated cells. Outstandingly, the obtained results also clearly demonstrated the safety of the FUS +MB approach, as evidenced by minimal alterations in iBEC transcriptome and negligible or no changes in iBEC or iAstrocyte viability and inflammatory responses within the initial 24 h post FUS +MB treatment. In this study, a novel hydrogel-based 2.5D BBB model was also developed as a preliminary step towards a more physiologically relevant FUS +MB drug delivery platform. A successful iBEC barrier formation was observed in the novel 2.5D hydrogel-based BBB model, which led to a significant increase <ref type="bibr">(1.4-fold)</ref> in the delivery of the Aducanumab analogue following FUS +MB treatment. Overall, these results highlighted the successful development of a robust and reproducible in vitro model using patient cells for an efficient FUS+ MB -mediated drug delivery screening. This novel cellbased platform for FUS +MB drug delivery has a remarkable potential in the identification of new FUS +MB -deliverable drugs and for the screening of the specific effects of a FUS +MB approach in control-and patient-derived cells, which could accelerate the use of FUS +MB as a therapeutic approach in AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref>.</p><p>Given that inflammation is a recognized risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, apart from also contributing to its progression, a fully human in vitro BBB model was developed aiming to better understand how inflammation impacts the properties of BMECs, cells that constitute the BBB, which is compromised in AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref>. The developed model featured BMECs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and astrocytic cells obtained from differentiating neural stem cells (NSCs) and aimed to investigate the effects of neuroinflammation on barrier function. To mimic neuroinflammation, cells were exposed to recombinant human TNF-α (10 ng/mL), IL-6 (10 ng/mL), or 10 ng/mL each, for 24 h, either in monoculture or in co-culture. In iPSC-derived BMEC monocultures, the TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines were directly responsible for a dysfunction of the BBB, resulting in an impaired barrier integrity, as evidenced by a decreased TEER value (measure of barrier integrity), an increased permeability of sodium fluorescein (a measure of paracellular permeability), and a decreased cell polarity. Indeed, although the TEER remained unchanged upon exposure to IL-6 alone, a significant reduction by 13% and 16% was observed after exposure to TNF-α and both cytokines, respectively. Furthermore, sodium fluorescein permeability increased by 2-to 2.5-fold upon exposure to the inflammatory cytokines, while the efflux ratio of the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 (ratio between the amount transported out of the brain compartment and the amount transported into the brain compartment) decreased in the presence of the inflammatory cytokines (approximately 40% lower than in the absence of cytokines), evidencing the loss of polarity of BMECs. Overall, all these findings allow to establish a connection between neuroinflammation and specific aspects of BBB integrity impairment. Additionally, either BMECs grown in monoculture or co-cultures of BMECs with NSC-derived astrocytic cells were exposed to TNF-α and IL-6 (10 ng/mL each) and, 24 h later, 25 cytokines and chemokines were quantified in the abluminal media and compared to cultures grown in the absence of the inflammatory cytokines. Increased levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines [namely, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1β), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG)(), and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES)], which are typically secreted by astrocytes or endothelial cells, reached their peak during inflammatory conditions in the presence of NSC-astrocytic cells. Outstandingly, and despite the presence of several proinflammatory cytokines known to impair the BBB function, NSC-derived astrocytic cells were able to counteract the effects of inflammation, as evidenced by the restoration of TEER values and IgG permeability (a second measure of barrier integrity). Furthermore, these findings also indicate that, in neuroinflammation, a breakdown in transcellular transport seems to occur before an impairment in paracellular permeability. The developed co-culture model effectively replicated the cellular responses to inflammation at the BBB and may represent a useful platform for studying the contributions of individual cell types to disease progression. Furthermore, these findings also suggest that BBB proper functioning may be influenced by a delicate balance of soluble factors, underscoring the intricate nature of inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref>.</p><p>Microglia, as brain-resident macrophages, play crucial roles in maintaining homeostasis and create a supportive environment for neurons. Furthermore, microglia are increasingly recognized as playing a significant role in brain pathology, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD, and motor neuron diseases (MND), with numerous genes associated with these conditions being expressed in microglia. As such, there is a critical need for authentic and efficient in vitro models to investigate the pathological mechanisms of human microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>. To accomplish with this need, Haenseler and colleagues developed, in 2017, an iPSC microglia co-culture model with iPSC cortical neurons. In the developed co-cultures, the neuronal maturity and functionality were retained for extended periods. Furthermore, microglia in co-culture expressed essential microglia-specific markers (namely, MERTK, GPR34, PROS1, C1QA, GAS6, and P2RY12), as well as genes relevant for major neurodegenerative diseases [namely, AD-related genes (APP, PICALM, and CD33); PD-related genes (PARK15, PINK1, SNCA, and DJ-1); and MND/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-related genes (C9orf72, TDP43, and SOD1)], suggesting that the developed co-culture model could be useful to investigate the effects of several genes associated with highly debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, iPSC-derived microglia in co-culture also exhibit highly dynamic ramifications and demonstrate phagocytic activity. Overall, given the increasing evidence of the implications of microglia in distinct neurodegenerative diseases, the developed iPSC-derived microglia model, by expressing key genes involved in AD, PD, and MND, could represent a useful tool for the study of the corresponding gene products within an authentic human in vitro system. Noteworthy, some of these disease-relevant genes can be studied in microglia either in monoculture or in co-culture conditions, being the developed co-culture conditions especially important for genes where the crosstalk between microglia and neurons is essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>.</p></div>

The cause of death is usually respiratory failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">168]</ref>. The pathology of this disease also involves cell death dysregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>.</p><p>Smethurst and colleagues, in 2020, based on a pathological finding for this disease, the aberrant cytoplasmic localization and aggregation of TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in motor neurons and glia (in both brain and spinal cord of patients), performed an in vitro assay to further analyze TDP-43 toxicity in cells and to try to understand the role of astrocytes in ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>. They used a co-culture model of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons and astrocytes to modeling cell-specific characteristics of sporadic ALS. For TDP-43 seeding aggregation it was used serially passaged ALS spinal cord extract <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>. In the monoculture model of derived motor neurons, the researchers have noticed, after treatment with seeding aggregation, a lack of toxicity, accompanied with low frequency and abundance of TDP-43. Meanwhile, combined seeded aggregation with proteasomal inhibition significantly increased the number of aggregates and activated caspase-3. This finding suggested that TDP-43 seeded aggregation is toxic only under defined cellular conditions. In the co-culture model, TDP-43 was toxic to neurons but not to astrocytes. In addition, astrocytes demonstrated a neuroprotective role by reducing TDP-43 aggregation and toxicity in neurons. This model supports the clinical relevance of the protein-mediated toxicity hypothesis in ALS, raising the importance of astrocytes in this disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref>.</p><p>Another study highlighting the importance of cell-cell communications between astrocytes and neurons was conducted by <ref type="bibr">Paul and Belleroche, in 2014 [169]</ref>. D-serine (a co-agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) levels are elevated in sporadic ALS and a pathogenic mutation on the enzyme responsible for degrading D-serine, D-amino acid oxidase, co-segregates with familial ALS. The pathogenic mutation R199w in D-amino acid oxidase severally impairs enzyme activity, stimulating toxic effects in motor neu-rons, resulting in apoptosis. Based on these findings, the authors used a motor neuron cell line, NSC-34 cells, and the C6 glioma cell line in both monoculture and co-culture (Transwell system) to analyze the toxicity mechanism of the mutant protein and the interactions between both cells <ref type="bibr">[169]</ref>. Monocultures of C6 cells expressing wild-type or R199w-D-amino acid oxidase mutation showed low levels of apoptosis. In a co-culture model of a C6 cell expressing the mutant version of D-amino acid oxidase, NSC-34 cells experienced an increased staining for the apoptotic marker annexin-v, when compared to the co-culture containing C6 cells expressing the wild type version of D-amino acid oxidase. This suggested that a dysfunction in D-serine metabolism may cause a release of some component(s) from glial cells that regulates neuronal viability. Blocking of the glycine/D-serine binding site at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor with the selective antagonist 5,7-dichloro-4-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid (DCKA) significantly attenuated the neuronal apoptosis caused by the mutant version of D-amino acid oxidase <ref type="bibr">[169]</ref>. In conclusion, the authors showed that elevated levels of D-serine play a role in motor neuron degeneration and highlighted the importance of cross-talk between cells in disease pathology <ref type="bibr">[169]</ref>.</p><p>To better understand the disease physiology, Veyrat-Durebex and colleagues, in 2016, developed an in vitro model of ALS, using a Transwell system, resorting to a motor neuron-like cell line, NSC-34 cells, co-cultured with the astrocyte clone C8-D1A. Both cell types were over-expressing the human wild-type or G93C mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>. The analysis focused on the role of SOD-1 mutation and oxidative stress (induced by 10 µM of menadione) on intracellular metabolism, both implicated in ALS pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>. Under oxidative stress, metabolomic analysis showed alterations in glycine, succinate, malate, and glutamate concentrations in the model over-expressing mutant SOD-1. This suggests a disruption in tricarboxylic acid cycle, in excitatory neurotransmission and in glutathione synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>. The implications of the impairment of these metabolic pathways are related to excitotoxicity and dysfunction in mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, both involved in neuronal injury. These findings are consistent with prior research in ALS. Therefore, the co-culture model shows to be a well-designed and useful model, allowing the assessment of the consequences of oxidative stress on energetic metabolism in ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref>.</p><p>Lee and colleagues, in 2017, used a co-culture model of b.END3 cells with primary mice astrocytes to assess the influence of endothelial cells on the expression of glutamate transporter, GLT-1 by astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>. GLT-1 is a sodium-dependent transporter, responsible for glutamate clearance that shows a reduced expression in postmortem samples of ALS patients. They showed that the presence of endothelial cells in the co-culture model increased GLT-1 expression by astrocytes, as compared to astrocytes in monoculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>. This effect was attenuated by γ-secretase inhibition with DAPT (10 µM) and by knockingdown the notch effector, RBPJ. This indicates that notch signaling, which occurs as a result of cell contact, is pivotal to generate an up-regulation of astrocytic GLT-1 by endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>.</p><p>Mohamed and colleagues, in 2019, studied the influence of glutamate release by the astrocytes in promoting P-gp expression in endothelial cells, and its consequence in ALS by reducing the CNS penetration and efficacy of the ALS drug riluzole <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>. The authors developed an in vitro human BBB model by co-culturing patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into endothelial cells with astrocytes differentiated from patientderived induced pluripotent stem cells of SOD1-A4V or C9orf72 genotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>. They showed that endothelial cells exposed to the conditioned media from SOD1-A4V-derived astrocytes presented an increased expression and activity of P-gp, via NMDA receptor activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>. In contrast, exposure to conditioned media from C9orf72 astrocytes did not produce the same result, which may indicate that this phenomenon is not shared by all forms of ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>. COX2 inhibition is suggested as a promising therapeutic target in overcoming glutamate-mediated P-gp upregulation in epilepsy and PD animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>. Based on this, they next blocked the NMDA receptors and COX2 with MK801 and celecoxib, respectively. Both inhibitors significantly diminished P-gp expression in endothelial cells exposed to the conditioned media from SOD1-A4V-derived astrocytes. They concluded that glutamate released by SOD1-A4V and sporadic ALS astrocytes mediated P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells of the BBB and revealed possible new targets for ALS treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">[172]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.3.">Parkinson's Disease</head><p>Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder mostly characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>.</p><p>As previously mentioned, SH-SY5Y cells are capable of being differentiated into a dopaminergic phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. Therefore, this neuroblastoma cell line is a widely used model for PD research. There are two main strategies used to induce the disease phenotype, including drug treatment and/or genetic approaches. The compounds used for this purpose, based on drug-induced phenotype, are the MPP+ (toxic metabolite formed from its precursor MPTP, a product used in the synthesis of a synthetic analog of heroin, responsible for causing severe Parkinsonism in humans); 6-hydroxydopamine (catecholaminergic neurotoxin), and rotenone (highly lipophilic insecticide). The mechanism by which these compounds induce neurotoxicity mainly involves mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. In a recent work, using a 3D scaffold, Chemmarappally and colleagues, in 2020, developed a co-culture system of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line (differentiated into a more mature dopaminergic phenotype with retinoic acid and B27 supplement), with the astrocytic cell line (U-87MG human glioblastoma cell line) <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>. Indeed, neurons and astrocyte-based cell models have been used in neurodegenerative diseases and CNS disorders studies, since astrocytes have been involved in neuroprotection by releasing antioxidant molecules and neurotrophic factors (neurons can use the antioxidants released by astrocytes to reduce the oxidative conditions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">174]</ref>. Neuronal cells showed an improved survival rate when co-cultured with astrocytes in the 3D scaffolds, after challenging the system with rotenone, MPTP, MG132 (induces proteasome inhibition) and BSO (glutamyl-cysteine synthetase inhibitor) <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>. Furthermore, when compared to 2D or even 3D monoculture models, the developed model has the advantage of allowing the neuronal cells to communicate more naturally with neighboring cells, providing a protective effect. Thus, the authors concluded that scaffolds could be an improvement to the models used for drug discovery in PD, as well as in studies related to disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref>.</p><p>In 2015, Efremova and colleagues created a co-culture model of human dopaminergic neurons (using LUHMES cells, conditionally immortalized mesencephalic neuronal precursors) and astrocytes (immortalized mouse astrocyte cell line, IMA 2.1) to assess the neuroprotective role of several compounds against the neurotoxin MPTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. Astrocytes are responsible to convert MPTP into its toxic metabolite MPP+. In fact, conversion of MPTP requires monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, mainly found in astrocytes. Therefore, taking advantage of the fact that the astrocytic cell line was used to create the in vitro model, they also analyzed possible differences to the direct use of MPP+ in in vitro models, which omit the influence of glial cells in the process <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. The co-culture model recapitulated the in vivo conversion of MPTP into MPP+ and its inherent neurotoxicity. In a time-dependent manner, a decrease in MPTP levels in the supernatant was verified, accompanied by the formation of MPP+, reaching saturation levels after 24 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. Co-cultures treated with MPTP (30 µM) for 5 days revealed a noticeable neuronal loss, as detected by β-III-tubulin staining. For pharmacological evaluations, authors compared the MPP+ model (monoculture of the neuronal cell line) and the MPTP model (co-culture). DAT blockage with GBR12909 showed a neuroprotective role in both models, while MAO-B inhibition with L-deprenyl only prevented the toxicity of MPTP in the co-culture model. These results support the data from in vivo studies, demonstrating that MPTP is converted by MAO into MPP+ in astrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. In In general, the experimental neuroprotectors tested revealed to be more effective in the monoculture model compared to the co-culture system. To explain these differences, the authors formulated the following hypothesis: (i) some of the compounds used might be metabolized by astrocytes; (ii) the presence of astrocytes could affect the metabolic ability of neurons; (iii) astrocytes might also have contributed to alter the cell death mechanisms; (iv) the continuous conversion of MPTP into MPP+ by astrocytes could have contributed to an early stress response or adaptations <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. Overall, the pharmacological experiments revealed that the MPTP co-culture model represents a valid model of degeneration of human dopaminergic neurons, capable of replicating crucial aspects of its toxicity in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[173]</ref>. Most importantly, the co-culture model was able to elucidate the pharmacological differences found between the models, due to their different complexities.</p><p>In 2021, Sergi and colleagues assessed the potential anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory role of the polyphenol trans-ε-viniferin (a dimer of resveratrol) in a co-culture model combining the rat pheochromocytoma neuronal cell line, PC12, and the microglial cell line N9. To mimic the PD phenotype they resorted to the compound 6-hydroxydopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref>. To study the impact of LPS-activated microglia on the survival rate of the neuronal cells, cells were co-cultured in a non-contact model. They showed that trans-ε-viniferin attenuated the activation of the apoptotic cascade induced by 6-hydroxydopamine in neurons and the neurotoxicity induced by LPS-activated microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[175]</ref>.</p><p>Johnson et al. performed an in vitro study to assess if others bioactive compounds of mucuna seeds (Mucuna pruriens), a well-established natural source of levodopa, may exert some biological effect in mitigating the symptoms of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. For that, the authors prepared an extract of mucuna seeds containing a low concentration of levodopa and tested the effects on murine BV-2 microglia cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, individually and in a non-contact co-culture model <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. In the BV-2 cells, in monoculture, the extract of mucuna seeds reduced the hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity, the formation of reactive oxygen species and the LPS-induced nitric oxide species release. In the neuroblastoma cells, the extract was able to reduce the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. In co-culture, exposure of LPS-activated BV-2 cells to the extract of mucuna seeds prevented apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>. This suggests that mucuna seeds have other bioactive compounds, besides levodopa, with neuroprotective potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[176]</ref>.</p><p>In 2016, Kuan and colleagues analyzed the influence of α-synuclein aggregation, a protein with innate neurotoxicity and a pathological hallmark in PD, on endothelial cells barrier function, using two co-culture models: (i) hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with primary rat astrocytes and (ii) hCMEC/D3 cells co-cultured with primary neuronal cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. Models were exposed to α-synuclein preformed fibrils (0,1 µg/µL, 14 days) to evaluate functional, molecular, and cellular changes. They showed a significant downregulation of ZO-1 and occludin expression by α-synuclein preformed fibrils <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. Nonetheless, these changes in the protein expression did not significantly change TEER or permeability values. One explanation for this may lies in the compensation provided by claudin-5, another junctional protein that limits the paracellular crossing <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>. Thus, by using these models, the authors established a link between α-synuclein aggregation and the impaired inexpression of tight junction proteins, which may contribute to disease pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[177]</ref>.</p><p>In another study involving α-synuclein, Dohgu and colleagues, in 2019, compared an in vitro monoculture model of rat endothelial cells with a co-culture model of rat endothelial cells and rat pericytes, to study the influence of pericyte-derived inflammatory mediators on BBB disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref>. Exposure to α-synuclein (50 µg/mL, for 24 h) induced a considerable increase in endothelial permeability to sodium fluorescein in the co-culture model, only when added to the abluminal side containing pericytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref>. In addition, αsynuclein exposure triggered IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α, and MMP-9 release by pericytes, which caused the deregulation of the BBB barrier function. This study elucidated a role for pericytes, in response to α-synuclein, in inducing endothelial barrier dysfunction, via inflammatory mediators <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[178]</ref>.</p><p>Matsumoto and colleagues, in 2012, used a co-culture model of primary rat endothelial cells and primary rat microglia cells to investigate the effect of LPS-activated microglia on P-gp expression and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. A decline in P-gp activity is observed in patients with neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. In addition, microglia release proinflammatory mediators that interfere with BBB function, including the integrity of tight junction and efflux transporters' activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. The monoculture model of rat endothelial cells was compared to the co-culture model of rat endothelial cells with rat microglia in terms of rhodamine 123 intracellular accumulation, after microglia activation with LPS (1 ng/mL added to the abluminal side for 6 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. In the monoculture, no significant effects were detected on rhodamine 123 accumulation. Meanwhile, in the co-culture system, LPS substantially increased rhodamine 123 intracellular accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>. The addition of diphenyleneiodoniumchloride (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase in microglia, reduced the accumulation of rhodamine 123 within the endothelial cells induced by LPSactivated microglia. This indicates that LPS-activated microglia cause the dysfunction of P-gp activity in endothelial cells, via NADPH oxidase, which may constitute a potential target in neuro-inflammatory diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[179]</ref>.</p><p>Liu and colleagues, in 2014, evaluated the limitation imposed by P-gp to the BBB crossing of the new drug candidate for PD treatment, FLZ (N-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)ethyl]-2-(2,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-acrylamide) <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>. They developed two in vitro models, designed to perform permeability studies in a normal and pathological BBB, by co-culturing: (i) normal physiological rat brain endothelial cells with C6 astrocytic cells and (ii) rat endothelial cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (2 µg/mL), with C6 astrocytic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>. Co-culture of brain endothelial cells with astrocytes improved TEER values and the expression of efflux transporters, namely P-gp. The diffusion of FLZ (1, 5, 10 µM) across the normal and pathological model of the BBB occurred in both apical-basolateral and basolateral-apical directions. However, the basolateral-apical flux was considerably higher than that in the apical-basolateral direction, thus suggesting the presence of efflux pumps <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>. In addition, FLZ revealed a higher efflux ratio in the pathological model. P-gp inhibition with zosuquidar (5 µM) inhibited FLZ efflux, resulting in an intracellular accumulation of FLZ in rat endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>. In contrast, BCRP inhibition with FTC (10 µM) did not significantly change the intracellular accumulation of FLZ. These results indicated that the low permeability of the FLZ into the brain is due to P-gp efflux activity, limiting its brain intracellular accumulation. They also highlight that normal and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rat brain endothelial cells represent good systems to study, in vitro, the BBB function under physiological and pathological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[180]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, the emergence of iPSC technology allowed several researchers to investigate PD using distinct iPSC models of the disease, particularly with human iPSCderived neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[181,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">182]</ref>. Apart from differentiating iPSCs into dopaminergic neurons, significant progress has also been achieved in the differentiation of iPSCs into other CNS resident cells, such as astrocytes and microglia-like cells, which facilitate disease modeling through heterotopic 2D cell-cell interaction models <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[182]</ref>.</p><p>In the field of neurodegenerative diseases' research, in particular in PD, several coculture models have been developed using iPSC-derived cells, including co-cultures of iPSC-derived cortical neurons with iPSC-derived microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref>, and co-cultures of human iPSC-derived astrocytes with microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183]</ref>. Indeed, and interestingly, Rostami and colleagues, in 2021, developed a co-culture model of human iPSC-derived astrocytes and microglia, which were exposed to preformed fibrils of α-synuclein (0.5 µM) or Aβ (0.2 µM), for 24 h, 4 days, or 7 days, and the results compared to those obtained for the monocultures of either cell type. When in monoculture, both microglia and astrocytes were capable of internalizing α-synuclein and Aβ aggregates, although microglia demonstrated to be more efficient in degrading the protein aggregates. When in co-culture, despite both cell types internalizing α-synuclein and Aβ fibrils, microglia exhibited a higher uptake of the aggregates. Outstandingly, when in co-culture, a decreased accumulation of intracellular deposits of α-synuclein and Aβ was depicted in astrocytes, when compared to the monocultures. Moreover, it was demonstrated that when in co-culture, astrocytes and microglia maintained continuous communication through tunneling nanotubes and other membrane structures. By live cell imaging, it was observed that microglia, upon adhering to the cell membrane of an astrocyte, could attract and eliminate intracellular protein deposits from the astrocyte. Therefore, this dynamic interaction between these two cell types promoted the transfer of protein aggregates from astrocytes to microglia, thus potentially representing a crucial mechanism for the clearance of protein aggregates within the affected brains. Overall, the collected data underscore a synergistic effect of astrocytes and microglia in processing Aβ and α-synuclein aggregates, emphasizing the significance of microglia and astrocyte interactions in the clearance of protein aggregates and, consequently, the importance of the glial cellular crosstalk in PD or even AD progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[183]</ref>.</p><p>However, studies on the use of co-culture models for modelling PD using iPSC-derived BMECs are fairly scarce. For example, the previously described accelerated differentiation method developed by Hollman and colleagues, in 2017, for obtaining BMECs from iPSCs, was also found to ensure the long-term stability of BMECs containing biallelic PARK2 mutations linked to PD. Indeed, using the E6 medium, an iPSC line SM14, derived from a preclinical PD patient with compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 linked to familial early-onset PD, was successfully differentiated into BMECs. However, although control iPSC-derived BMECs were tested in co-culture with both iPSC-derived astrocytes and primary human brain pericytes, the same was not performed for BMECs containing the biallelic PARK2 mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>.</p><p>Knowing that BBB dysfunction is clearly associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly at late stages, and aiming at elucidating the impact of several mutations associated with familial neurodegenerative disorders on BBB function and their potential to induce BBB impairment, Katt and colleagues, in 2019, used iPSCs from three healthy individuals and eight individuals with neurodegenerative diseases [two from PD patients, two from ALS patients, two from AD patients, and two from Huntington's disease (HD) patients) and differentiated them into BMECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[184]</ref>. The characteristics and barrier function of confluent monolayer human iPSC-derived BMECs were then assessed, namely TEER values and solute permeability (lucifer yellow, d-glucose, and rhodamine 123 permeabilities), the expression of BBB biomarkers at the mRNA and protein levels, as well as the P-gp efflux activity (rhodamine 123 efflux ratio and the effect of tariquidarmediated P-gp inhibition). All iPSC-derived BMECs (obtained from healthy and disease iPSCs) expressed several BBB-associated markers, at both mRNA and protein levels, namely the tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-5, and ZO-1, as well as P-gp. TEER values obtained from healthy controls ranged between 1800 and 2500 Ω•cm 2 , while significantly decreased TEER values were obtained for the two ALS lines, and one of the PD, AD, and HD lines (TEER values ranging from 500 to 1000 Ω•cm 2 ). Even though the TEER values obtained for the disease iPSCs-derived BMECs were fairly below the physiological values observed in animal models (1500-8000 Ω•cm 2 ), they were relatively high when compared to those obtained for several primary and immortalized cells. The normal barrier function and restricted paracellular transport, evaluated through the assessment of lucifer yellow permeability, was confirmed for all the iPSC-derived BMECs, except for one AD (PSEN1 A246E) and one HD (HTT CAG:50) line, for which a small, but significant, decrease in barrier function was observed. The permeability of d-glucose, a measure of the GLUT1 activity, was significantly decreased in two of the tested disease iPSC-derived BMECs, and in one PD (SCNA1 triplication) and another ASL (C9orf72 expansion) model, when compared to heathy BMECs. Concerning P-gp, a reduced activity or incorrect polarization was suggested to occur for all disease lines, except SOD4AV (ALS), as evidenced by a rhodamine 123 efflux ratio smaller than 1, when compared to efflux ratios of 2-4 obtained for the three healthy control lines (the effectiveness of P-gp efflux activity is measured through the efflux ratio of the basolateral-to-apical and apical-to-basolateral permeabilities, and for P-gp substrates, the obtained value should be greater than 1.0). Upon tariquidarmediated P-gp inhibition, a reduction in rhodamine 123 efflux ratio was observed for many of the tested iPSC-derived BMECs, although this effect was only significant for the healthy controls. Overall, the obtained data support the hypothesis that mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases can independently induce BBB dysfunction, further suggesting that the accumulation of defects in BMECs may ultimately lead to BBB impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[184]</ref>.</p><p>Astrocytes are vital elements of the neurovascular unit, providing support for a proper BBB functioning, and their pathological transition to reactive states can have both protective and detrimental effects on BBB function <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref>. In fact, although inflammation triggered by microglia is clearly linked to neurodegeneration, inflammation associated with reactive astrocytes may also be significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref>, as demonstrated by the neuroprotective effect of inhibiting inflammatory astrocyte conversion in mouse models of ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[186]</ref> and PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[187]</ref>. With that in mind, and knowing that the inflammation of brain endothelial cells is observed in both aging and neurodegenerative conditions, Kim and colleagues developed, in 2022, an iPSC-derived BBB co-culture model (iPSC-derived BMEC-like cells co-cultured with iPSCs-derived astrocytes) aiming to investigate the impact of astrocytes on BBB function. It was demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced the conversion of astrocytes into an inflammatory reactive state, which lead to BBB dysfunction, as clearly demonstrated through the loss of passive barrier function and by the upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Moreover, BBB dysfunction relied on the activation of STAT3, a signaling pathway that is well established to mediate astrocyte reactivity in animal models. The activation of STAT3 signaling also pointed as a central axis for a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes in CNS disorders. Furthermore, SERPINA3 [encoding alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (α1ACT)], which showed increased expression, was identified as a candidate astrocyte factor causing the observed BBB disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[185]</ref>. Overall, the obtained data clearly demonstrated that the developed iPSC-derived cell co-culture model can be successfully applied for the in vitro evaluation of the impact of astrocytes in BBB disruption over the course of disease, namely the implication of the inflammation associated with reactive astrocytes in BBB dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Concluding Remarks</head><p>The BBB is a complex cellular barrier formed by endothelial cells under the influence of different cell types that together give life to the so-called "neurovascular unit". The BBB is responsible for protecting the brain from potentially toxic agents (both endobiotics and xenobiotics) and pathogens present in the blood circulation, while providing it with the optimal energetic and nutritional conditions for normal functioning. Its barrier status is due to several characteristics that make it unique, particularly the lipid nature of its membrane and the tight junction proteins that limit the permeability of hydrophilic compounds; the presence of SLC and ABC transporters that regulate the transcellular transport of nutrients, substrates and unwanted products, and also the presence of specific mechanisms that regulate the entry of required proteins and peptides; the presence of enzymes (e.g., CYP450) that give it additional metabolic protection and its ability to regulate the CNS immune defenses.</p><p>Since endothelial cells were first successfully isolated from brain microvessels, several useful models have been developed, although with limitations inherent to their origin, isolation, and immortalization process. Cell culture-based models have allowed the expansion of knowledge on the pathophysiology of the BBB, providing an excellent alternative to the limited means of in vivo studies and an excellent tool in neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration, and new CNS drug research. The development of more realistic in vitro models that can recapitulate the complexity and dynamics of the BBB has driven over the past few years' changes in the field of BBB modeling, with the introduction of new technologies and methods to improve the existing models and to create new ones. The switch to multicellular models encompassing several cell types of the neurovascular unit, mainly astrocytes and pericytes, in culture with endothelial cells was an important breakthrough in bringing the characteristics of the models closer to those of the human BBB phenotype.</p><p>Given its complexity, this barrier stands as a real challenge to researchers and the fact that its true phenotype is far from being completely known, makes it difficult to create an ideal model. More recently, stem cell studies aimed at establishing a functional and reliable model, and 3D technology, which have been advancing rapidly and gaining some popularity by being used in BBB model engineering, mark the future perspectives.</p><p>These most recent efforts reinforce that, despite all the shortcomings encountered and the gaps that remain to be fulfilled about this dynamic barrier, the ongoing pursuit of the ideal in vitro model to expand the portfolio concerning the many aspects related to the BBB continues. The creation of in vitro models, using cell cultures that are increasingly reliable and realistic of their complex properties becomes imperative. This priority takes on special emphasis in studies related to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and, nonetheless, in the development of new drugs that target the CNS.</p><p>Over the past few years, several studies have elucidated the importance of cell-cell communication for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases, especially in the most prevalent ones, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. This may facilitate not only the discovery of new therapeutic targets, but also to generate better outcomes regarding toxicological assays.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Table <ref type="table">31</ref> compiles the advantages of co-culturing stem cells with astrocytes, pericytes, and neurons.</p><p>In 2017, Wang and colleagues developed a microfluidic BBB model to mimic the in vivo-like barrier properties for drug permeability screening. For that purpose, human iPSCs-derived BMECs were co-cultured with rat primary astrocytes on the two sides of a porous membrane on a pumpless microfluidic platform for up to 10 days. The developed BBB-on-a-chip model demonstrated a significant barrier integrity, as evidenced by continuous tight junction formation and in vivo-like values of TEER. Indeed, the TEER levels peaked above 4000 Ω•cm 2 on day 3 on the chip and were sustained above 2000 Ω•cm 2 for up to 10 days (demonstrating highly sustained TEER values). The suitability of the developed microfluidic BBB model to be applied in drug permeability studies was also assessed by using model drugs, such as cimetidine, caffeine, and doxorubicin, as well as large molecules (FITC-dextrans). The obtained permeability coefficients were similar to those obtained in in vivo studies. Overall, the developed BBB-on-a-chip model closely mimics physiological BBB functions for a prolonged period and may represent a valuable tool for the in vitro screening of drug permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[124]</ref>.</p><p>Delsing and colleagues developed, in 2018, a human iPSC-derived model of the BBB that included iPSC-derived endothelial cells in co-culture with iPSC-derived pericytes, astrocytes and neurons. Such endothelial cells present in the co-culture model exhibited high TEER values (significantly increased in the co-culture compared to the monoculture for iPSC-derived endothelial cells), functional P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux (evaluated </p></div>
