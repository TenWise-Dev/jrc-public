TI  - Infiltration of T Cells into a Three-Dimensional Psoriatic Skin Model Mimics 
      Pathological Key Features.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20071670 [doi]

AB  - Psoriasis is an autoimmune chronic dermatosis that is T cell-mediated, 
      characterized by epidermal thickening, aberrant epidermal differentiation and 
      inflammatory infiltrates, with a dominant Th1 and Th17 profile. Additional in 
      vitro models are required to study the complex interactions between activated T 
      cells and skin cells, and to develop new, more effective treatments. We have 
      therefore sought to model this psoriatic inflammation by the generation of 
      tissue-engineered immunocompetent tissues, and we have investigated the response 
      of activated T-cell infiltration in models produced with lesional psoriatic skin 
      cells on major hallmarks of psoriasis. The immunocompetent lesional skin model 
      displayed a delayed onset of epidermal differentiation, an hyperproliferation of 
      the basal keratinocytes, a drastic increase in the secretion of proinflammatory 
      cytokines, and a disturbed expression of key transcription factors, as observed 
      in lesional plaques, suggesting a crucial importance of combining the 
      pathological phenotype of cutaneous cells to T cells in order to generate a 
      relevant model for psoriasis. Finally, we found this skin model to be responsive 
      to methotrexate treatment, making it a valuable tool for drug development.

AB  - The full human skin organ culture (HSOC) model is a standardized test system for 
      evaluating pharmacological substances on human skin in vitro. The acantholysis 
      associated with pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a severe and potentially 
      life-threatening autoimmune skin blistering disease, can be induced in HSOC by 
      injecting a bi-specific anti-desmoglein (dsg) 1 and 3 single-chain antibody 
      variable fragment (scFv). Compared to cell culture experiments (e.g., induction 
      of dsg3-internalization or keratinocyte dissociation using HaCaT cells or normal 
      human epidermal keratinocytes) the HSOC model is more sophisticated and 
      physiologically relevant. In this model, all three layers of the human skin are 
      present, all cells are sustained in their physiological niche and orientation, 
      and the cell-cell-contacts remain intact. Here we describe a protocol for HSOC, 
      an ex vivo model of human skin, that has proved to be well-established and 
      informative in our laboratory. (c) 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Thymic epithelial cells are one of the main components of the thymic 
      microenvironment required for T-cell development. In this work, we describe an 
      efficient method free of enzymatic and Facs-sorted methods to culture human 
      medullary thymic epithelial cells without affecting the cell phenotypic, 
      physiologic and functional features. Human medulla thymic epithelial cells 
      (mTECs) are obtained by culturing thymic biopsies explants. After 7 days of 
      primo-culture, mTECs keep their ability to express key molecules involved in 
      immune tolerance processes such as autoimmune regulator, tissue-specific 
      antigens, chemokines, and cytokines. In addition, the cells sensor their cultured 
      environment and consequently adjust their gene expression network. Therefore, we 
      describe and provide a human mTEC model that may be used to test the effect of 
      various molecules on thymic epithelial cell homeostasis and physiology. This 
      method should allow the investigations of the specificities and the knowledge of 
      human mTECs in normal or pathological conditions and therefore discontinue the 
      extrapolations done on the murine models.

AB  - Human cell-based 3D tissue constructs play an increasing role in disease modeling 
      and drug screening. Inflammation, atherosclerosis, and many autoimmune disorders 
      involve the interactions between immune cells and blood vessels. However, it has 
      been difficult to image and model these interactions under realistic conditions. 
      In this study, we fabricated a perfusion and imaging chamber to allow the 
      real-time visualization of leukocyte perfusion, adhesion, and migration inside a 
      tissue-engineered blood vessel (TEBV). We monitored the elevated monocyte 
      adhesion to the TEBV wall and transendothelial migration (TEM) as the TEBV 
      endothelium was activated by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. We demonstrated 
      that treatment with anti-TNF-alpha or an NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitor would 
      attenuate the endothelium activation and reduce the number of leukocyte adhesion 
      (>74%) and TEM events (>87%) close to the control. As the first demonstration of 
      real-time imaging of dynamic cellular events within a TEBV, this work paves the 
      way for drug screening and disease modeling in TEBV-associated microphysiological 
      systems.

TI  - Sinomenine inhibits the inflammatory responses of human fibroblast-like 
      synoviocytes via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 355-360
LID - 10.1691/ph.2017.6946 [doi]
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disorder mainly characterized 
      by inflammation of the synovial tissue that can lead to destruction of bone and 
      cartilage. Sinomenine is an alkaloid extracted from the stem of the Chinese 
      medicinal plant Sinomenium acutum. It has been reported that sinomenine has 
      immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the molecular 
      mechanism underlying the effect of sinominine on IL-1beta-induced human RA 
      fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLS) is poorly understood. Therefore, in this 
      study, we investigated the effect of sinomenine on the expression of inflammatory 
      cytokines in IL-1beta-treated human RAFLS in vitro and the underlying mechanism. 
      RAFLS viability was evaluated using the MTS assay after sinomenine treatment. The 
      levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured with ELISA, RT-PCR and western 
      blot, respectively. The levels of TLR4 and its downstream signaling targets were 
      determined by western blot analysis. We found that sinomenine suppressed not only 
      NO and PGE2 production but also iNOS and COX-2 expression in IL-1beta-induced RAFLS. 
      It also inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in IL-1beta-stimulated RAFLS. 
      Furthermore, sinomenine prevented IL-1beta-induced TLR4, MyD88 and p-NF-kappaB p65 
      expression. Taken together, these results demonstrated that sinomenine prevented 
      IL-1beta-induced inflammation in human RAFLS at least in part by inhibiting the 
      TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, suggesting that sinomenine could be a 
      potential agent in the treatment of RA.

TI  - Monocytes enhance neutrophil-induced blister formation in an ex vivo model of 
      bullous pemphigoid.
PG  - 1119-1130
LID - 10.1111/all.13376 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lesions of bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune subepidermal 
      blistering disease characterized by the presence of tissue-bound and circulating 
      autoantibodies to hemidesmosomal antigens, harbor a mixed inflammatory cellular 
      infiltrate. In various models, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, monocytes as 
      well as B and T cells have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of BP. 
      However, their interactions with and effective role in blister formation remain 
      uncertain. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of 
      monocyte/neutrophil interaction on blister formation in an ex vivo BP model. 
      METHODS: Skin cryosections were incubated with purified human neutrophils and 
      monocytes, in the presence or absence of BP autoantibodies. Production of 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulation, mediator release (neutrophil 
      elastase [NE], myeloperoxidase [MPO], matrix metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9]), 
      binding of Fcgamma receptor (CD16, CD32, CD64), and cell adhesion (CD18, ICAM-1) was 
      investigated using appropriate inhibitors. Dermal-epidermal separation (DES) was 
      assessed by light microscopy and quantified by Fiji software. RESULTS: Monocytes 
      and neutrophils synergistically interact resulting in a significantly higher DES 
      compared to either monocytes or neutrophils separately (P < .0001). 
      Monocyte/neutrophil-induced DES was associated with increased ROS production and 
      was dependent on adhesion and FcgammaRIII binding. Upon stimulation by the 
      granule-poor fraction of monocyte supernatants, neutrophils increased their 
      release of MMP-9, thereby also DES at the dermal-epidermal junction of skin 
      cryosections. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that the interaction of cells, 
      as shown here for monocytes and neutrophils, enhances mediator release resulting 
      in an increased subepidermal blister formation. Thus, blocking intercellular 
      cross talk promises a new therapeutic approach for blocking tissue damage in BP.

TI  - Analysing the dynamics of a model for alopecia areata as an autoimmune disorder 
      of hair follicle cycling.
PG  - 387-407
LID - 10.1093/imammb/dqx009 [doi]
AB  - Alopecia areata (AA) is a CD8$;+$ T cell-dependent autoimmune disease that 
      disrupts the constantly repeating cyclic transformations of hair follicles (HFs). 
      Among the three main HF cycle stages-growth (anagen), regression (catagen) and 
      relative quiescence (telogen)-only anagen HFs are attacked and thereby forced to 
      prematurely enter into catagen, thus shortening active hair growth substantially. 
      After having previously modelled the dynamics of immune system components 
      critically involved in the disease development (Dobreva et al., 2015), we here 
      present a mathematical model for AA which incorporates HF cycling and illustrates 
      the anagen phase interruption in AA resulting from an inflammatory autoimmune 
      response against HFs. The model couples a system describing the dynamics of 
      autoreactive immune cells with equations modelling the hair cycle. We illustrate 
      states of health, disease and treatment as well as transitions between them. In 
      addition, we perform parameter sensitivity analysis to assess how different 
      processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and input from stem cells, impact 
      anagen duration in healthy versus AA-affected HFs. The proposed model may help in 
      evaluating the effectiveness of existing treatments and identifying new potential 
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Ultraviolet B inhibition of DNMT1 activity via AhR activation dependent SIRT1 
      suppression in CD4+ T cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
PG  - 230-237
LID - S0923-1811(17)30002-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2017.03.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that ultraviolet B (UVB) inhibits DNA 
      methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) activity in CD4+ T cells from systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE) patients. Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 
      1 (SIRT1) is a type of Class III histone deacetylases (HDACs), and has been 
      reported to play roles in the pathogenesis of different autoimmune diseases and 
      can modulate DNMT1 activity. Moreover, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been 
      reported to link UVB with SLE. However, the exact mechanisms by which DNMT1 
      activity is inhibited by UVB in lupus CD4+ T cells remain largely unknown. 
      OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the exact mechanisms by which DNMT1 activity is inhibited 
      by UVB in lupus CD4+ T cells. METHODS: Twenty-two newly diagnosed active SLE 
      patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells were 
      isolated, cultured and treated. DNMT1 activity assay, quantitative real-time PCR 
      (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, RNA interference using small interfering RNA and 
      Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were employed. RESULTS: DNMT1 activity 
      was inhibited in si-SIRT1-transfected CD4+ T cells, and increased by the 
      established SIRT1 activator, SRT1720. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression 
      of SIRT1 were suppressed by UVB exposure in lupus CD4+ T cells. UVB-inhibited 
      DNMT1 activity was reversed by SRT1720 in si-control-transfected lupus CD4+ T 
      cells, but not in si-SIRT1-transfected lupus CD4 + T cells. Furthermore, AhR 
      activation by VAF347 reduced the mRNA and protein expression of SIRT1. ChIP using 
      an antibody against AhR in normal CD4+ T cells revealed a 16-fold stronger signal 
      at the site about 1.6kb upstream from the translation start site of the SIRT1 
      promoter. Finally, UVB could activate AhR and inhibit the mRNA and protein 
      expression of SIRT1. AhR knockdown abrogated the inhibition of UVB-mediated SIRT1 
      mRNA and protein expression and DNMT1 activity in lupus CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: 
      UVB suppressed SIRT1 expression via activating AhR, and subsequently inhibited 
      DNMT1 activity in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients.

TI  - The phenolic fraction of extra virgin olive oil modulates the activation and the 
      inflammatory response of T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus 
      and healthy donors.
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201601080 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multiorgan autoimmune 
      disease characterized by immune deregulation, which involves altered T-cell 
      response and imbalance of cytokine production. The phenolic fraction (PE) of 
      extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
      properties and exerts preventive effects in murine models of immune-inflammatory 
      diseases, such as SLE. The present study was designed to determine the in vitro 
      effects of the PE from EVOO on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 
      inactive patients with SLE and healthy donors. METHODS AND RESULTS: T-cell 
      phenotype was investigated by flow cytometry, cytokine levels were determined by 
      ELISA, and protein expression was detected by Western blot. The PE of EVOO 
      decreased the frequency of CD69(+) cells and the secretion of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6, 
      IL-1beta, and IL-10. Moreover, PE increased the expression of I-kappa-B-alpha and 
      decreased extracellular signal regulated kinase phosphorylation on PBMC from 
      patients with SLE and healthy donors. CONCLUSION: PE modulates cytokine 
      production and attenuates induced T-cell activation, probably through NF-kappaB 
      signaling pathway, providing the first evidence that PE from EVOO has an 
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role in SLE patients and it might 
      therefore be considered as a dietary complement in SLE management.

AB  - Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, which is characterized by aberrantly high 
      levels of inflammation, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are still not 
      fully understood. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 
      STAT3, and the downstream proteins suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and 
      SOCS3, have been implicated in psoriasis disease progression. Calcipotriol, a 
      synthetic derivative of vitamin D, has been used clinically to treat psoriasis, 
      but the mechanism of action that underlies the beneficial effects of calcipotriol 
      is still being explored. The objective of this study was to determine whether 
      STAT1 and STAT3 signaling is involved in calcipotriol treatment. Using an in 
      vitro immortal human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells, as a psoriasis model, 
      we examined the molecular signaling induced by calcipotriol treatment. We found 
      that calcipotriol treatment or silencing of either STAT1 or STAT3 inhibited 
      proliferation of HaCaT cells. Calcipotriol downregulated the expression of STAT1 
      and STAT3 at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. The levels of 
      phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 were also decreased, suggesting calcipotriol 
      treatment inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 activation. Calcipotriol-mediated STAT 
      inhibition was further substantiated by the downregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 at 
      the mRNA and protein expression levels. Taken together, our results suggest a 
      novel molecular mechanism for calcipotriol-mediated treatment effects in 
      psoriasis.

TI  - Non-pathogenic pemphigus foliaceus (PF) IgG acts synergistically with a directly 
      pathogenic PF IgG to increase blistering by p38MAPK-dependent desmoglein 1 
      clustering.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) is an autoimmune blistering disease caused 
      by autoantibodies (Abs) against desmoglein 1 (Dsg1). PF sera contain polyclonal 
      Abs which are heterogeneous mixture of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Abs, as 
      shown by isolation of monoclonal Abs (mAbs). OBJECTIVE: To investigate how 
      pathogenic and non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 Abs contribute to blister formation in 
      PF. METHODS: Using organ-cultured human skin, we compared the effect of a single 
      pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG mAb, a single non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG mAb, and 
      their mixture on blister formation as analyzed by histology, subcellular 
      localization of IgG deposits and desmosomal proteins by confocal microscopy, and 
      desmosomal structure by electron microscopy. In addition, we measured 
      keratinocyte adhesion by an in vitro dissociation assay. RESULTS: 24h after 
      injection, a single pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG caused a subcorneal blister with IgG 
      and Dsg1 localized linearly on the cell surface of keratinocytes. A single 
      non-pathogenic anti-Dsg1 IgG bound linearly on the keratinocytes but did not 
      induce blisters. A pathogenic and a non-pathogenic IgG mAb injected together 
      caused an aberrant granular pattern of IgG and Dsg1 in the lower epidermis with 
      blister formation in the superficial epidermis. Electron microscopy demonstrated 
      that the mixture of mAbs shortened desmosomal lengths more than a single mAb in 
      the basal and spinous layers. Furthermore, although Dsg1 clustering required both 
      cross-linking of Dsg1 molecules by the non-pathogenic IgG plus a pathogenic 
      antibody, the latter could be in the form of a monovalent single chain variable 
      fragment, suggesting that loss of trans-interaction of Dsg1 is required for 
      clustering. Finally, a p38MAPK inhibitor blocked Dsg1 clustering. When pathogenic 
      strength was measured by the dissociation assay, a mixture of pathogenic and 
      non-pathogenic IgG mAbs disrupted keratinocyte adhesion more than a single 
      pathogenic mAb. This pathogenic effect was only partially suppressed by the 
      p38MAPK inhibitor. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that a polyclonal mixture 
      of anti-Dsg1 IgG antibodies enhances pathogenic activity for blister formation 
      associated with p38MAPK-dependent Dsg1 clustering and that not only pathogenic 
      antibodies but also non-pathogenic antibodies coordinately contribute to blister 
      formation in PF.

TI  - Biomarker Discovery by Modeling Behcet's Disease with Patient-Specific Human 
      Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.

AB  - Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory and multisystemic autoimmune 
      disease of unknown etiology. Due to the lack of a specific test for BD, its 
      diagnosis is very difficult and therapeutic options are limited. Induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, which provides inaccessible 
      disease-relevant cell types, opens a new era for disease treatment. In this 
      study, we generated BD iPSCs from patient somatic cells and differentiated them 
      into hematopoietic precursor cells (BD iPSC-HPCs) as BD model cells. Based on 
      comparative transcriptome analysis using our BD model cells, we identified eight 
      novel BD-specific genes, AGTR2, CA9, CD44, CXCL1, HTN3, IL-2, PTGER4, and TSLP, 
      which were differentially expressed in BD patients compared with healthy controls 
      or patients with other immune diseases. The use of CXCL1 as a BD biomarker was 
      further validated at the protein level using both a BD iPSC-HPC-based assay 
      system and BD patient serum samples. Furthermore, we show that our BD 
      iPSC-HPC-based drug screening system is highly effective for testing CXCL1 BD 
      biomarkers, as determined by monitoring the efficacy of existing 
      anti-inflammatory drugs. Our results shed new light on the usefulness of 
      patient-specific iPSC technology in the development of a benchmarking platform 
      for disease-specific biomarkers, phenotype- or target-driven drug discovery, and 
      patient-tailored therapies.

TI  - Celiac anti-type 2 transglutaminase antibodies induce differential effects in 
      fibroblasts from celiac disease patients and from healthy subjects.
PG  - 541-550
LID - 10.1007/s00726-016-2307-z [doi]
AB  - Type 2 transglutaminase (TG2) has an important pathogenic role in celiac disease 
      (CD), an inflammatory intestinal disease that is caused by the ingestion of 
      gluten-containing cereals. Indeed, TG2 deamidates specific gliadin peptides, thus 
      enhancing their immunogenicity. Moreover, the transamidating activity seems to 
      provoke an autoimmune response, where TG2 is the main autoantigen. Many studies 
      have highlighted a possible pathogenetic role of anti-TG2 antibodies, because 
      they modulate TG2 enzymatic activity and they can interact with cell-surface TG2, 
      triggering a wide range of intracellular responses. Autoantibodies also alter the 
      uptake of the alpha-gliadin peptide 31-43 (p31-43), responsible of the innate 
      immune response in CD, thus partially protecting cells from p31-43 damaging 
      effects in an intestinal cell line. Here, we investigated whether anti-TG2 
      antibodies protect cells from p31-43-induced damage in a CD model consisting of 
      primary dermal fibroblasts. We found that the antibodies specifically reduced the 
      uptake of p31-43 by fibroblasts derived from healthy subjects but not in those 
      derived from CD patients. Analyses of TG2 expression and enzymatic activity did 
      not reveal any significant difference between fibroblasts from healthy and celiac 
      subjects, suggesting that other features related to TG2 may be responsible of 
      such different behaviors, e.g., trafficking or subcellular distribution. Our 
      findings are in line with the concept that a "celiac cellular phenotype" exists 
      and that TG2 may contribute to this phenotype. Moreover, they suggest that the 
      autoimmune response to TG2, which alone may damage the celiac mucosa, also fails 
      in its protective role in celiac cells.

TI  - BAFF Expression is Modulated by Female Hormones in Human Immune Cells.
PG  - 722-30
LID - 10.1007/s10528-016-9752-y [doi]
AB  - Among several autoimmune diseases, one of the main risk factors is the female 
      gender, and much consideration has been given to the involvement of female 
      hormones in their etiology. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) is a key factor in 
      survival and maturation of B cells and is overexpressed in several autoimmune 
      patients although the mechanism behind this feature is unclear. In murine models, 
      BAFF expression could be upregulated by exogenous estrogen treatment in 
      splenocytes; however, no evidence of this relationship was available in humans. 
      Here, leukocytes from healthy male and female individuals were collected and 
      cultivated in the presence or absence of estrogen or progesterone. BAFF gene 
      expression was accessed by quantitative PCR and compared between treated and 
      untreated group of cells. In the presence of estrogen, BAFF expression was 
      upregulated by more than 5 times in both genders. When exposed to progesterone, 
      the female-originated cells showed increased expression, while the cells of male 
      origin a significant downregulation of BAFF. Our results suggest that female 
      hormones can modulate the expression of BAFF, a key cytokine in autoimmune 
      pathways, in human immune cells. These data might contribute to the understanding 
      of the etiology as well as the gender bias featured by several autoimmune 
      disorders.

TI  - Antigen-Specific Binding of Multivalent Soluble Antigen Arrays Induces Receptor 
      Clustering and Impedes B Cell Receptor Mediated Signaling.
PG  - 710-22
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01097 [doi]
AB  - A pressing need exists for autoimmune disease therapies that act in an 
      antigen-specific manner while avoiding global immunosuppression. Multivalent 
      soluble antigen arrays (SAgAPLP:LABL), designed to induce tolerance to a specific 
      multiple sclerosis autoantigen, consist of a flexible hyaluronic acid (HA) 
      polymer backbone cografted with multiple copies of autoantigen peptide (PLP) and 
      cell adhesion inhibitor peptide (LABL). Previous in vivo studies revealed 
      copresentation of both signals on HA was necessary for therapeutic efficacy. To 
      elucidate therapeutic cellular mechanisms, in vitro studies were performed in a 
      model B cell system to evaluate binding and specificity. Compared to HA and HA 
      arrays containing only grafted PLP or LABL, SAgAPLP:LABL displaying both PLP and 
      LABL exhibited greatly enhanced B cell binding. Furthermore, the binding avidity 
      of SAgAPLP:LABL was primarily driven by the PLP antigen, determined via flow 
      cytometry competitive dissociation studies. Fluorescence microscopy showed 
      SAgAPLP:LABL induced mature receptor clustering that was faster than other HA 
      arrays with only one type of grafted peptide. SAgAPLP:LABL molecules also reduced 
      and inhibited IgM-stimulated signaling as discerned by a calcium flux assay. The 
      molecular mechanisms of enhanced antigen-specific binding, mature receptor 
      clustering, and dampened signaling observed in B cells may contribute to 
      SAgAPLP:LABL therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Inhibition of angiogenesis by platelets in systemic sclerosis patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease 
      characterized by microvascular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. It has become 
      increasingly evident that platelets, beyond regulating hemostasis, are important 
      in inflammation and innate immunity. Platelets may be an important source of 
      proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines in the vascular microenvironment. In 
      this study, we sought to assess the contribution of platelet-derived factors in 
      patients with SSc to the angiogenesis of human dermal microvascular endothelial 
      cells (DMVECs) in a tubule formation assay and to characterize the secretion of 
      profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines in these platelets. METHODS: We 
      analyzed platelets obtained from 30 patients with SSc and 12 healthy control 
      subjects. Angiogenesis was evaluated in vitro with a DMVEC tubule formation assay 
      on Matrigel and platelet-derived angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF), 165b isoform (VEGF165b), and cytokine secretion was 
      evaluated. Platelet serotonin content was also determined. RESULTS: When DMVECs 
      were incubated with SSc platelet releasates, tubule formation was significantly 
      inhibited (p < 0.01, t test), and higher expression of endothelin-1 in these 
      cells was observed compared with control subjects (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U 
      test). In SSc platelet releasates, VEGF165b was significantly higher (p < 0.05, t 
      test), and the VEGF165b/VEGF ratio was increased compared with that of control 
      subjects. Higher secretion of transforming growth factor beta (p < 0.01, t test) and 
      CD40L (p < 0.01, t test) was observed compared with control subjects. Also, 
      intraplatelet serotonin levels were lower in platelets obtained from patients 
      with diffuse SSc compared with patients with limited SSc and control subjects 
      (p < 0.05, t test). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that antiangiogenic factors 
      such as VEGF165b, together with proinflammatory and profibrotic factors secreted 
      by platelets, can contribute to the progression of peripheral microvascular 
      damage, defective vascular repair, and fibrosis in patients with SSc.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that results from the destruction 
      of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells, leading to abolition of insulin 
      secretion and onset of diabetes. Cytotoxic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, activated 
      by antigen presenting cells (APCs), are both implicated in disease onset and 
      progression. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), on the other hand, play a leading role 
      in regulating immunological tolerance and resistant homoeostasis in T1D by 
      suppressing effector T cells (Teffs). Recent data indicates that after 
      activation, conventional Teffs transiently produce interleukin IL-2, a cytokine 
      that acts as a growth factor for both Teffs and Tregs. Tregs suppress Teffs 
      through IL-2 deprivation, competition and Teff conversion into inducible Tregs 
      (iTregs). To investigate the interactions of these components during T1D 
      progression, a mathematical model of T-cell dynamics is developed as a predictor 
      of beta-cell loss, with the underlying hypothesis that avidity of Teffs and Tregs, 
      i.e., the binding affinity of T-cell receptors to peptide-major 
      histocompatibility complexes on host cells, is continuum. The model is used to 
      infer a set of criteria that determines susceptibility to T1D in high risk 
      subjects. Our findings show that diabetes onset is guided by the absence of 
      Treg-to-Teff dominance at specific high avidities, rather than over the whole 
      range of avidity, and that the lack of overall dominance of Teffs-to-Tregs over 
      time is the underlying cause of the "honeymoon period", the remission phase 
      observed in some T1D patients. The model also suggests that competition between 
      Teffs and Tregs is more effective than Teff-induction into iTregs in suppressing 
      Teffs, and that a prolonged full width at half maximum of IL-2 release is a 
      necessary condition for curbing disease onset. Finally, the model provides a 
      rationale for observing rapid and slow progressors of T1D based on modest 
      heterogeneity in the kinetic parameters.

TI  - Amplification of IL-21 signalling pathway through Bruton's tyrosine kinase in 
      human B cell activation.
PG  - 1488-97
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keu532 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune 
      diseases. The role of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) in cytokine-induced human B 
      cell differentiation and class-switch recombination remains incompletely defined. 
      This study analysed the effect of Btk on human activated B cells. METHODS: 
      Purified B cells from healthy subjects were stimulated with B cell receptor (BCR) 
      and other stimuli with or without a Btk inhibitor and gene expression was 
      measured. The B cell line BJAB was used to assess Btk-associated signalling 
      cascades. Phosphorylated Btk (p-Btk) in peripheral blood B cells obtained from 10 
      healthy subjects and 41 patients with RA was measured by flow cytometry and 
      compared with patient backgrounds. RESULTS: IL-21 signalling, in concert with 
      BCR, CD40 and BAFF signals, led to robust expression of differentiation- and 
      class-switch DNA recombination-related genes and IgG production in human B cells, 
      all of which were significantly suppressed by the Btk inhibitor. Although 
      phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was induced by co-stimulation with IL-21, BCR 
      and CD40, STAT1 phosphorylation in the nucleus, but not in the cytoplasm, was 
      exclusively impaired by Btk blockade. High levels of p-Btk were noted in B cells 
      of RA patients compared with controls and they correlated significantly with 
      titres of RF among RF-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The findings elucidate a 
      model in which Btk not only plays a fundamental role in the regulation of BCR 
      signalling, but may also mediate crosstalk with cytokine signalling pathways 
      through regulation of IL-21-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in the nuclei of 
      human B cells. Btk appears to have pathological relevance in RA.

TI  - Calcitriol exerts anti-inflammatory effects in keratinocytes treated with 
      autoantibodies from a patient with bullous pemphigoid.
PG  - 288-92
LID - 10.1111/jdv.12929 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hormonally active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol and its 
      analogues exert potent effects on cellular differentiation and regulation of 
      immune responses. Although topical vitamin D analogues are widely used for 
      treatment of psoriasis and vitamin D has been increasingly implicated in 
      prevention and protection from several autoimmune diseases, experimental and 
      clinical data in autoimmune bullous diseases are generally lacking. OBJECTIVE: 
      Here, we investigated the effects of calcitriol on keratinocytes treated by 
      bullous pemphigoid (BP) autoantibodies. METHODS: Human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells 
      were treated with purified human BP or normal IgG from one BP patient and healthy 
      subject, respectively, in the absence or presence of calcitriol and effects on 
      (i) cell viability, (ii) IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, (iii) STAT3 and NFkappaB 
      activation, (iv) heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) level, and (v) vitamin D receptor 
      (VDR) expression were studied. RESULTS: We found that BP IgG-induced IL-6 and 
      IL-8 release from HaCaT cells was reduced in the presence of non-toxic doses of 
      calcitriol. Additionally, calcitriol blunted BP IgG-mediated STAT3 
      phosphorylation and NFkappaB activity, whereas Hsp70 and VDR expression were not 
      affected. CONCLUSION: Although the results of this study are based on 
      autoantibodies prepared from a single patient, they show that calcitriol protects 
      from BP IgG-induced inflammatory processes in vitro, thus favouring its potential 
      inclusion into the therapeutic repertoire of BP.

AB  - There remain major gaps in our knowledge regarding the detailed mechanisms by 
      which autoantibodies mediate damage at the tissue level. We have undertaken novel 
      strategies at the interface of engineering and clinical medicine to integrate 
      nanoscale visual and structural data using nanorobotic atomic force microscopy 
      with cell functional analyses to reveal previously unattainable details of 
      autoimmune processes in real-time. Pemphigus vulgaris is a life-threatening 
      autoimmune blistering skin condition in which there is disruption of desmosomal 
      cell-cell adhesion structures that are associated with the presence of antibodies 
      directed against specific epithelial proteins including Desmoglein (Dsg) 3. We 
      demonstrate that pathogenic (blister-forming) anti-Dsg3 antibodies, distinct from 
      non-pathogenic (non-blister forming) anti-Dsg3 antibodies, alter the structural 
      and functional properties of keratinocytes in two sequential steps--an initial 
      loss of cell adhesion and a later induction of apoptosis-related signaling 
      pathways, but not full apoptotic cell death. We propose a "2-Hit" model for 
      autoimmune disruption associated with skin-specific pathogenic autoantibodies. 
      These data provide unprecedented details of autoimmune processes at the tissue 
      level and offer a novel conceptual framework for understanding the action of 
      self-reactive antibodies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells 
      of the immune system, involved in both initiating immune responses and 
      maintaining tolerance. Dysfunctional and via toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands 
      activated DC have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, but 
      their role in the etiology of Sjogren's syndrome, a chronic inflammatory 
      autoimmune disease characterized by progressive mononuclear cell infiltration in 
      the exocrine glands, has not been revealed yet. Therefore, the aim of this study 
      was to investigate phenotype and functional properties of immature and TLR7/8 
      stimulated monocyte-derived DC (moDC) of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome 
      (pSS) and compare them to healthy controls. METHODS: The phenotype, apoptosis 
      susceptibility and endocytic capacity of moDC were analyzed by flow cytometry. 
      Secretion of cytokines was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      and multiplex Luminex analyses in moDC cell culture supernatants. The expression 
      of TLR7 was analyzed by flow cytometry and real-time quantitative polymerase 
      chain reaction (qPCR). Expression of Ro/Sjogren's syndrome-associated autoantigen 
      A (Ro52/SSA), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF-8), Bim, signal transduction 
      and activators of transcription (Stat) 1, p-Stat1 (Tyrosin 701), p-Stat1 (Serin 
      727), Stat3, pStat3 (Tyrosin 705) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphatase dehydrogenase 
      (GAPDH) was measured by Western blotting. Nuclear factor 
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) family members were 
      quantified using the ELISA-based TransAM NF-kappaB family kit. RESULTS: We could not 
      detect differences in expression of co-stimulatory molecules and maturation 
      markers such as cluster of differentiation (CD) 86, CD80, CD40 or CD83 on moDC 
      from patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we could not observe 
      variations in apoptosis susceptibility, Bim and Ro52/SSA expression and the 
      endocytic capacity of the moDC. However, we found that moDC from pSS patients 
      expressed increased levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II 
      molecule human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. We also found significant differences 
      in cytokine production by moDC, where increased interleukin (IL)-12p40 secretion 
      in mature pSS moDC correlated with increased RelB expression. Strikingly, moDC 
      from pSS patients matured for 48 hours with TLR7/8 ligand CL097 expressed 
      significantly less Stat1. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a role for moDC in the 
      pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome.

TI  - Recombinant human IgA1 and IgA2 autoantibodies to type VII collagen induce 
      subepidermal blistering ex vivo.
PG  - 1600-8
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1400160 [doi]
AB  - Subepidermal autoimmune blistering dermatoses (AIBD) are prototypic 
      autoantibody-mediated diseases. In epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), an 
      autoimmune disease with severe and chronic skin blistering, autoantibodies are 
      directed against type VII collagen. IgG is the predominant autoantibody isotype 
      of EBA, the pathogenicity of which has been demonstrated in a variety of in vivo 
      and ex vivo disease models. In contrast, there is not much evidence for the 
      pathogenicity of IgA, which may appear as the only autoantibody isotype in some 
      EBA patients. To investigate the pathogenic potential of IgA autoantibodies, we 
      generated chimeric V gene-matched human IgA1, IgA2, and control IgG1 
      autoantibodies directed against type VII collagen. Immobilized immune complexes 
      containing the rIgA1 and rIgA2 autoantibodies induced the dose-dependent release 
      of reactive oxygen species from neutrophil granulocytes, a precondition for 
      blister formation. Moreover, both rIgA1 and rIgA2 induced leukocyte-dependent 
      dermal-epidermal separation in cryosections of human skin. In contrast with 
      rIgG1, neither rIgA1 nor rIgA2 was capable of inducing complement deposition at 
      the dermal-epidermal junction. Because complement activation is a prerequisite 
      for blister induction, this lack of function compared with IgG1 may be 
      compensated for by the stronger activation of neutrophil granulocytes by both 
      IgA1 and IgA2. For IgG-mediated AIBD, immunoadsorption therapy is a convenient 
      treatment modality for the removal of pathogenic autoantibodies, particularly in 
      treatment-resistant cases. The results of this study show the pathogenic 
      potential of IgA autoantibodies and support the development of adsorber matrices 
      for IgA-mediated AIBD.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter produced mainly in the central nervous system 
      (CNS) that has immunomodulatory actions on T cells. As the multiple sclerosis 
      (MS) has long been regarded as an autoimmune disease of CNS mediated by T cells, 
      the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of DA on in vitro 
      functional status of T cells from relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS patients. 
      Peripheral T-cells from RR-MS patients were activated by mitogens and cell 
      proliferation and cytokine production were assayed by [(3)H]-thymidine uptake and 
      ELISA, respectively. Our results demonstrated that DA enhanced in vitro T cell 
      proliferation and Th17-related cytokines in MS-derived cell cultures. In 
      addition, this catecholamine reduced Treg-related cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-beta) 
      release by activated CD4(+) T cells. These DA-induced effects on T cells were 
      mainly dependent on IL-6 production by both polyclonally-activated CD4(+) T cells 
      and LPS-stimulated monocytes. Furthermore, the production of IL-17 and IL-6 by 
      MS-derived T cells was directly related with neurological disability (EDSS 
      score), and the release of these cytokines was less sensitive to glucocorticoid 
      inhibition in MS patients than in control group, mainly after DA addition. In 
      conclusion, our data suggest that DA amplifies glucocorticoid-resistant Th17 
      phenotype in MS patients, and this phenomenon could be, at least in part, due to 
      its ability to induce IL-6 production by monocytes and CD4(+) T cells.

      inflammation and synovial hyperplasia leading to progressive joint destruction. 
      Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are central components of the aggressive, 
      tumour-like synovial structure termed pannus, which invades the joint space and 
      cartilage. A distinct natural killer (NK) cell subset expressing the inhibitory 
      CD94/NKG2A receptor is present in RA synovial fluid. Little is known about 
      possible cellular interactions between RA-FLS and NK cells. We used cultured 
      RA-FLS and the human NK cell line Nishi, of which the latter expresses an NK 
      receptor repertoire similar to that of NK cells in RA synovial fluid, as an in 
      vitro model system of RA-FLS/NK cell cross-talk. We show that RA-FLS express 
      numerous ligands for both activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, and 
      stimulate degranulation of Nishi cells. We found that NKG2D, DNAM-1, NKp46 and 
      NKp44 are the key activating receptors involved in Nishi cell degranulation 
      towards RA-FLS. Moreover, blockade of the interaction between CD94/NKG2A and its 
      ligand HLA-E expressed on RA-FLS further enhanced Nishi cell degranulation in 
      co-culture with RA-FLS. Using cultured RA-FLS and the human NK cell line Nishi as 
      an in vitro model system of RA-FLS/NK cell cross-talk, our results suggest that 
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity of RA-FLS may be one mechanism by which NK cells 
      influence local joint inflammation in RA.

TI  - A patient-specific model of the negative-feedback control of the 
      hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in autoimmune (Hashimoto's) 
      thyroiditis.

AB  - The purpose of modelling the negative-feedback control mechanism of the 
      hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis 
      is to describe the clinical course of euthyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism 
      and overt hypothyroidism for patients. Thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and 
      triiodothyronine (T3) levels are controlled by negative-feedback control through 
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). T4, like other hormones, can be bound or 
      unbound; the unbound T4 (FT4) is used as a marker for hypothyroidism. Autoimmune 
      thyroiditis is a disease in which the thyroid-infiltrating lymphocytes attack 
      autoantigens in follicle cells, destroying them over a long time. To describe the 
      operation of the feedback control, we developed a mathematical model involving 
      four clinical variables: TSH, FT4, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies and the 
      thyroid gland's functional size. The first three variables are regularly measured 
      while the last variable is determined through relationships between the other 
      three variables. The problem of two different time scales for circulating 
      hormones and thyroid damage is addressed using singular perturbation theory. 
      Analysis of the mathematical model establishes stability and conditions under 
      which the diseased state can maintain the slow movement toward diseased state 
      equilibrium. Although we have used four variables in modelling the feedback 
      control through the HPT axis, the predicted clinical course given any set of 
      parameters is shown to depend on the steady-state levels of TSH and FT4. This 
      observation makes possible the development of the clinical charts based only on 
      the levels of TSH, time and potential steady-state values. To validate the model 
      predictions, a dataset obtained from a Sicilian adult population has been 
      employed.
