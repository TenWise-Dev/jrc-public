AB  - BACKGROUND: The transfer of pathogenic immunoglobulin G antibodies from mother to 
      fetus is a critical step in the pathophysiology of alloimmune and autoimmune 
      diseases of the fetus and neonate. Immunoglobulin G transfer across the human 
      placenta to the fetus is mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor, and blockade of 
      the neonatal Fc receptor may provide a therapeutic strategy to prevent or 
      minimize pathological events associated with immune-mediated diseases of 
      pregnancy. M281 is a fully human, aglycosylated monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 
      antineonatal Fc receptor antibody that has been shown to block the neonatal Fc 
      receptor with high affinity in nonclinical studies and in a phase 1 study in 
      healthy volunteers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the 
      transplacental transfer of M281 and its potential to inhibit transfer of 
      immunoglobulin G from maternal to fetal circulation. STUDY DESIGN: To determine 
      the concentration of M281 required for rapid cellular uptake and complete 
      saturation of the neonatal Fc receptor in placental trophoblasts, primary human 
      villous trophoblasts were incubated with various concentrations of M281 in a 
      receptor occupancy assay. The placental transfer of M281, immunoglobulin G, and 
      immunoglobulin G in the presence of M281 was studied using the dually perfused 
      human placental lobule model. Immunoglobulin G transfer was established using a 
      representative immunoglobulin G molecule, adalimumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 
      monoclonal antibody, at a concentration of 270 mug/mL. Inhibition of 
      immunoglobulin G transfer by M281 was determined by cotransfusing 270 mug/mL of 
      adalimumab with 10 mug/mL or 300 mug/mL of M281. Concentrations of adalimumab and 
      M281 in sample aliquots from maternal and fetal circuits were analyzed using a 
      sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Meso Scale Discovery assay, 
      respectively. RESULTS: In primary human villous trophoblasts, the saturation of 
      the neonatal Fc receptor by M281 was observed within 30-60 minutes at 0.15-5.0 
      mug/mL, suggesting rapid blockade of neonatal Fc receptor in placental cells. The 
      transfer rate of adalimumab (0.23% +/- 0.21%) across dually perfused human 
      placental lobule was significantly decreased by 10 mug/mL and 300 mug/mL of M281 to 
      0.07 +/- 0.01% and 0.06 +/- 0.01%, respectively. Furthermore, the transfer rate of 
      M281 was 0.002% +/- 0.02%, approximately 100-fold lower than that of adalimumab. 
      CONCLUSION: The significant inhibition of immunoglobulin G transfer across the 
      human placental lobule by M281 and the minimal transfer of M281 supports the 
      development of M281 as a novel agent for the treatment of fetal and neonatal 
      diseases caused by transplacental transfer of alloimmune and autoimmune 
      pathogenic immunoglobulin G antibodies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used for a wide range of 
      therapeutic applications because of not only their differentiation potential but 
      also their ability to secrete bioactive factors. Recently, several studies have 
      suggested the use of human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs (hE-MSCs) as an 
      alternative for regenerative cellular therapy due to mass production of MSCs from 
      a single donor. METHODS: We generated hE-MSCs from embryonic stem cell lines, 
      SNUhES3, and analyzed immune properties of these cells. Also, we evaluated the 
      in-vivo therapeutic potential of hE-MSCs in immune-mediated inflammatory skin 
      disease. RESULTS: The cell showed the suppression of immunity associated with 
      allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte response assay. 
      We also detected that cytokines and growth factor related to the immune response 
      were secreted from these cells. To assessed the in-vivo therapeutic potential of 
      hE-MSCs in immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, we used imiquimod 
      (IMQ)-induced skin psoriasis mouse model. The score of clinical skin was 
      significantly reduced in the hE-MSCs treated group compared with control IMQ 
      group. In histological analysis, the IMQ-induced epidermal thickness was 
      significantly decreased by hE-MSCs treatment. It was correlated with splenomegaly 
      induced by IMQ which was also improved in the hE-MSCs. Moreover, IMQ-induced 
      inflammatory cytokines; Th1 cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma,and IL-27) and Th17 
      cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23), in the serum and skin showed marked inhibition by 
      hE-MSCs. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that hE-MSCs have a potency of 
      immune modulation in psoriasis, which might be the key factor for the improved 
      psoriasis.

TI  - Abnormal inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by mesenchymal stem cells through the 
      miR-4284/CXCL5 axis in ankylosing spondylitis.
PG  - 188

LID - 188
AB  - Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common inflammatory autoimmune disease, 
      characterized by pathological osteogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as the 
      main source of osteoblasts, participate in bone remodeling not only through 
      differentiation into osteoblasts but also through indirect regulation of 
      osteoclastogenesis. Our previous study indicated that the stronger osteogenic 
      differentiation of MSCs from AS patients (ASMSCs) involved in pathological 
      osteogenesis. However, whether there is any abnormality in the regulation of 
      osteoclastogenesis by ASMSCs remains unclear. In this study, ASMSCs or MSCs from 
      healthy donors (HDMSCs) were co-cultured with CD14 + monocytes in osteoclast 
      induction medium. Our results demonstrated that ASMSCs exhibited a stronger 
      capacity to inhibit osteoclastogenesis than HDMSCs. To explore underlying 
      mechanisms, cytokine array assays were performed, showing that ASMSCs secreted 
      more CXCL5 than HDMSCs, which was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assays. Moreover, inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by ASMSCs was recovered by 
      decreasing CXCL5. Besides, the inhibitory effect of CXCL5 on osteoclastogenesis 
      was confirmed by exogenous addition. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to find 
      the interaction between miR-4284 and CXCL5, which was verified by luciferase 
      reporter assays. Furthermore, we used miR-4284 inhibitors or mimics to prove that 
      the expression of CXCL5 was regulated by miR-4284. Further analysis showed that 
      downregulation of miR-4284 in MSCs resulted in increase of CXCL5, markedly 
      inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, whereas upregulation of miR-4284 in MSCs had the 
      opposite effect. Our findings indicate that ASMSCs exhibit a stronger capacity to 
      inhibit osteoclastogenesis than HDMSCs through the miR-4284/CXCL5 axis, which 
      provide a new perspective on the mechanism of pathologic osteogenesis in AS.

AB  - Pluripotent stem cell transplantation is a promising regenerative strategy for 
      treating intractable diseases. However, securing human leukocyte antigen 
      (HLA)-matched donor stem cells is extremely difficult. The traditional approach 
      for generating such cells is to establish homozygous pluripotent stem cell lines. 
      Unfortunately, because of HLA diversity, this strategy is too time-consuming to 
      be of practical use. HLA engineering of donor stem cells has been proposed 
      recently as a means to evade graft-versus-host rejection in stem cell 
      allotransplantation. This approach would be advantageous in both time and cost to 
      the traditional method, but its feasibility must be investigated. In this study, 
      we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout HLA-B from inducible pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSCs) with heterogenous HLA-B and showed that the HLA-B knockout iPSCs resulted 
      in less immunogenicity in HLA-B antisera than that in the control. Our results 
      support the feasibility of HLA-engineered iPSCs in stem cell allotransplantation.

TI  - Preconditioning Enhances the Therapeutic Effects of Mesenchymal Stem Cells on 
      Colitis Through PGE2-Mediated T-Cell Modulation.
PG  - 1352-1367
LID - 10.1177/0963689718780304 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based cell therapy has been demonstrated as a 
      promising strategy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is 
      considered an immune disease. While the exact mechanisms underlying the 
      therapeutic effect of MSCs are still unclear, MSCs display anti-inflammatory and 
      immunomodulatory effects by interacting with various immunoregulatory cells. Our 
      previous studies have shown that MSCs can be preconditioned and deconditioned 
      with enhanced cell survival, differentiation and migration. In this study, we 
      evaluated the effect of preconditioning on the immunoregulatory function of human 
      umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUCMSCs) and their therapeutic effect on treating 
      IBD. Our results show that intraperitoneal administration of deconditioned 
      hUCMSCs (De-hUCMSCs) reduces the disease activity index (DAI), histological 
      colitis score and destruction of the epithelial barrier, and increases the body 
      weight recovery more intensively than that of un-manipulated hUCMSCs. In 
      addition, De-hUCMSCs but not hUCMSCs elicit anti-apoptotic effects via induction 
      of the ERK pathway during the early stage of IBD development. In vitro co-culture 
      studies indicate that De-hUCMSCs suppress T-cell proliferation and activation 
      more markedly than hUCMSCs. Moreover, De-hUCMSCs block the induction of 
      inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interleukin 
      (IL)-2, while promoting the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in 
      T-cells. Mechanically, we find that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion is 
      significantly increased in De-hUCMSCs, the suppression of which dramatically 
      abrogates the inhibitory effect of De-hUCMSCs on T-cell activation, implying that 
      the crosstalk between De-hUCMSCs and T-cells is mediated by PGE2. Together, we 
      have demonstrated that preconditioning enhances the immunosuppressive and 
      therapeutic effects of hUCMSCs on treating IBD via increased secretion of PGE2.

TI  - C5a-Preactivated Neutrophils Are Critical for Autoimmune-Induced Astrocyte 
      Dysregulation in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder.

AB  - Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune neuroinflammatory 
      disease. In contrast to multiple sclerosis, autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 
      (AQP4) expressed on astrocytic end-feet have been exclusively detected in sera of 
      NMOSD patients. Several lines of evidence suggested that anti-AQP4 autoantibodies 
      are pathogenic, but the mechanism triggering inflammation, impairment of 
      astrocyte function, and the role of neutrophils presented in NMOSD cerebrospinal 
      fluid remains unknown. In this study, we tested how human neutrophils affect 
      astrocytes in the presence of anti-AQP4 Ab-positive serum derived from NMOSD 
      patients. An in vitro model of inflammation consisted of human astrocyte line, 
      NMOSD serum, and allogenic peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy individuals. 
      We showed evidence of pathogenicity of NMOSD serum, which by consecutive action 
      of anti-AQP4 Abs, complement system, and neutrophils affected astrocyte function. 
      Anti-AQP4 Ab binding astrocytes initiated two parallel complementary reactions. 
      The first one was dependent on the complement cytotoxicity via C5b-9 complex 
      formation, and the second one on the reverse of astrocyte glutamate pump into 
      extracellular space by C5a-preactivated neutrophils. As a consequence, astrocytes 
      were partially destroyed; however, a major population of astrocytes polarized 
      into proinflammatory cells which were characterized by pathological glutamate 
      removal from extracellular space.

TI  - TGF-beta-responsive CAR-T cells promote anti-tumor immune function.
PG  - 75-86
LID - 10.1002/btm2.10097 [doi]
AB  - A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that responds to transforming growth factor 
      beta (TGF-beta) enables the engineering of T cells that convert this 
      immunosuppressive cytokine into a potent T-cell stimulant. However, clinical 
      translation of TGF-beta CAR-T cells for cancer therapy requires the ability to 
      productively combine TGF-beta responsiveness with tumor-targeting specificity. 
      Furthermore, the potential concern that contaminating, TGF-beta?producing regulatory 
      T (Treg) cells may preferentially expand during TGF-beta CAR-T cell manufacturing 
      and suppress effector T (Teff) cells demands careful evaluation. Here, we 
      demonstrate that TGF-beta CAR-T cells significantly improve the anti-tumor efficacy 
      of neighboring cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, the introduction of TGF-beta CARs 
      into mixed T-cell populations does not result in the preferential expansion of 
      Treg cells, nor do TGF-beta CAR-Treg cells cause CAR-mediated suppression of Teff 
      cells. These results support the utility of incorporating TGF-beta CARs in the 
      development of adoptive T-cell therapy for cancer.

AB  - Adverse remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) is strongly influenced by T 
      cells. Stem cell therapy after MI, using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) or 
      cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPC), improved cardiac function, despite low 
      cell retention and limited differentiation. As MSC secrete many factors affecting 
      T cell proliferation and function, we hypothesized the immune response could be 
      affected as one of the targets of stem cell therapy. Therefore, we studied the 
      immunosuppressive properties of human BM-MSC and CMPC and their extracellular 
      vesicles (EVs) in co-culture with activated T cells. Proliferation of T cells, 
      measured by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution, was significantly 
      reduced in the presence of BM-MSC and CMPC. The inflammatory cytokine panel of 
      the T cells in co-culture, measured by Luminex assay, changed, with strong 
      downregulation of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The effect on proliferation was 
      observed in both direct cell contact and transwell co-culture systems. Transfer 
      of conditioned medium to unrelated T cells abrogated proliferation in these 
      cells. EVs isolated from the conditioned medium of BM-MSC and CMPC prevented T 
      cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Progenitor cells presence induces 
      up- and downregulation of multiple previously unreported pathways in T cells. In 
      conclusion, both BM-MSC and CMPC have a strong capacity for in vitro 
      immunosuppression. This effect is mediated by paracrine factors, such as 
      extracellular vesicles. Besides proliferation, many additional pathways are 
      influenced by both BM-MSC and CMPC.

AB  - Considerable advances have been made toward understanding the cellular and 
      molecular mechanism of wound healing, however, treatments for chronic wounds 
      remain elusive. Emerging concepts utilizing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from 
      umbilical cord, adipose tissue and bone marrow have shown therapeutical 
      advantages for wound healing. Based on this positive outcome, efforts to 
      determine the optimal sources for MSCs are required in order to improve their 
      migratory, angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and reparative abilities. An alternative 
      source suitable for repetitive, non-invasive collection of MSCs is from the 
      menstrual fluid (MenSCs), displaying a major practical advantage over other 
      sources. This study aims to compare the biological functions and the 
      transcriptomic pattern of MenSCs with umbilical cord MSCs in conditions 
      resembling the wound microenvironment. Consequently, we correlate the specific 
      gene expression signature from MenSCs with changes of the wound matrix signals in 
      vivo. The direct comparison revealed a superior clonogenic and migratory 
      potential of MenSCs as well as a beneficial effect of their secretome on human 
      dermal fibroblast migration in vitro. Furthermore, MenSCs showed increased 
      immunomodulatory properties, inhibiting T-cell proliferation in co-culture. We 
      further, investigated the expression of selected genes involved in wound repair 
      (growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, AMPs, MMPs) and found considerably higher 
      expression levels in MenSCs (ANGPT1 1.5-fold; PDGFA 1.8-fold; PDGFB 791-fold; 
      MMP3 21.6-fold; ELN 13.4-fold; and MMP10 9.2-fold). This difference became more 
      pronounced under a pro-inflammatory stimulation, resembling wound bed conditions. 
      Locally applied in a murine excisional wound splinting model, MenSCs showed a 
      significantly improved wound closure after 14 days, as well as enhanced 
      neovascularization, compared to the untreated group. Interestingly, analysis of 
      excised wound tissue revealed a significantly higher expression of VEGF 
      (1.42-fold) among other factors, translating an important conversion of the 
      matrix signals in the wound site. Furthermore, histological analysis of the wound 
      tissue from MenSCs-treated group displayed a more mature robust vascular network 
      and a genuinely higher collagen content confirming the pro-angiogenic and 
      reparative effect of MenSCs treatment. In conclusion, the superior clonogenicity, 
      immunosuppressive and migration potential in combination with specific paracrine 
      signature of MenSCs, resulted in an enhanced wound healing and cutaneous 
      regeneration process.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC)-mediated endochondral bone formation may be a 
      promising alternative to the current gold standards of autologous bone 
      transplantation, in the development of novel methods for bone repair. 
      Implantation of chondrogenically differentiated BMSCs leads to bone formation in 
      vivo via endochondral ossification. The success of this bone formation in an 
      allogeneic system depends upon the interaction between the implanted constructs 
      and the host immune system. The current study investigated the effect of 
      chondrogenically differentiated human bone marrow stromal cell (hBMSC) pellets on 
      the maturation and function of dendritic cells (DCs) by directly coculturing bone 
      forming chondrogenic hBMSC pellets and immature or lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS)-matured DCs in vitro. Allogeneic chondrogenic hBMSC pellets did not affect 
      the expression of CD80, CD86, or HLADR on immature or LPS-matured DCs following 
      24, 48, or 72 hr of coculture. Furthermore, they did not induce or inhibit 
      antigen uptake or migration of the DCs over time. IL-6 was secreted by allogeneic 
      chondrogenic hBMSC pellets in response to LPS-matured DCs. Overall, this study 
      has demonstrated that maturation of immature DCs was not influenced by allogeneic 
      chondrogenic hBMSC pellets. This suggests that allogeneic chondrogenic hBMSC 
      pellets do not stimulate immunogenic responses from DCs in vitro and are not 
      expected to indirectly activate T cells via DCs. For this reason, allogeneic 
      chondrogenic bone marrow stromal cell pellets are promising candidates for future 
      tissue engineering strategies utilising allogeneic cells for bone repair.

TI  - Towards a Novel Patch Material for Cardiac Applications: Tissue-Specific 
      Extracellular Matrix Introduces Essential Key Features to Decellularized Amniotic 
      Membrane.

AB  - There is a growing need for scaffold material with tissue-specific bioactivity 
      for use in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, and for surgical repair of 
      structural defects. We developed a novel composite biomaterial by processing 
      human cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) into a hydrogel and combining it with 
      cell-free amniotic membrane via a dry-coating procedure. Cardiac biocompatibility 
      and immunogenicity were tested in vitro using human cardiac fibroblasts, 
      epicardial progenitor cells, murine HL-1 cells, and human immune cells derived 
      from buffy coat. Processing of the ECM preserved important matrix proteins as 
      demonstrated by mass spectrometry. ECM coating did not alter the mechanical 
      characteristics of decellularized amniotic membrane but did cause a clear 
      increase in adhesion capacity, cell proliferation and viability. Activated 
      monocytes secreted less pro-inflammatory cytokines, and both macrophage 
      polarization towards the pro-inflammatory M1 type and T cell proliferation were 
      prevented. We conclude that the incorporation of human cardiac ECM hydrogel 
      shifts and enhances the bioactivity of decellularized amniotic membrane, 
      facilitating its use in future cardiac applications.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease caused by a 
      dysregulated immune response to intestinal microbes in an individual with a 
      genetic predisposition. Therefore, alleviation of inflammation is very important 
      to treat IBD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been highlighted as new 
      candidates for treating autoimmune disease based on their immunomodulatory 
      properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism and 
      therapeutic effects of adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) using THP-1 macrophages 
      and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mice with chronic colitis. LPS-treated 
      THP-1 cells expressed mRNA of CD11b, an M1 macrophage marker, at day 2. However, 
      THP-1 co-cultured with ASCs expressed mRNA of CD206, CD68, CCL18, legumain, and 
      IL-10, markers of M2 macrophages. In THP-1 cells co-cultured with ASCs, precursor 
      (pro)-IL-1beta, Cox-2, and NLRP3 increased dramatically compared to LPS-treated 
      THP-1 cells. Secretion of IL-1beta and IL-18 was significantly inhibited by ASCs, 
      but PGE2 production was highly increased in co-culture conditions of THP-1 and 
      ASCs. IL-18 secretion was inhibited by PGE2 treatment, and PGE2 inhibited 
      inflammasome complex (ASC/Cas-1/NLRP3) formation in THP-1 cells. In the 
      DSS-induced chronic colitis model, ASCs ameliorated colitis by decreasing the 
      total number of macrophages and the M1 macrophage population. Our results suggest 
      that ASCs can suppress the inflammatory response by controlling the macrophage 
      population, and ASCs may be therapeutically useful for the treatment of IBD.

TI  - In vitro induction of T regulatory cells by a methylated CpG DNA sequence in 
      humans: Potential therapeutic applications in allergic and autoimmune diseases.
PG  - 143-152
LID - 10.2500/aap.2018.39.4113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allergic and autoimmune diseases comprise a group of inflammatory 
      disorders caused by aberrant immune responses in which CD25+ Forkhead box 
      P3-positive (FOXP3+) T regulatory (Treg) cells that normally suppress 
      inflammatory events are often poorly functioning. This has stimulated an 
      intensive investigative effort to find ways of increasing Tregs as a method of 
      therapy for these conditions. One such line of investigation includes the study 
      of how ligation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) 
      results in an immunostimulatory cascade that leads to induction of T-helper (Th) 
      type 1 and Treg-type immune responses. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated 
      the mechanisms by which calf thymus mammalian double-stranded DNA (CT-DNA) and a 
      synthetic methylated DNA CpG ODN sequence suppress in vitro lymphoproliferative 
      responses to antigens, mitogens, and alloantigens when measured by [3H]-thymidine 
      incorporation and promote FoxP3 expression in human CD4+ T cells in the presence 
      of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta and interleukin-2 (IL-2). METHODS: 
      Lymphoproliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four 
      healthy subjects or nine subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus to CT-DNA or 
      phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was measured by tritiated thymidine ([3H]-TdR) 
      incorporation expressed as a stimulation index. Mechanisms of immunosuppressive 
      effects of CT-DNA were evaluated by measurement of the degree of inhibition to 
      lymphoproliferative responses to streptokinase-streptodornase, phytohemagglutinin 
      (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), pokeweed mitogen (PWM), or alloantigens by a Con A 
      suppressor assay. The effects of CpG methylation on induction of FoxP3 expression 
      in human T cells were measured by comparing inhibitory responses of synthetic 
      methylated and nonmethylated 8-mer CpG ODN sequences by using cell sorting, in 
      vitro stimulation, and suppressor assay. RESULTS: Here, we showed that CT-DNA and 
      a synthetic methylated DNA 8-mer sequence could suppress antigen-, mitogen-, and 
      alloantigen-induced lymphoproliferation in vitro when measured by [3H]-thymidine. 
      The synthetic methylated DNA CpG ODN but not an unmethylated CpG ODN sequence was 
      shown to promote FoxP3 expression in human CD4+ T cells in the presence of TGF 
      beta and IL-2. The induction of FoxP3+ suppressor cells is dose dependent and 
      offers a potential clinical therapeutic application in allergic and autoimmune 
      and inflammatory diseases. CONCLUSION: The use of this methylated CpG ODN offers 
      a broad clinical application as a novel therapeutic method for Treg induction 
      and, because of its low cost and small size, should facilitate delivery via 
      nasal, respiratory, gastrointestinal routes, and/or by injection, routes of 
      administration important for vaccine delivery to target sites responsible for 
      respiratory, gastrointestinal, and systemic forms of allergic and autoimmune 
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic autoimmunity can be present years before clinical onset of 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Adaptive immunity is initiated in lymphoid tissue 
      where lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) regulate immune responses through their 
      intimate connection with leucocytes. We postulate that malfunctioning of LNSCs 
      creates a microenvironment in which normal immune responses are not properly 
      controlled, possibly leading to autoimmune disease. In this study we established 
      an experimental model for studying the functional capacities of human LNSCs 
      during RA development. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with RA, 23 individuals 
      positive for autoantibodies but without clinical disease (RA risk group) and 14 
      seronegative healthy control subjects underwent ultrasound-guided inguinal lymph 
      node (LN) biopsy. Human LNSCs were isolated and expanded in vitro for functional 
      analyses. In analogous co-cultures consisting of LNSCs and peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells, alphaCD3/alphaCD28-induced T-cell proliferation was measured using 
      carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester dilution. RESULTS: 
      Fibroblast-like cells expanded from the LN biopsy comprised of fibroblastic 
      reticular cells (gp38(+)CD31(-)) and double-negative (gp38(-)CD31(-)) cells. 
      Cultured LNSCs stably expressed characteristic adhesion molecules and cytokines. 
      Basal expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) was lower in LNSCs 
      from RA risk individuals than in those from healthy control subjects. Key LN 
      chemokines C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL19), CCL21 and CXCL13 were induced in 
      LNSCs upon stimulation with tumour necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin alpha(1)beta(2), 
      but to a lesser extent in LNSCs from patients with RA. The effect of human LNSCs 
      on T-cell proliferation was ratio-dependent and altered in RA LNSCs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, we developed an experimental model to facilitate research on the role of 
      LNSCs during the earliest phases of RA. Using this innovative model, we show, for 
      the first time to our knowledge, that the LN stromal environment is changed 
      during the earliest phases of RA, probably contributing to deregulated immune 
      responses early in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Tumor escapes host immune responses by producing immunosuppressive cytokines, 
      such as IL-10 and TGF-beta, secreted into the tumor microenvironment. These 
      cytokines play important roles in the suppression of dendritic cell (DC) 
      function, leading to decreased immune responses of the effector CD4(+) and CD8(+) 
      T cells. To improve DC functions and enhance cytolytic activity of activated 
      effector T-cells, we suppressed the effect of these cytokines on DCs by using 
      specific neutralizing antibodies that inhibit IL-10 and TGF-beta receptors. 
      Monocyte-derived DCs generated in vitro showed up-regulation of MHC (HLA-DR) and 
      co-stimulatory molecules (CD40 and CD86). The IL-10 and TGF-beta receptors were 
      expressed and localized on cell membrane of DCs, as shown by Western blot 
      analysis and immunofluorescence staining, whereas the IL-10 and TGF-beta ligands 
      were detected in the culture supernatants of DCs and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) 
      cell line, respectively. Inhibition of the IL-10 and TGF-beta receptors on DCs by 
      specific neutralizing antibodies significantly increased level of IFN-gamma and 
      enhanced cytolytic activity of the DC-activated effector T-cells against CCA cell 
      line. These results indicate that the IL-10 and TGF-beta receptors are the targets 
      for inhibition to increase DC functions and enhance cytolytic activity of the 
      DC-activated effector T-cells against CCA cells. Thus, inhibition of the IL-10 
      and TGF-beta receptors on DCs is crucial in the preparation of DC-activated effector 
      T cells for adoptive T-cell therapy.

      immunogenic.
PG  - 729-740
LID - 10.1038/s41409-018-0108-6 [doi]
AB  - For hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) HLA 10/10 (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, 
      DQB1) matched donors are optimal, but are not available for all patients. The 
      identification of permissive/non-immunogenic mismatches may improve the outcome 
      of HLA mismatched transplants. We hypothesize that HLA alleles identical within 
      the antigen recognition domain (ARD), but mismatched outside the peptide binding 
      groove or alpha-helices are often permissive mismatches. We evaluated the functional 
      impact of non-ARD mismatches by performing in vitro functional T cell assays. 
      Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte precursor assays were performed for 23 HLA class I 
      mismatches and 96% (22 out of 23) were negative. Mixed lymphocyte reaction assays 
      were conducted on 10 HLA class II mismatches and all were negative. However, 4 
      out of 10 combinations were positive in the Elispot and all involved one 
      direction: a DRB1*14:01/DRB3*02:01 responder against a DRB1*14:54/DRB3*02:02 
      stimulator. These positive responses were confirmed by Primed Lymphocyte Testing 
      and the DRB1* mismatch seemed to be responsible for the response. In conclusion, 
      HLA mismatches with amino-acid differences outside the ARD are not very 
      immunogenic. However, in some cases weak T cell reactivity in vitro can be 
      observed. The impact of these responses on clinical outcome of HCT remains to be 
      established.

AB  - The use of tolerance-inducing dendritic cells (tolDCs) has been proven to be safe 
      and well tolerated in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, several 
      challenges remain, including finding ways to facilitate the migration of cell 
      therapeutic products to lymph nodes, and the site of inflammation. In the 
      treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a major obstacle to the delivery of 
      therapeutic agents to the inflamed central nervous system (CNS). As it was 
      previously demonstrated that C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) may be involved in 
      inflammatory migration of DCs, the aim of this study was to investigate 
      CCR5-driven migration of tolDCs. Only a minority of in vitro generated vitamin 
      D(3) (vitD(3))-treated tolDCs expressed the inflammatory chemokine receptor CCR5. 
      Thus, messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding CCR5 was introduced by means of 
      electroporation (EP). After mRNA EP, tolDCs transiently displayed increased 
      levels of CCR5 protein expression. Accordingly, the capacity of mRNA 
      electroporated tolDCs to transmigrate toward a chemokine gradient in an in vitro 
      model of the BBB improved significantly. Neither the tolerogenic phenotype nor 
      the T cell-stimulatory function of tolDCs was affected by mRNA EP. EP of tolDCs 
      with mRNA encoding CCR5 enabled these cells to migrate to inflammatory sites. The 
      approach used herein has important implications for the treatment of MS. Using 
      this approach, tolDCs actively shuttle across the BBB, allowing in situ 
      down-modulation of autoimmune responses in the CNS.

AB  - Clinical use of multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC)-based medicinal 
      products requires their production in compliance with Good Manufacturing 
      Practices, thus ensuring that the final drug product meets specifications 
      consistently from batch to batch in terms of cell viability, identity, purity and 
      potency. Potency relates to the efficacy of the medicine in its target clinical 
      indication, so adequate release tests need to be defined and validated as quality 
      controls. Herein we report the design and optimisation of parameters affecting 
      the performance of an in vitro cell-based assay for assessing immunomodulatory 
      potential of clinical grade MSC for human use, based on their capacity to inhibit 
      proliferation of T lymphocytes under strong polyclonal stimuli. The resulting 
      method was demonstrated to be reproducible and relatively simple to execute. Two 
      case studies using clinical grade MSC are presented as examples to illustrate the 
      applicability of the methodology described in this work.

AB  - Immune complex (IC) deposition of IgG containing autologous antigens has been 
      observed in autoimmunity. This can lead to IC-mediated antigen uptake and 
      presentation by antigen presenting cells (APC) driving T cell dependent 
      inflammation. IgG receptors (FcgammaRs) have been suggested to be involved in this 
      process. Since ICs have been linked to autoimmune diseases, interfering with IC 
      mediated effects on APCs and subsequent autoimmune T cell activation via FcgammaR 
      blockade may be therapeutically beneficial. However, this is currently 
      challenging due to a lack of translatable animal models and specific human in 
      vitro assays to study IC-driven T cell responses. Here, we developed a simple 
      cellular assay to study IC-mediated T cell activation in vitro using human 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tetanus toxoid as a model antigen. We 
      observed that tetanus ICs led to a strong induction of T cell proliferation and 
      release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are hallmarks of chronic 
      inflammation. This process was exacerbated when compared to tetanus toxoid 
      challenge alone. IC-mediated T cell effects were FcgammaR dependent and inhibited by 
      high-dose intravenous IgG (IVIg), a drug often used for the clinical treatments 
      of autoimmune diseases. Similar effects were also seen using a hepatitis antigen. 
      Consequently, we propose our assay as a rapid yet robust alternative to more 
      labour-intense and time-consuming protocols, for example involving separate 
      maturation of dendritic cells followed by T cell co-culture to study antigen 
      specific primary T cell activation.

AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is 1 of the main major complications of 
      post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Identifying patients at risk 
      of severe aGVHD may lead to earlier intervention and treatment, resulting in 
      increased survival and a better quality of life. We aimed to identify biomarkers 
      in donor grafts and patient plasma around the time of transplantation that might 
      be predictive of aGVHD development. We build on our previously published methods 
      by using multiplex assays and multicolor flow cytometry. We identified 5 easily 
      assessable cellular markers in donor grafts that combined could potentially be 
      used to calculate risk for severe aGVHD development. Most noteworthy are the T 
      cell subsets expressing IL-7 receptor-alpha (CD127) and PD-1. Additionally, we 
      identified a potential role for elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in both 
      graft and patient before HSCT in development of aGVHD.

TI  - Cathepsin S inhibition suppresses autoimmune-triggered inflammatory responses in 
      macrophages.
PG  - 151-164

AB  - In several types of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), Cathepsin S (CatS) plays a 
      crucial role in the regulation of MHC class II surface expression and 
      consequently influences antigen (Ag) presentation of APCs to CD4(+) T cells. 
      During the assembly of MHC class II-Ag peptide complexes, CatS cleaves the 
      invariant chain p10 (Lip10) - a fragment of the MHC class II-associated invariant 
      chain peptide. In this report, we used a selective, high-affinity CatS inhibitor 
      to suppress the proteolytic activity of CatS in lymphoid and myeloid cells. CatS 
      inhibition resulted in a concentration-dependent Lip10 accumulation in B cells 
      from both healthy donors and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 
      Furthermore, CatS inhibition led to a decreased MHC class II expression on B 
      cells, monocytes, and proinflammatory macrophages. In SLE patient-derived 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CatS inhibition led to a suppressed secretion 
      of IL-6, TNFalpha, and IL-10. In a second step, we tested the effect of CatS 
      inhibition on macrophages being exposed to patient-derived autoantibodies against 
      C1q (anti-C1q) that are known to be associated with severe lupus nephritis. As 
      shown previously, those SLE patient-derived high-affinity anti-C1q bound to 
      immobilized C1q induce a proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages. Using this 
      human in vitro model of autoimmunity, we found that CatS inhibition reduces the 
      inflammatory responses of macrophages as demonstrated by a decreased secretion of 
      proinflammatory cytokines, the downregulation of MHC class II and CD80. In 
      summary, we can show that the used CatS inhibitor is able to block Lip10 
      degradation in healthy donor- and SLE patient-derived B cells and inhibits the 
      induction of proinflammatory macrophages. Thus, CatS inhibition seems to be a 
      promising future treatment of SLE.

TI  - Interaction of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived stromal cells and unstimulated 
      immune cells in vitro: the impact of cell-to-cell contact and hypoxia in the 
      local milieu.

AB  - Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive tool for cell therapy 
      and regenerative medicine. Being applied in vivo, allogeneic MSCs are faced with 
      both activated and unstimulated immune cells. The effects of MSCs on activated 
      immune cells are well described and are mainly suppressive. Less is known about 
      the interaction of MSCs with unstimulated immune cells. We evaluated the 
      contribution of tissue-related O(2) level ("physiological" hypoxia-5% O(2)) and 
      cell-to-cell contact to the interaction between allogeneic adipose tissue-derived 
      MSCs (ASCs) and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Under 
      both O(2) levels, ASCs affected the immune response by elevating the proportion 
      of CD69+ T cells and modifying the functional activity of unstimulated PBMCs, 
      providing a significant reduction of ROS level and activation of lysosome 
      compartment. "Physiological" hypoxia partially attenuated the ASC modulation of 
      PBMC function, reducing CD69+ cell activation and more significantly supressing 
      ROS. In direct co-culture, the ASC effects were more pronounced. PBMC viability 
      was preferentially maintained, and the lymphocyte subset ratio was altered in 
      favour of B cells. Our findings demonstrate that allogeneic ASCs do not enhance 
      the activation of unstimulated immune cells and can provide supportive functions. 
      The "hypoxic" phenotype of ASCs may be more "desirable" for the interaction with 
      allogeneic immune cells that may be required in cell therapy protocols.

      Inhibition for Cancer and Autoimmune Disease.

AB  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has both positive and negative roles in human 
      disease. In certain cancers, TNF-alpha is infused locally to promote tumor 
      regression, but dose-limiting inflammatory effects limit broader utility. In 
      autoimmune disease, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies control inflammation in most patients, 
      but these benefits are offset during chronic treatment. TAK1 acts as a key 
      mediator between survival and cell death in TNF-alpha-mediated signaling. Here, we 
      describe Takinib, a potent and selective TAK1 inhibitor that induces apoptosis 
      following TNF-alpha stimulation in cell models of rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic 
      breast cancer. We demonstrate that Takinib is an inhibitor of autophosphorylated 
      and non-phosphorylated TAK1 that binds within the ATP-binding pocket and inhibits 
      by slowing down the rate-limiting step of TAK1 activation. Overall, Takinib is an 
      attractive starting point for the development of inhibitors that sensitize cells 
      to TNF-alpha-induced cell death, with general implications for cancer and autoimmune 
      disease treatment.

TI  - RNA-transfection of gamma/delta T cells with a chimeric antigen receptor or an alpha/beta T-cell 
      receptor: a safer alternative to genetically engineered alpha/beta T cells for the 
      immunotherapy of melanoma.
PG  - 551

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adoptive T-cell therapy relying on conventional T cells transduced 
      with T-cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has caused 
      substantial tumor regression in several clinical trials. However, genetically 
      engineered T cells have been associated with serious side-effects due to 
      off-target toxicities and massive cytokine release. To obviate these concerns, we 
      established a protocol adaptable to GMP to expand and transiently transfect gamma/delta T 
      cells with mRNA. METHODS: PBMC from healthy donors were stimulated using 
      zoledronic-acid or OKT3 to expand gamma/delta T cells and bulk T cells, respectively. 
      Additionally, CD8(+) T cells and gamma/delta T cells were MACS-isolated from PBMC and 
      expanded with OKT3. Next, these four populations were electroporated with RNA 
      encoding a gp100/HLA-A2-specific TCR or a CAR specific for MCSP. Thereafter, 
      receptor expression, antigen-specific cytokine secretion, specific cytotoxicity, 
      and killing of the endogenous gamma/delta T cell-target Daudi were analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Using zoledronic-acid in average 6 million of gamma/delta T cells with a purity of 85% 
      were generated from one million PBMC. MACS-isolation and OKT3-mediated expansion 
      of gamma/delta T cells yielded approximately ten times less cells. OKT3-expanded and 
      CD8(+) MACS-isolated conventional T cells behaved correspondingly similar. All 
      employed T cells were efficiently transfected with the TCR or the CAR. Upon 
      respective stimulation, gamma/delta T cells produced IFNgamma and TNF, but little IL-2 and 
      the zoledronic-acid expanded T cells exceeded MACS-gamma/delta T cells in 
      antigen-specific cytokine secretion. While the cytokine production of gamma/delta T cells 
      was in general lower than that of conventional T cells, specific cytotoxicity 
      against melanoma cell lines was similar. In contrast to OKT3-expanded and 
      MACS-CD8(+) T cells, mock-electroporated gamma/delta T cells also lysed tumor cells 
      reflecting the gamma/delta T cell-intrinsic anti-tumor activity. After transfection, gamma/delta 
      T cells were still able to kill MHC-deficient Daudi cells. CONCLUSION: We present 
      a protocol adaptable to GMP for the expansion of gamma/delta T cells and their subsequent 
      RNA-transfection with tumor-specific TCRs or CARs. Given the transient receptor 
      expression, the reduced cytokine release, and the equivalent cytotoxicity, these 
      gamma/delta T cells may represent a safer complementation to genetically engineered 
      conventional T cells in the immunotherapy of melanoma (Exper Dermatol 26: 157, 
      2017, J Investig Dermatol 136: A173, 2016).

TI  - Modeling of TREX1-Dependent Autoimmune Disease using Human Stem Cells Highlights 
      L1 Accumulation as a Source of Neuroinflammation.

AB  - Three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an anti-viral enzyme that cleaves 
      nucleic acids in the cytosol, preventing accumulation and a subsequent type I 
      interferon-associated inflammatory response. Autoimmune diseases, including 
      Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) and systemic lupus erythematosus, can arise when 
      TREX1 function is compromised. AGS is a neuroinflammatory disorder with severe 
      and persistent intellectual and physical problems. Here we generated a human AGS 
      model that recapitulates disease-relevant phenotypes using pluripotent stem cells 
      lacking TREX1. We observed abundant extrachromosomal DNA in TREX1-deficient 
      neural cells, of which endogenous Long Interspersed Element-1 retrotransposons 
      were a major source. TREX1-deficient neurons also exhibited increased apoptosis 
      and formed three-dimensional cortical organoids of reduced size. TREX1-deficient 
      astrocytes further contributed to the observed neurotoxicity through increased 
      type I interferon secretion. In this model, reverse-transcriptase inhibitors 
      rescued the neurotoxicity of AGS neurons and organoids, highlighting their 
      potential utility in therapeutic regimens for AGS and related disorders.

AB  - Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) exhibit immunomodulatory effects 
      on T cell response. WJ-MSC are easy to collect, process, and proliferate rapidly 
      in culture, but information on the variability of individual cell samples 
      impacting upon in vitro expansion, immunomodulatory potential, and aging 
      processes is still lacking. We propose to evaluate the immunomodulatory cytokine 
      profile and capacity to inhibit T cell proliferation of WJ-MSC progressing to 
      replicative senescence in order to analyze if expected responses are affected. 
      Our results show that the gene expression of immunomodulatory molecules varied 
      among samples with no specific pattern present. In coculture, all WJ-MSC were 
      capable of inhibiting mitogen-activated CD3(+) T cell proliferation, although to 
      different degrees, and each PBMC responded with a different level of inhibition. 
      Thus, we suggest that each WJ-MSC displays unique behavior, differing in patterns 
      of cytokine mRNA expression and immunomodulatory capacity. We believe that 
      variability between samples may play a role in the effectiveness of WJ-MSC 
      employed therapeutically.

TI  - Autoimmunity to Vimentin Is Associated with Outcomes of Patients with Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 1596-1605
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1700473 [doi]
AB  - Autoimmunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF); however, the repertoire of autoantigens involved in this disease 
      and the clinical relevance of these autoimmune responses are still being 
      explored. Our initial discovery assays demonstrated that circulating and 
      intrapulmonary vimentin levels are increased in IPF patients. Subsequent studies 
      showed native vimentin induced HLA-DR-dependent in vitro proliferation of CD4 T 
      cells from IPF patients and enhanced the production of IL-4, IL-17, and TGF-beta1 by 
      these lymphocytes in contrast to normal control specimens. Vimentin 
      supplementation of IPF PBMC cultures also resulted in HLA-DR-dependent production 
      of IgG with anti-vimentin specificities. Circulating anti-vimentin IgG 
      autoantibody levels were much greater in IPF subjects from the University of 
      Alabama at Birmingham (n = 102) and the University of Pittsburgh (U. Pitt., n = 
      70) than in normal controls. Anti-vimentin autoantibody levels in IPF patients 
      were HLA biased and inversely correlated with physiological measurements of lung 
      function (i.e., forced expiratory volumes and diffusing capacities). Despite 
      considerable intergroup differences in transplant-free survival between these two 
      independent IPF cohorts, serious adverse outcomes were most frequent among the 
      patients within each population that had the highest anti-vimentin autoantibody 
      levels (University of Alabama at Birmingham: hazard ratio 2.5, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.2-5.3, p = 0.012; University of Pittsburgh: hazard ratio 2.7, 95% 
      confidence interval 1.3-5.5, p = 0.006). These data show that anti-vimentin 
      autoreactivity is prevalent in IPF patients and is strongly associated with 
      disease manifestations. These findings have implications with regard to the 
      pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease and raise the possibility that therapies 
      specifically directed at these autoimmune processes could have therapeutic 
      efficacy.

TI  - Human limbal fibroblast-like stem cells induce immune-tolerance in autoreactive T 
      lymphocytes from female patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
PG  - 154

LID - 154
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to their "natural immune privilege" and immunoregulatory 
      properties human fibroblast-like limbal stem cells (f-LSCs) have acquired great 
      interest as a potential tool for achieving immunotolerance. Hashimoto's 
      thyroiditis (HT) is the most common thyroid autoimmune disease and cause of 
      hypothyroidism. To date, conventional hormone replacement therapy and unspecific 
      immunosuppressive regimens cannot provide a definitive cure for HT subjects. We 
      explored the immunosuppressant potential of human f-LSCs on circulating 
      lymphomonocytes (PBMCs) collected from healthy donors and female HT patients. 
      METHODS: We assessed the immunophenotyping of f-LSCs, both untreated and after 
      48 h of proinflammatory cytokine exposure, by means of quantitative 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and flow cytometry. The 
      immunosuppressant effects of f-LSCs on healthy activated PBMCs were investigated 
      in cell-cell contact and transwell settings through cell cycle assay, acridine 
      orange staining, and caspase-3 detection. We also studied T-cell responses and 
      possible Treg conversion by means of flow cytometry. Functional assays were 
      conducted in activated HT lymphocytes cocultured with f-LSCs after 
      carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labeling and intracellular detection of 
      pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: The hypo-immunogenicity of the 
      f-LSC population depended on both cell contact and soluble factors produced, as 
      well as the undetectable expression of all those molecules required to fully 
      activate T lymphocytes. Following exposure to Th1 cytokines, f-LSCs augmented 
      expression of programmed death-ligand 1 and 2 (PDL-1 and -2), 
      indoleamine-pyrrole-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), interleukin (IL)-6, and monocyte 
      chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) while maintaining their negative phenotype for 
      major histocompatibility (MHC) class II and costimulatory molecules. During 
      coculture, f-LSCs suppressed up to 40% of proliferation in healthy activated 
      PBMCs, arrested them in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase without inducing apoptosis 
      cascade, inverted the CD4/CD8 ratio, and promoted sustained expression of the 
      immunomodulator marker CD69. Under coculture conditions the Th imbalance of 
      autoreactive T cells from female HT patients was fully restored. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study describes an in vitro coculture system able to prevent inappropriate 
      activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes of female HT patients and to generate a 
      tolerogenic environment even in an inflammatory background. Further 
      investigations are necessary to establish whether this stem cell-based therapy 
      approach in HT could avoid lifetime hormone replacement therapy by inducing

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) possess immunomodulatory properties 
      and low immunogenicity, both crucial properties for their development into an 
      effective cellular immunotherapy. They have shown benefit in clinical trials 
      targeting liver diseases; however the efficacy of MSC therapy will benefit from 
      improvement of the immunomodulatory and immunogenic properties of MSC. METHODS: 
      MSC derived from human umbilical cords (ucMSC) were treated for 3 days in vitro 
      with various inflammatory factors, interleukins, vitamins and serum deprivation. 
      Their immunogenicity and immunomodulatory capacity were examined by 
      gene-expression analysis, surface-marker expressions, IDO activity, PGE(2) 
      secretion and inhibition of T cell proliferation and IFNgamma production. 
      Furthermore, their activation of NK cell cytotoxicity was investigated via CD107a 
      expression on NK cells. The immunomodulatory capacity, biodistribution and 
      survival of pre-treated ucMSC were investigated in a CCl(4)-induced liver disease 
      mouse model. In addition, capacity of pre-treated MSC to ameliorate liver 
      inflammation was examined in an ex vivo liver inflammation co-culture model. 
      RESULTS: IFN-gamma and a multiple cytokine cocktail (MC) consisting of IFN-gamma, TGFbeta 
      and retinoic acid upregulated the expression of immunomodulatory factor PD-L1 and 
      IDO activity. Subsequently, both treatments enhanced the capacity of ucMSC to 
      inhibit CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production. The susceptibility 
      of ucMSC for NK cell lysis was decreased by IFN-beta, TGFbeta and MC treatment. In 
      vivo, no immunomodulation was observed by the ucMSC. Four hours after intravenous 
      infusion in mice with CCl(4)-induced inflammatory liver injury, the majority of 
      ucMSC were trapped in the lungs. Rapid clearance of ucMSC(VitB(6)), 
      ucMSC(Starv + VitB(6)) and ucMSC(MC) and altered bio-distribution of ucMSC(TGFbeta) 
      compared to untreated ucMSC was observed. In the ex vivo co-culture system with 
      inflammatory liver slices ucMSC(MC) showed significantly enhanced modulatory 
      capacity compared to untreated ucMSC. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates 
      the responsiveness of ucMSC to in vitro optimisation treatment. The observed 
      improvements in immunomodulatory capacity as well as immunogenicity after MC 
      treatment may improve the efficacy of ucMSC as immunotherapy targeted towards 
      liver inflammation.

AB  - The application of autologous endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) transplantation 
      is a promising approach in therapeutic cardiovascular diseases and ischemic 
      diseases. In this study, we compared the immunogenicity of EPCs, adipose tissue 
      (AD)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSCs 
      by flow cytometry and the mixed lymphocyte reaction. The impact of AD-MSCs and 
      UC-MSCs on the immunogenicity of EPCs was analyzed by the mixed lymphocyte 
      reaction and cytokine secretion in vitro and was further tested by allogenic 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) induced immuno-rejection on a 
      cell/matrigel graft in an SCID mouse model. EPCs and AD-MSCs express higher 
      levels of MHC class I than UC-MSCs. All three kinds of cells are negative for MHC 
      class II. UC-MSCs also express lower levels of IFN-gamma receptor mRNA when compared 
      with EPCs and AD-MSCs. EPCs can stimulate higher rates of proliferation of 
      lymphocytes than AD-MSCs and UC-MSCs. Furthermore, AD-MSCs and UC-MSCs can 
      modulate immune response and inhibit lymphocyte proliferation induced by EPCs, 
      mainly through inhibition of the proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Compared with 
      UC-MSCs, AD-MSCs can significantly improve vessel formation and maintain the 
      integrity of neovascular structure in an EPC+MSC/matrigel graft in SCID mice, 
      especially under allo-PBMC induced immuno-rejection. In conclusion, our study 
      shows that AD-MSC is a powerful candidate to minimize immunological rejection and 
      improve vessel formation in EPC transplantation treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Invossa (TissueGene-C) is a cell and gene therapy for 
      osteoarthritis. It is composed of primary human chondrocytes (hChonJ cells) and 
      irradiated human chondrocytes modified to express TGF-beta1 (hChonJb#7 cells). The 
      hChonJ cells were isolated from a polydactyly donor, and TGF-beta1 cDNA was 
      delivered to the cells, generating hChonJb#7 cells. Since the cells are 
      allogeneic, the concern of immune response against cells has been raised. In this 
      study, we investigated the immunogenicity of allogenic human chondrocyte, hChonJ 
      cells. METHODS: The immunological properties of hChonJ cells were investigated 
      through the analysis of surface marker expression and the effect on allogeneic T 
      cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and RT-PCR analysis were performed to analyze 
      the surface marker expression related to immune response, such as major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, class II, T cell co-stimulatory 
      molecules and T cell co-inhibitory molecules. A mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) 
      was conducted to evaluate how allogeneic T cells would respond to hChonJ cells. 
      RESULTS: We observed that hChonJ cells did not express MHC class II and T cell 
      co-stimulatory molecules, but expressed T cell co-inhibitory molecule PD-L2. 
      IFN-gamma treatment induced the expression of PD-L1, and up-regulated the expression 
      of PD-L2. Also, we observed that hChonJ cells did not stimulate T cell 
      proliferation from a MHC-mismatched donor. Further, they could suppress the 
      proliferation of activated T cells. We also observed that the blockade of PD-L1 
      and/or PD-L2 with specific neutralizing antibody could lead to the restoration of 
      allo-reactive T cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that hChonJ cells were 
      not immunogenic but immunosuppressive, and that this phenomenon was mediated by 
      co-inhibitory molecules PD-L1 and PD-L2 on hChonJ cells in a contact-dependent 
      manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting CD19 
      has demonstrated remarkable success in targeting B-cell malignancies but is often 
      complicated by serious systemic toxicity in the form of cytokine release syndrome 
      (CRS). CRS symptoms are primarily mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6), and clinical 
      management has focused on inhibition of IL-6 signaling. The cellular source and 
      function of IL-6 in CRS remain unknown. METHODS: Using co-culture assays and data 
      from patients on our clinical CAR T-cell trials, we investigated the cellular 
      source of IL-6, as well as other CRS-associated cytokines, during CAR T-cell 
      activation. We also explored the effect that IL-6 has on T-cell function. 
      RESULTS: We demonstrated that IL-6 is secreted by monocyte-lineage cells in 
      response to CAR T-cell activation in a contact-independent mechanism upon T-cell 
      engagement of target leukemia. We observed that the presence of 
      antigen-presenting cell-derived IL-6 has no impact on CAR T-cell transcriptional 
      profiles or cytotoxicity. Finally, we confirm that CAR T cells do not secrete 
      IL-6 in vivo during clinical CRS. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that IL-6 
      blockade will not affect CD19 CAR T-cell-driven anti-leukemic cytotoxicity, 
      permitting enhanced control of CRS while maintaining CAR T-cell efficacy.

AB  - Polymorphisms in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes can cause the 
      rejection of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived products in allogeneic 
      recipients. Disruption of the Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) gene eliminates surface 
      expression of all class I molecules, but leaves the cells vulnerable to lysis by 
      natural killer (NK) cells. Here we show that this 'missing-self' response can be 
      prevented by forced expression of minimally polymorphic HLA-E molecules. We use 
      adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene editing to knock in HLA-E genes at the 
      B2M locus in human PSCs in a manner that confers inducible, regulated, surface 
      expression of HLA-E single-chain dimers (fused to B2M) or trimers (fused to B2M 
      and a peptide antigen), without surface expression of HLA-A, B or C. These 
      HLA-engineered PSCs and their differentiated derivatives are not recognized as 
      allogeneic by CD8(+) T cells, do not bind anti-HLA antibodies and are resistant 
      to NK-mediated lysis. Our approach provides a potential source of universal donor 
      cells for applications where the differentiated derivatives lack HLA class II 
      expression.

AB  - AIM: Progressive ischemia due to peripheral artery disease causes muscle damage 
      and reduced strength of the lower extremities. Autologous cell therapy is an 
      attractive treatment to restore perfusion and improve muscle function. 
      Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have therapeutic potential in tissue repair, 
      including polarizing effects on macrophages (MPs). MATERIALS & METHODS: 
      Co-culture systems of ASCs and MPs were analyzed for gene and protein expression 
      modifications in ASC-conditioned MPs. Co-transplantation of MPs/ASCs in vivo led 
      to improved skeletal muscle regeneration in a mouse model of peripheral artery 
      disease. RESULTS: ASCs/MPs therapy restored muscle function, increased perfusion 
      and reduced inflammatory infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Combined MPs/ASCs cell therapy 
      is a promising approach to restore muscle function and stimulate local 
      angiogenesis in the ischemic limb.

TI  - Evidence for a role of eosinophils in blister formation in bullous pemphigoid.
PG  - 1105-1113
LID - 10.1111/all.13131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune bullous disease of the skin 
      characterized by subepidermal blister formation due to tissue-bound and 
      circulating autoantibodies to the hemidesmosomal antigens BP180 and BP230. 
      Although eosinophils and their toxic mediators are found abundantly in BP 
      lesions, their role in blister formation has remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of BP with a specific 
      focus on blister formation and to define conditions inducing dermal-epidermal 
      separation (DES). METHODS: In an ex vivo human model of BP, normal human skin 
      cryosections were incubated with purified human peripheral blood eosinophils with 
      or without activation in the presence or absence of BP autoantibodies, brefeldin 
      A, diphenyleneiodonium, DNase or blocking F(ab')(2) fragments to CD16, CD18, CD32 
      and CD64. Dermal-epidermal separation was assessed by light microscopy studies 
      and quantified using Fiji software. RESULTS: Following activation with IL-5 and 
      in the presence of BP autoantibodies, eosinophils induced separation along the 
      dermal-epidermal junction of ex vivo skin. Dermal-epidermal separation was 
      significantly reduced by blocking any of the following: Fcgamma receptor binding (P = 
      0.048), eosinophil adhesion (P = 0.046), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
      (P = 0.002), degranulation (P < 0.0001) or eosinophil extracellular trap (EET) 
      formation (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that 
      IL-5-activated eosinophils directly contribute to BP blister formation in the 
      presence of BP autoantibodies. Dermal-epidermal separation by IL-5-activated 
      eosinophils depends on adhesion and Fcgamma receptor activation, requires elevated 
      ROS production and degranulation and involves EET formation. Thus, targeting 
      eosinophils may be a promising therapeutic approach for BP.

AB  - To achieve the goal of a first-in-human trial for human induced pluripotent stem 
      cell (hiPSC)-based transplantation for the treatment of various diseases, 
      allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched hiPSC cell banks represent a 
      realistic tool from the perspective of quality control and cost performance. 
      Furthermore, considering the limited therapeutic time-window for acute injuries, 
      including neurotraumatic injuries, an iPS cell bank is of potential interest. 
      However, due to the relatively immunoprivileged environment of the central 
      nervous system, it is unclear whether HLA matching is required in hiPSC-derived 
      neural stem/progenitor cell (hiPSC-NS/PC) transplantation for the treatment of 
      neurodegenerative diseases and neurotraumatic injuries. In this study, we 
      evaluated the significance of HLA matching in hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation by 
      performing modified mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays with hiPSC-NS/PCs. 
      Compared to fetus-derived NS/PCs, the expression levels of human leukocyte 
      antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR) and co-stimulatory molecules on hiPSC-NS/PCs 
      were significantly low, even with the addition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) 
      and/or interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) to mimic the inflammatory environment surrounding 
      transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs in injured tissues. Interestingly, both the allogeneic 
      HLA-matched and the HLA-mismatched responses were similarly low in the modified 
      MLR assay. Furthermore, the autologous response was also similar to the 
      allogeneic response. hiPSC-NS/PCs suppressed the proliferative responses of 
      allogeneic HLA-mismatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Thus, the low antigen-presenting function and 
      immunosuppressive effects of hiPSC-NS/PCs result in a depressed immune response, 
      even in an allogeneic HLA-mismatched setting. It is crucial to verify whether 
      these in vitro results are reproducible in a clinical setting.

TI  - Allorecognition of HLA-C Mismatches by CD8(+) T Cells in Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
      Transplantation Is a Complex Interplay between Mismatched Peptide-Binding Region 
      Residues, HLA-C Expression, and HLA-DPB1 Disparities.

AB  - HLA-C locus mismatches (MMs) are the most frequent class I disparities in 
      unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and have a detrimental 
      impact on clinical outcome. Recently, a few retrospective clinical studies have 
      reported some variability in the immunogenicity of HLA-C incompatibilities. To 
      get better insight into presumably permissive HLA-C MMs, we have developed a 
      one-way in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay allowing to quantify 
      activated CD56(-)CD137(+)CD8(+) lymphocytes in HLA-C incompatible combinations. T 
      cell-mediated alloresponses were correlated with genetic markers such as HLA-C 
      mRNA expression and the number of amino acid (aa) MMs in the alpha1/alpha2 domains 
      (peptide-binding region). Because of the high rate of HLA-DPB1 incompatibilities 
      in HLA-A-, B-, C-, DRB1-, and DQB1-matched unrelated HSCT patient/donor pairs, 
      the impact of HLA-DPB1 mismatching, a potential bystander of CD4(+) T cell 
      activation, was also considered. Heterogeneous alloresponses were measured in 63 
      HLA-C-mismatched pairs with a positive assay in 52% of the combinations 
      (2.3-18.6% activated CTLs), representing 24 different HLA-A~B~DRB1~DQB1 
      haplotypes. There was no correlation between measured alloresponses and mRNA 
      expression of the mismatched HLA-C alleles. The HLA-C*03:03/03:04 MM did not 
      induce any positive alloresponse in five MLRs. We also identified HLA-C*02:02 and 
      HLA-C*06:02 as mismatched alleles with lower immunogenicity, and HLA-C*14:02 as a 
      more immunogenic MM. A difference of at least 10 aa residues known to impact 
      peptide/T cell receptor (TCR) binding and a bystander HLA-DPB1 incompatibility 
      had a significant impact on CTL alloreactivity (p = 0.021). The same HLA-C MM, 
      when recognized by two different responders with the same HLA haplotypes, was 
      recognized differently, emphasizing the role of the T-cell repertoire of 
      responding cells. In conclusion, mismatched HLA-C alleles differing by 10 or more 
      aas in the peptide/TCR-binding region, when occurring together with HLA-DPB1 
      incompatibilities, should be considered as high-risk MMs in unrelated HSCT.

TI  - Prevention of Allograft Rejection by Use of Regulatory T Cells With an 
      MHC-Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor.
PG  - 917-930
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14175 [doi]
AB  - CD4(+) CD25(high) FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in 
      graft-specific tolerance after solid organ transplantation. However, adoptive 
      transfer of polyspecific Tregs alone is insufficient to prevent graft rejection 
      even in rodent models, indicating that graft-specific Tregs are required. We 
      developed a highly specific chimeric antigen receptor that recognizes the HLA 
      molecule A*02 (referred to as A2-CAR). Transduction into natural regulatory T 
      cells (nTregs) changes the specificity of the nTregs without alteration of their 
      regulatory phenotype and epigenetic stability. Activation of nTregs via the 
      A2-CAR induced proliferation and enhanced the suppressor function of modified 
      nTregs. Compared with nTregs, A2-CAR Tregs exhibited superior control of strong 
      allospecific immune responses in vitro and in humanized mouse models. A2-CAR 
      Tregs completely prevented rejection of allogeneic target cells and tissues in 
      immune reconstituted humanized mice in the absence of any immunosuppression. 
      Therefore, these modified cells have great potential for incorporation into 
      clinical trials of Treg-supported weaning after allogeneic transplantation.

      Professional Antigen-Presenting Cells.
PG  - 415
LID - 415
AB  - Autologous chondrocyte implantation is the current gold standard cell therapy for 
      cartilage lesions. However, in some instances, the heavily compromised health of 
      the patient can either impair or limit the recovery of the autologous 
      chondrocytes and a satisfactory outcome of the implant. Allogeneic human 
      articular chondrocytes (hAC) could be a good alternative, but the possible 
      immunological incompatibility between recipient and hAC donor should be 
      considered. Herein, we report that allogeneic hAC inhibited T lymphocyte response 
      to antigen-dependent and -independent proliferative stimuli. This effect was 
      maximal when T cells and hAC were in contact and it was not relieved by the 
      addition of exogenous lymphocyte growth factor interleukin (IL)-2. More 
      important, hAC impaired the differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes induced 
      with granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 (Mo) to professional 
      antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC). Indeed, a marked 
      inhibition of the onset of the CD1a expression and an ineffective downregulation 
      of CD14 antigens was observed in Mo-hAC co-cultures. Furthermore, compared to 
      immature or mature DC, Mo from Mo-hAC co-cultures did not trigger an efficacious 
      allo-response. The prostaglandin (PG) E(2) present in the Mo-hAC co-culture 
      conditioned media is a putative candidate of the hAC-mediated inhibition of Mo 
      maturation. Altogether, these findings indicate that allogeneic hAC inhibit, 
      rather than trigger, immune response and strongly suggest that an efficient 
      chondrocyte implantation could be possible also in an allogeneic setting.

TI  - Immunogenicity of human embryonic stem cell-derived beta cells.
PG  - 126-133
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To overcome the donor shortage in the treatment of advanced type 
      1 diabetes by islet transplantation, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) show 
      great potential as an unlimited alternative source of beta cells. hESCs may have 
      immune privileged properties and it is important to determine whether these 
      properties are preserved in hESC-derived cells. METHODS: We comprehensively 
      investigated interactions of both innate and adaptive auto- and allo-immunity 
      with hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells and hESC-derived endocrine cells, 
      retrieved after in-vivo differentiation in capsules in the subcutis of mice. 
      RESULTS: We found that hESC-derived pancreatic endodermal cells expressed 
      relatively low levels of HLA endorsing protection from specific immune responses. 
      HLA was upregulated when exposed to IFNgamma, making these endocrine progenitor cells 
      vulnerable to cytotoxic T cells and alloreactive antibodies. In 
      vivo-differentiated endocrine cells were protected from complement, but expressed 
      more HLA and were targets for alloreactive antibody-dependent cellular 
      cytotoxicity and alloreactive cytotoxic T cells. After HLA compatibility was 
      provided by transduction with HLA-A2, preproinsulin-specific T cells killed 
      insulin-producing cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: hESC-derived pancreatic 
      progenitors are hypoimmunogenic, while in vivo-differentiated endocrine cells 
      represent mature targets for adaptive immune responses. Our data support the need 
      for immune intervention in transplantation of hESC-derived pancreatic 
      progenitors. Cell-impermeable macro-encapsulation may suffice.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: The immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells 
      (MSCs), together with their tissue regenerative potential, make them interesting 
      candidates for clinical application. METHODS: In the current study, we analyzed 
      the in vitro immunomodulatory effects of MSCs derived from bone marrow (BM-MSCs) 
      and from adipose tissue (AT-MSCs) obtained from the same donor on both innate and 
      acquired immunity cells. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs were expanded to fourth or fifth 
      passage and co-cultured with T cells, monocytes or natural killer (NK) cells 
      isolated from human peripheral blood and stimulated in vitro. The possible 
      differing impact of MSCs obtained from distinct sources on phenotype, cell 
      proliferation and differentiation, cytokine production and function of these 
      immune cells was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs induced a 
      similar decrease in NK-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion and expression of 
      both activating receptors and cytotoxic molecules. However, only BM-MSCs 
      significantly reduced NK-cell cytotoxic activity, although both MSC populations 
      showed the same susceptibility to NK-cell-mediated lysis. AT-MSCs were more 
      potent in inhibiting dendritic-cell (DC) differentiation than BM-MSC, but both 
      MSC populations similarly reduced the ability of DCs to induce CD4(+) T-cell 
      proliferation and cytokine production. BM-MSCs and AT-MSCs induced a similar 
      decrease in T-cell proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines after 
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs from the same donor had similar 
      immunomodulatory capacity on both innate and acquired immunity cells. Thus, other 
      variables, such as accessibility of samples or the frequency of MSCs in the 
      tissue should be considered to select the source of MSC for cell therapy.

TI  - Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Human Bone Marrow and Adipose Tissue Maintain 
      Their Immunosuppressive Properties After Chondrogenic Differentiation: Role of 
      HLA-G.
PG  - 1454-69
LID - 10.1089/scd.2016.0022 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged as alternative sources of stem cells 
      for regenerative medicine because of their multipotency and strong 
      immune-regulatory properties. Also, human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is an 
      important mediator of MSC-mediated immunomodulation. However, it is unclear 
      whether MSC retain their immune-privileged potential after differentiation. As 
      promising candidates for cartilage tissue engineering, the immunogenic and 
      immunomodulatory properties of chondro-differentiated MSC (chondro-MSC) require 
      in-depth exploration. In the present study, we used the alginate/hyaluronic acid 
      (Alg/HA) hydrogel scaffold and induced both bone marrow- and adipose 
      tissue-derived MSC into chondrocytes in three-dimensional condition. Then, MSC 
      before and after chondrocyte differentiation were treated or not with interferon 
      gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha mimicking inflammatory conditions and were compared 
      side by side using flow cytometry, mixed lymphocyte reaction, and immunostaining 
      assays. Results showed that chondro-MSC were hypoimmunogenic and could exert 
      immunosuppression on HLA-mismatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as 
      undifferentiated MSC did. This alloproliferation inhibition mediated by MSC or 
      chondro-MSC was dose dependent. Meanwhile, chondro-MSC exerted inhibition on 
      natural killer cell-mediated cytolysis. Also, we showed that HLA-G expression was 
      upregulated in chondro-MSC under hypoxia context and could be boosted in 
      allogenic settings. Besides, the Alg/HA hydrogel scaffold was hypoimmunogenic and 
      its addition for supporting MSC chondrocyte differentiation did not modify the 
      immune properties of MSC. Finally, considering their chondro-regenerative 
      potential and their retained immunosuppressive capacity, MSC constitute promising 
      allogenic sources of stem cells for cartilage repair.

TI  - Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells from Clinical Scale Culture: In Vitro 
      Evaluation of Their Differentiation, Hematopoietic Support, and Immunosuppressive 
      Capacities.
PG  - 1299-310
LID - 10.1089/scd.2016.0071 [doi]
AB  - The differentiation capacity, hematopoietic support, and immunomodulatory 
      properties of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) make them 
      attractive therapeutic agents for a wide range of diseases. Clinical scale 
      cultures (CSCs) have been used to expand BM-MSCs for their use in cell therapy 
      protocols; however, little is known about the functionality of the expanded 
      cells. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the functional 
      characteristics of BM-MSCs expanded from CSCs to determine the quality of the 
      cells for cellular therapy protocols. To address this issue, we analyzed the 
      morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation potential (adipogenic, osteogenic 
      and chondrogenic), hematopoietic support, and immunosuppressive capacity of 
      BM-MSCs from short scale cultures (SSCs) and CSCs in a comparative manner. After 
      12 days of culture in CSCs (HYPERFlask System), BM-MSCs reached cell numbers of 
      125.52 x 10(6) +/- 25.6 x 10(6) MSCs, which corresponded to the number of cells 
      required for transplantation ( approximately 1.7 x 10(6) MSCs/kg for a 70-kg patient). After 
      expansion, BM-MSCs expressed the characteristic markers CD73, CD90, and CD105; 
      however, expansion decreased their differentiation capacity toward the 
      adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages and their ability to inhibit 
      T-cell proliferation compared with SSCs-MSCs. Importantly, CSCs-MSCs maintained 
      the ability to support the proliferation and expansion of hematopoietic 
      progenitor cells and the capacity to express the molecules, cytokines, and 
      extracellular matrix proteins involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Our 
      study highlights the need to evaluate the functional properties of the expanded 
      BM-MSCs for verification of their quality for cell therapy protocols.

TI  - Histone deacetylase 3 regulates the inflammatory gene expression programme of 
      rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
PG  - 277-285
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-209064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Non-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) have 
      demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in both in vitro and in vivo models of 
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we investigated the potential contribution of 
      specific class I and class IIb HDACs to inflammatory gene expression in RA 
      fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). METHODS: RA FLS were incubated with pan-HDACi 
      (ITF2357, givinostat) or selective HDAC1/2i, HDAC3/6i, HDAC6i and HDAC8i. 
      Alternatively, FLS were transfected with HDAC3, HDAC6 or interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta 
      receptor alpha chain (IFNAR1) siRNA. mRNA expression of interleukin 
      (IL)-1beta-inducible genes was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) array and 
      signalling pathway activation by immunoblotting and DNA-binding assays. RESULTS: 
      HDAC3/6i, but not HDAC1/2i and HDAC8i, significantly suppressed the majority of 
      IL-1beta-inducible genes targeted by pan-HDACi in RA FLS. Silencing of HDAC3 
      expression reproduced the effects of HDAC3/6i on gene regulation, contrary to 
      HDAC6-specific inhibition and HDAC6 silencing. Screening of the candidate signal 
      transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 transcription factor revealed 
      that HDAC3/6i abrogated STAT1 Tyr701 phosphorylation and DNA binding, but did not 
      affect STAT1 acetylation. HDAC3 activity was required for type I IFN production 
      and subsequent STAT1 activation in FLS. Suppression of type I IFN release by 
      HDAC3/6i resulted in reduced expression of a subset of IFN-dependent genes, 
      including the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL11. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of HDAC3 in RA 
      FLS largely recapitulates the effects of pan-HDACi in suppressing inflammatory 
      gene expression, including type I IFN production in RA FLS. Our results identify 
      HDAC3 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of RA and type I 
      IFN-driven autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Human amnion favours tissue repair by inducing the M1-to-M2 switch and enhancing 
      M2 macrophage features.

AB  - Human amniotic mesenchymal cells (hAMTCs) possess interesting immunomodulatory 
      properties, making them attractive candidates for regenerative medicine 
      applications. Recent in vivo reports argue in favour of an important role for 
      macrophages as targets of hAMTC-mediated suppression of inflammation and the 
      enhancement of tissue repair. However, a comprehensive study of the effects of 
      hAMTCs and their conditioned medium (CM) on human macrophage differentiation and 
      function is unavailable. In the present study we found that hAMTCs and CM induce 
      the differentiation of myeloid cells (U937 and monocytes) towards macrophages. We 
      then investigated their effects on monocytes differentiated toward 
      pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Monocytes treated under 
      M1 conditions in the presence of hAMTCs or CMs shifted towards M2-like 
      macrophages, which expressed CD14, CD209, CD23, CD163 and PM-2 K, possessed 
      higher phagocytic activity and produced higher IL-10 and lower pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines. They were also poor T cell stimulators and Th1 inducers, while they 
      were able to increase activated and naive suppressive Treg subsets. We show that 
      prostaglandins, and not IL-6, play a role in determining the M2 activation 
      status. Instead, monocytes treated under M2 conditions in the presence of hAMTCs 
      or CM retained M2-like features, but with an enhanced anti-inflammatory profile, 
      having a reduced expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80, reduced 
      phagocytosis activity and decreased the secretion of inflammatory chemokines. 
      Importantly, we provide evidence that macrophages re-educated by CM improve 
      tissue regeneration/repair in wound-healing models. In conclusion, we identified 
      new cell targets of hAMTCs and their bioactive factors and here provide insight 
      into the beneficial effects observed when these cells are used in therapeutic 
      approaches in vivo. (c) 2016 The Authors Journal of Tissue Engineering and

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are undergoing intensive testing in clinical trials 
      as a promising new therapy for many inflammatory diseases and for regenerative 
      medicine, but further optimization of current MSC-based therapies is required. In 
      this study, we found that in addition to direct complement-mediated attack 
      through the assembly of membrane attack complexes (MACs) that we and others have 
      recently reported, of the released complement activation products, C5a, but not 
      C3a, activates neutrophils in the blood to further damage MSCs through oxidative 
      burst. In addition, we have developed a simple method for painting factor H, a 
      native complement inhibitor, onto MSCs to locally inhibit complement activation 
      on MSCs. MSCs painted with factor H are protected from both MAC- and 
      neutrophil-mediated attack and are significantly more effective in inhibiting 
      antigen-specific T cell responses than the mock-painted MSCs both in vitro and 
      in vivo.

TI  - Allogeneic chondrogenically differentiated human mesenchymal stromal cells do not 
      induce immunogenic responses from T lymphocytes in vitro.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: In regenerative medicine, the use of allogeneic cells could 
      enable the development of "off the shelf" therapies for patients with critical 
      size bone defects, reducing limitations observed with the use of autologous 
      cells, such as cost and time to treat the patient. The idea of the use of 
      allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) has been of interest in 
      tissue engineering studies. However, little is known about the properties of 
      these cells upon differentiation. Chondrogenically differentiated BMSCs have 
      already been shown to form endochondral bone in immunodeficient and 
      immunocompetent animals. The success of this bone formation is dependent on the 
      host's endogenous cells. This study investigates the interactions between 
      allogeneic chondrogenically differentiated human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal 
      cell (hBMSC) pellets and T lymphocytes in vitro. METHODS: Non-chondrogenic 
      (-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta3) and chondrogenic hBMSC (+TGFbeta3) pellets 
      were directly co-cultured with unstimulated and CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 7 days. hBMSC pellets from the co-culture 
      were either fixed for histological analysis or quantitative real time polymerase 
      chain reaction (qRT-PCR). PBMCs were harvested for flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flow 
      cytometic analysis revealed that chondrogenically differentiated hBMSC pellets 
      did not alter the number or proliferation of CD4+, CD8+ T cells or FoxP3+ T 
      regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+CD127-). Chondrogenic hBMSC pellets did not induce 
      immunogenic responses in unstimulated PBMCs. Infiltrating CD3 T cells were found 
      in the matrix of hBMSC pellets. Furthermore, qRT-PCR demonstrated low levels of 
      T-cell activation genes (CD25, CD69, PRF1 and GZMB) in addition to low gene 
      expression levels of the pro-inflammatory gene tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) 
      in chondrogenically differentiated hBMSC pellets cultured with unstimulated PBMCs 
      in comparison with non-chondrogenic hBMSC pellets. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively the 
      results of this study demonstrate that allogeneic chondrogenically differentiated 
      hBMSC pellets are non-immunogenic and do not induce the activation of destructive 
      T-cell responses in vitro.

TI  - Hydroxychloroquine protects melanocytes from autoantibody-induced injury by 
      reducing the binding of antigen-antibody complexes.
PG  - 1275-82
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.5354 [doi]
AB  - Vitiligo is a polygenic autoimmune disorder characterized by loss of pigmentation 
      due to melanocyte destruction. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective 
      immunosuppressant widely used in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. As 
      generalized vitiligo (GV) is commonly considered to be a T cell and 
      autoantibody-induced immune disorder, the present study aimed to determine 
      whether HCQ protects melanocytes from autoantibody‑induced disruption. 
      Anti‑melanocyte antibodies were obtained from the serum of patients with 
      progressive GV and the effects of HCQ on prevent the autoantibody‑induced 
      disruption of melanocytes was observed. Cell‑based ELISA, indirect 
      immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to analyze the autoantibody 
      content of sera samples obtained from 32 patients with progressive GV. The 
      cytotoxicity of HCQ was detected by MTT assay, and 1 microg/ml HCQ was applied to 
      human primary melanocytes (HMCs) to examine whether it could exert protective 
      effects against autoantibody‑induced immune injury. Flow cytometry was used to 
      measure autoantibody binding to the surface of HMCs. Complement‑dependent 
      cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody‑dependent cell‑mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) were 
      monitored by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase‑releasing assays. The concentration of 
      autoantibodies in sera samples taken from GV patients was significantly higher 
      than in controls, particularly in patients who had >10% of their body surface 
      affected by vitiligo. The majority of the autoantibodies presented in the HMCs 
      and human keratinocytes (HKCs) and were predominantly localized to the cell 
      surface and cytoplasm. The molecular weights of the autoantigens were identified 
      as 30, 37‑39, 42, 53, 60‑75, 90, 100, 110, and 126 kDa; the 30 kDa protein was 
      observed only in HMCs. The addition of HCQ at a concentration of 1 microg/ml produced 
      no significant cytotoxicity in HMCs and was demonstrated to reduce the binding of 
      GV immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the surface of HMCs. HCQ also significantly 
      decreased the effects of ADCC and CDC that were mediated by GV IgG. The present 
      study provides evidence that HCQ dissociates autoantibody-antigen complexes on 
      the surface of HMCs and reverses ADCC and CDC activity in vitro. Thus, in 
      addition to its effectiveness as an antimalarial therapeutic agent, HCQ may also 
      be a promising potential treatment for patients with vitiligo.

AB  - T cells play a pivotal role in controlling the immune response and have been the 
      focus of extensive research. We studied the process of in vitro generation of 
      antigen-specific T effector cells (Teffs) to assess the dynamics of antigen 
      presentation and determine the best conditions for cell therapy. We used a 
      peptidic construct consisting of combined HLA class I and II epitopes of the 
      tumor antigen MAGE-3 as an antigen. Monocytes were isolated from healthy donors 
      and were differentiated to dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. The peptide was added 
      to the DC culture, the pulsed cells were transferred to a co-culture with 
      lymphocytes from the same donor, either as irradiated feeders or untreated, and 
      were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-2. Several rounds of restimulation 
      followed. The cells were analyzed by Flow Cytometry, and cytokine levels were 
      measured by ELISA and Cytometric Bead Array for Th1/Th2/Th17 profiling. The 
      results showed that the lymphocytes in culture upregulated their activation 
      markers and produced Th1 proinflammatory cytokines in response to the peptide, 
      optimally when it was presented by non-irradiated dendritic cells in the presence 
      of IL-2. In contrast, DC irradiation resulted in low activation potential and a 
      shift toward a suppressive phenotype. After prolonged antigenic stimulation, the 
      culture displayed Th17 polarization. In conclusion, the functional integrity of 
      DCs is necessary for the development of antigen-specific Teffs, and culture 
      conditions can be developed to create Teffs with specific properties for eventual 
      use in cell therapy applications.

AB  - Human liver stem cells (HLSCs) are a mesenchymal stromal cell-like population 
      resident in the adult liver. Preclinical studies indicate that HLSCs could be a 
      good candidate for cell therapy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 
      immunogenicity and the immunomodulatory properties of HLSCs on T-lymphocytes, 
      natural killer cells (NKs), and dendritic cells (DCs) in allogeneic experimental 
      settings. We found that HLSCs inhibited T-cell proliferation by a mechanism 
      independent of cell contact and dependent on the release of prostaglandin E2 
      (PGE2) and on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity. When compared with 
      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), HLSCs were more efficient in inhibiting T-cell 
      proliferation. At variance with MSCs, HLSCs did not elicit NK degranulation. 
      Moreover, HLSCs inhibited NK degranulation against K562, a NK-sensitive target, 
      by a mechanism dependent on HLA-G release. When tested on DC generation from 
      monocytes, HLSCs were found to impair DC differentiation and DCs ability to 
      induce T-cell proliferation through PGE2. This study shows that HLSCs have 
      immunomodulatory properties similar to MSCs, but, at variance with MSCs, they do 
      not elicit a NK response.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) causes an extensive loss of heart muscle cells and 
      leads to congestive heart disease (CAD), the leading cause of mortality and 
      morbidity worldwide. Mesenchymal stromal cell- (MSC-) based cell therapy is a 
      promising option to replace invasive interventions. However the optimal cell type 
      providing significant cardiac regeneration after MI is yet to be found. The aim 
      of our study was to investigate the cardiomyogenic differentiation potential of 
      first trimester human umbilical cord perivascular cells (FTM HUCPVCs), a novel, 
      young source of immunoprivileged mesenchymal stromal cells. Based on the 
      expression of cardiomyocyte markers (cTnT, MYH6, SIRPA, and CX43) FTM and term 
      HUCPVCs achieved significantly increased cardiomyogenic differentiation compared 
      to bone marrow MSCs, while their immunogenicity remained significantly lower as 
      indicated by HLA-A and HLA-G expression and susceptibility to T cell mediated 
      cytotoxicity. When applying aggregate-based differentiation, FTM HUCPVCs showed 
      increased aggregate formation potential and generated contracting cells within 1 
      week of coculture, making them the first MSC type with this ability. Our results 
      indicate that young FTM HUCPVCs have superior cardiomyogenic potential coupled 
      with beneficial immunogenic properties when compared to MSCs of older tissue 
      sources, suggesting that in vitro predifferentiation could be a potential 
      strategy to increase their effectiveness in vivo.

AB  - Alopecia areata (AA) is believed to be a cell-mediated autoimmune hair loss 
      disease. Both CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTLs) are important for the onset 
      and progression of AA. Hair follicle (HF) keratinocyte and/or melanocyte antigen 
      epitopes are suspected potential targets of autoreactive CTLs, but the specific 
      epitopes have not yet been identified. We investigated the potential for a panel 
      of known epitopes, expressed by HF keratinocytes and melanocytes, to induce 
      activation of CTL populations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Specific 
      synthetic epitopes derived from HF antigens trichohyalin and tyrosinase-related 
      protein-2 induced significantly higher frequencies of response in AA CTLs 
      compared with healthy controls (IFN-gamma secretion). Apoptosis assays revealed 
      conditioned media from AA peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with 
      trichohyalin peptides elevated the expression of apoptosis markers in primary HF 
      keratinocytes. A cytokine array revealed higher expression of IL-13 and chemokine 
      ligand 5 (CCL5, RANTES) from AA peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated 
      with trichohyalin peptides compared with controls. The data indicate that AA 
      affected subjects present with an increased frequency of CTLs responsive to 
      epitopes originating from keratinocytes and melanocytes; the activated CTLs 
      secreted soluble factors that induced apoptosis in HF keratinocytes. Potentially, 
      CTL response to self-antigen epitopes, particularly trichohyalin epitopes, could 
      be a prognostic marker for human AA.

AB  - Cell therapy with antigen-specific regulatory T-cells (Treg) has great potential 
      to selectively control unwanted immune responses after allogeneic stem-cell or 
      solid organ transplantation and in autoimmune diseases. Ex vivo allostimulation 
      with costimulatory blockade (alloanergization) of human T-cells expands 
      populations of alloantigen-specific Treg, providing a cellular strategy to 
      control donor T-cell alloresponses causing graft-versus-host disease after 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Crucially, it is not known if 
      Treg expanded in this way are stable in proinflammatory conditions encountered 
      after transplantation, or if they possess capacity to migrate to key target 
      organs. Using an in vitro model to functionally characterize human Treg expanded 
      after alloanergization, we now show that these cells remain potently 
      allosuppressive in the presence of relevant exogenous inflammatory signals. 
      Expanded allospecific Treg retained expression of molecules conferring migratory 
      capacity to several organs but small intestine-specific chemotaxis was markedly 
      impaired, in keeping with the preponderance of gut graft-versus-host disease in 
      previous clinical studies using this strategy. Importantly, impaired gut-specific 
      chemotaxis could be partially corrected by pharmacological treatment. These 
      findings will facilitate more effective application of this cellular approach to 
      limit T-cell alloresponses after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and the 
      wider application of the strategy to other clinical settings.

TI  - Human periodontal ligament stem cells suppress T-cell proliferation via 
      down-regulation of non-classical major histocompatibility complex-like 
      glycoprotein CD1b on dendritic cells.
PG  - 135-146

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) from the 
      periodontal ligament tissue were recently identified as mesenchymal stem cells 
      (MSCs). The capabilities of PDLSCs in periodontal tissue or bone regeneration 
      have been reported, but their immunomodulatory role in T-cell immune responses 
      via dendritic cells (DCs), known as the most potent antigen-presenting cell, has 
      not been studied. The aim of this study is to understand the immunological 
      function of homogeneous human STRO-1(+) CD146(+) PDLSCs in DC-mediated T-cell 
      immune responses to modulate the periodontal disease process. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: We utilized highly purified (> 95%) human STRO-1(+) CD146(+) PDLSCs and 
      human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Each stem cell was co-cultured 
      with human monocyte-derived DCs in the presence of lipopolysaccharide isolated 
      from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogenic bacterium responsible for 
      periodontal disease, in vitro to examine the immunological effect of each stem 
      cell on DCs and DC-mediated T-cell proliferation. RESULTS: We discovered that 
      STRO-1(+) CD146(+) PDLSCs, as well as BMSCs, significantly decreased the level of 
      non-classical major histocompatibility complex glycoprotein CD1b on DCs, 
      resulting in defective T-cell proliferation, whereas most human leukocyte 
      antigens and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in/on DCs were not 
      significantly affected by the presence of BMSCs or STRO-1(+) CD146(+) PDLSCs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study unveiled an immunomodulatory role of STRO-1(+) CD146(+) 
      PDLSCs in negatively regulating DC-mediated T-cell immune responses, 
      demonstrating their potential to be utilized in promising new stem cell 
      therapies.

AB  - Transplantation of ex vivo expanded corneal limbal stem cells (LSCs) has been the 
      main treatment for limbal stem cell deficiency, although the shortage of donor 
      corneal tissues remains a major concern for its wide application. Due to the 
      development of tissue engineering, embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-derived corneal 
      epithelial-like cells (ESC-CECs) become a new direction for this issue. However, 
      the immunogenicity of ESC-CECs is a critical matter to be solved. In the present 
      study, we explored the immunological properties of ESC-CECs, which were 
      differentiated from ESCs. The results showed that ESC-CECs had a similar 
      character and function with LSCs both in vitro and in vivo. In ESC-CECs, a large 
      number of genes related with immune response were down-regulated. The expressions 
      of MHC-I, MHC-II, and co-stimulatory molecules were low, but the expression of 
      HLA-G was high. The ESC-CECs were less responsible for T cell proliferation and 
      NK cell lysis in vitro, and there was less immune cell infiltration after 
      transplantation in vivo compared with LSCs. Moreover, the immunological 
      properties were not affected by interferon-gamma. All these results indicated a low 
      immunogenicity of ESC-CECs, and they can be promising in clinical use.

AB  - The expression of immunogenic markers after differentiation of umbilical cord 
      blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) has been poorly investigated and 
      requires extensive in vitro and in vivo testing for clinical application. The 
      expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) classes on UCB-derived MSC was tested 
      by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and immunocytochemical staining. 
      The undifferentiated MSC were moderately positive for HLA-ABC, but almost 
      completely negative for HLA-DR. The MSC differentiated to chondrocytes expressed 
      neither HLA-ABC nor HLA-DR. The proliferation of MSC was not significantly 
      affected by the allogeneic lymphocytes stimulated with concanavalin A. The 
      responder lymphocytes showed no significant decrease in proliferation in the 
      presence of the MSC, but the apoptosis rate of the lymphocytes was increased in 
      the presence of MSC. Taken together, these findings indicate that UCB-derived MSC 
      differentiated to chondrocytes expressed less HLA class I and no class II 
      antigens. The MSC showed an immunomodulatory effect on the proliferation and 
      apoptosis of allogeneic lymphocytes. These data suggest that the differentiated 
      and undifferentiated allogeneic MSC derived from umbilical cord blood can be a 
      useful candidate for allogeneic cell therapy and transplantation without a major 
      risk of rejection.

TI  - Dynamical System Modeling to Simulate Donor T Cell Response to Whole Exome 
      Sequencing-Derived Recipient Peptides Demonstrates Different Alloreactivity 
      Potential in HLA-Matched and -Mismatched Donor-Recipient Pairs.

AB  - Immune reconstitution kinetics and subsequent clinical outcomes in HLA-matched 
      recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) are variable and 
      difficult to predict. Considering SCT as a dynamical system may allow sequence 
      differences across the exomes of the transplant donors and recipients to be used 
      to simulate an alloreactive T cell response, which may allow better clinical 
      outcome prediction. To accomplish this, whole exome sequencing was performed on 
      34 HLA-matched SCT donor-recipient pairs (DRPs) and the nucleotide sequence 
      differences translated to peptides. The binding affinity of the peptides to the 
      relevant HLA in each DRP was determined. The resulting array of peptide-HLA 
      binding affinity values in each patient was considered as an operator modifying a 
      hypothetical T cell repertoire vector, in which each T cell clone proliferates in 
      accordance with the logistic equation of growth. Using an iterating system of 
      matrices, each simulated T cell clone's growth was calculated with the 
      steady-state population being proportional to the magnitude of the binding 
      affinity of the driving HLA-peptide complex. Incorporating competition between T 
      cell clones responding to different HLA-peptide complexes reproduces a number of 
      features of clinically observed T cell clonal repertoire in the simulated 
      repertoire, including sigmoidal growth kinetics of individual T cell clones and 
      overall repertoire, Power Law clonal frequency distribution, increase in 
      repertoire complexity over time with increasing clonal diversity, and alteration 
      of clonal dominance when a different antigen array is encountered, such as in 
      SCT. The simulated, alloreactive T cell repertoire was markedly different in 
      HLA-matched DRPs. The patterns were differentiated by rate of growth and 
      steady-state magnitude of the simulated T cell repertoire and demonstrate a 
      possible correlation with survival. In conclusion, exome wide sequence 
      differences in DRPs may allow simulation of donor alloreactive T cell response to 
      recipient antigens and may provide a quantitative basis for refining donor 
      selection and titration of immunosuppression after SCT.

AB  - Capturing the full potential of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived neurons 
      in disease modeling and regenerative medicine requires analysis in complex 
      functional systems. Here we establish optogenetic control in human PSC-derived 
      spinal motorneurons and show that co-culture of these cells with human 
      myoblast-derived skeletal muscle builds a functional all-human neuromuscular 
      junction that can be triggered to twitch upon light stimulation. To model 
      neuromuscular disease we incubated these co-cultures with IgG from myasthenia 
      gravis patients and active complement. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune 
      disorder that selectively targets neuromuscular junctions. We saw a reversible 
      reduction in the amplitude of muscle contractions, representing a surrogate 
      marker for the characteristic loss of muscle strength seen in this disease. The 
      ability to recapitulate key aspects of disease pathology and its symptomatic 
      treatment suggests that this neuromuscular junction assay has significant 
      potential for modeling of neuromuscular disease and regeneration.

      therapy.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Genetically engineered human beta cell lines provide a novel 
      source of human beta cells to study metabolism, pharmacology and beta cell 
      replacement therapy. Since the immune system is essentially involved in beta cell 
      destruction in type 1 diabetes and after beta cell transplantation, we 
      investigated the interaction of human beta cell lineswith the immune system to 
      resolve their potential for immune intervention protocol studies. METHODS: Human 
      pancreatic beta cell lines (EndoC-betaH1 and ECi50) generated by targeted 
      oncogenesis in fetal pancreas were assessed for viability after innate and 
      adaptive immune challenges. Beta cell lines were pre-conditioned with T helper 
      type 1 (Th1) cytokines or high glucose to mimic inflammatory and 
      hyperglycaemia-stressed conditions. Beta cells were then co-cultured with auto- 
      and alloreactive cytotoxic T cells (CTL), natural killer (NK) cells, supernatant 
      fraction from activated autoreactive Th1 cells, or alloantibodies in the presence 
      of complement or effector cells. RESULTS: Low HLA expression protected human beta 
      cell lines from adaptive immune destruction, but it was associated with direct 
      killing by activated NK cells. Autoreactive Th1 cell inflammation, rather than 
      glucose stress, induced increased beta cell apoptosis and upregulation of HLA, 
      increasing beta cell vulnerability to killing by auto- and alloreactive CTL and 
      alloreactive antibodies. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that 
      genetically engineered human beta cell lines can be used in vitro to assess 
      diverse immune responses that may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 
      diabetes in humans and beta cell transplantation, enabling preclinical evaluation 
      of novel immune intervention strategies protecting beta cells from immune 
      destruction.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: With the increasing use of cell therapies involving immune 
      modulatory cells, there is a need for a simple standardized method to evaluate 
      and compare the suppressive potency of different cell products. We used the 
      Karpas 299 (K299) cell line as the reference suppressor cell to develop a 
      standardized suppression assay to quantify the immune-modulatory capacity of bone 
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). METHODS: Healthy donor CD4 T 
      cells were co-cultured with the K299 cell line or with third-party BM-MSCs. After 
      stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, CD154 activation and proliferation of CD4 T 
      cells were measured to calculate suppression. RESULTS: The K299 cell line 
      reproducibly suppressed both the activation and proliferation of healthy donor 
      CD4 T cells in a dose-dependent manner. A rapid (16-h) assay that was based on 
      activation-suppression was selected for development. In replicate testing, there 
      was an inherent variability of suppression of 11% coefficient of variation 
      between different responder T cells. Suppression by BM-MSCs on different 
      responders correlated with suppression by K299. We therefore used K299 
      suppression as the reference to define suppression potency of BM-MSCs in K299 
      Suppression Units. We found that inter-donor variability, passage number, method 
      of manufacture and exposure of BM-MSCs to steroids or interferon-gamma all affected 
      BM-MSC potency of suppression. CONCLUSIONS: This method provides a platform for 
      standardizing suppressor function to facilitate comparisons between laboratories 
      and for use as a cell product release assay.

TI  - Targeted Disruption of the beta2-Microglobulin Gene Minimizes the Immunogenicity of 
      Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
PG  - 1234-45
LID - 10.5966/sctm.2015-0049 [doi]
AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising source of cells for tissue 
      regeneration, yet histoincompatibility remains a major challenge to their 
      clinical application. Because the human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) 
      molecules are the primary mediators of immune rejection, we hypothesized that 
      cells derived from a hESC line lacking HLA-I expression could be transplanted 
      without evoking a robust immune response from allogeneic recipients. In the 
      present study, we used the replacement targeting strategy to delete exons 2 and 3 
      of beta2-microglobulin on both gene alleles in hESCs. Because beta2-microglobulin 
      serves as the HLA-I light chain, disruption of the beta2-microglobulin gene led to 
      complete HLA-I deficiency on the cell surface of hESCs and their derivatives. 
      Therefore, these cells were resistant to CD8+ T-cell-mediated destruction. 
      Although interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment significantly induced beta2-microglobulin 
      expression, promoting CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of control hESCs and their 
      derivatives, CD8+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity was barely observed with 
      beta2-microglobulin-null hESCs and their derivatives treated with IFN-gamma. This 
      genetic manipulation to disrupt HLA-I expression did not affect the self-renewal 
      capacity, genomic stability, or pluripotency of hESCs. Despite being relatively 
      sensitive to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing due to the lack of HLA-I 
      expression, when transplanted into NK cell-depleted immunocompetent mice, 
      beta2-microglobulin-null hESCs developed into tumors resembling those derived from 
      control hESCs in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. These results demonstrate 
      that beta2-microglobulin-null hESCs significantly reduce immunogenicity to CD8+ T 
      cells and might provide a renewable source of cells for tissue regeneration 
      without the need for HLA matching in the future. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports 
      the generation of a novel beta2-microglobulin (B2M)-/- human embryonic stem cell 
      (hESC) line. Differentiated mature cells from this line do not express cell 
      surface human leukocyte antigen molecules even after interferon-gamma stimulation and 
      are resistant to alloreactive CD8+ T cells. Moreover, this B2M-/- hESC line 
      contains no off-target integration or cleavage events, is devoid of stable B2M 
      mRNA, exhibits a normal karyotype, and retains its self-renewal capacity, genomic 
      stability, and pluripotency. Although B2M-/- hESC-derived cells are more 
      susceptible to natural killer (NK) cells, murine transplantation studies have 
      indicated that they are, overall, much less immunogenic than normal hESCs. Thus, 
      these data show for the first time that, in vivo, the advantages provided by 
      B2M-/- hESC-derived cells in avoiding CD8+ T-cell killing appear significantly 
      greater than any disadvantage caused by increased susceptibility to NK cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are distinguished 
      by their ability to differentiate into a number of stromal derivatives of 
      interest for regenerative medicine, but they also have immunoregulatory 
      properties that are being tested in a number of clinical settings. METHODS: We 
      show that brief incubations with rapamycin, everolimus, FK506 or cyclosporine A 
      increase the immunosuppressive potency of MSCs and other cell types. RESULTS: The 
      treated MSCs are up to 5-fold more potent at inhibiting the induced proliferation 
      of T lymphocytes in vitro. We show that this effect probably is due to adsorption 
      of the drug by the MSCs during pre-treatment, with subsequent diffusion into 
      co-cultures at concentrations sufficient to inhibit T-cell proliferation. MSCs 
      contain measurable amounts of rapamycin after a 15-min exposure, and the 
      potentiating effect is blocked by a neutralizing antibody to the drug. With the 
      use of a pre-clinical model of acute graft-versus-host disease, we demonstrate 
      that a low dose of rapamycin-treated but not untreated umbilical cord-derived 
      MSCs significantly inhibit the onset of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The use of treated 
      MSCs may achieve clinical end points not reached with untreated MSCs and allow 
      for infusion of fewer cells to reduce costs and minimize potential side effects.

AB  - In vitro differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) into osteocytes 
      (human differentiated osteogenic cells, hDOC) before implantation has been 
      proposed to optimize bone regeneration. However, a deep characterization of the 
      immunological properties of DOC, including their effect on dendritic cell (DC) 
      function, is not available. DOC can be used either as cellular suspension 
      (detached, Det-DOC) or as adherent cells implanted on scaffolds (adherent, 
      Adh-DOC). By mimicking in vitro these two different routes of administration, we 
      show that both Det-DOC and Adh-DOC can modulate DC functions. Specifically, the 
      weak downregulation of CD80 and CD86 caused by Det-DOC on DC surface results in a 
      weak modulation of DC functions, which indeed retain a high capacity to induce 
      T-cell proliferation and to generate CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells. Moreover, 
      Det-DOC enhance the DC capacity to differentiate CD4(+)CD161(+)CD196(+) 
      Th17-cells by upregulating IL-6 secretion. Conversely, Adh-DOC strongly suppress 
      DC functions by a profound downregulation of CD80 and CD86 on DC as well as by 
      the inhibition of TGF-beta production. In conclusion, we demonstrate that different 
      types of DOC cell preparation may have a different impact on the modulation of 
      the host immune system. This finding may have relevant implications for the 
      design of cell-based tissue-engineering strategies.

TI  - HLA Class I Depleted hESC as a Source of Hypoimmunogenic Cells for Tissue 
      Engineering Applications.
PG  - 2559-71
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEA.2015.0105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapidly improving protocols for the derivation of autologous cells 
      from stem cell sources is a welcome development. However, there are many 
      circumstances when off-the-shelf universally immunocompatible cells may be 
      needed. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide a unique opportunity to modify the 
      original source of differentiated cells to minimize their rejection by 
      nonautologous hosts. HYPOTHESIS: Immune rejection of nonautologous human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) derivatives can be reduced by downregulating human 
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, without affecting the ability of these 
      cells to differentiate into specific lineages. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) expression was decreased by lentiviral transduction 
      using human anti-HLA class I light-chain B2M short hairpin RNA. mRNA levels of 
      B2M were decreased by 90% in a RUES2-modified hESC line, as determined by 
      quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The transduced cells 
      were selected under puromycin pressure and maintained in an undifferentiated 
      state. The latter was confirmed by Oct4 and Nanog expression, and by the 
      formation of characteristic round-shaped colonies. B2M downregulation led to 
      diminished HLA-I expression on the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry. 
      When used as target cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, transduced hESCs 
      and their differentiated derivatives did not stimulate allogeneic T-cell 
      proliferation. Using a cardiac differentiation protocol, transduced hESCs formed 
      a confluent layer of cardiac myocytes and maintained a low level of B2M 
      expression. Transduced hESCs were also successfully differentiated into a hepatic 
      lineage, validating their capacity to differentiate into multiple lineages. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HLA-I depletion does not preclude hESC differentiation into cardiac 
      or hepatic lineages. This methodology can be used to engineer tissue from 
      nonautologous hESC sources with improved immunocompatibility.

TI  - Dendritic Cells Differentiated from Human Umbilical Cord Blood-Derived Monocytes 
      Exhibit Tolerogenic Characteristics.
PG  - 2796-807

AB  - Human umbilical cord blood (UCB) is rich in diverse hematopoietic stem cells that 
      are competent to differentiate into various cell types with immunological 
      compatibility at transplantation. Thus, UCB is a potential source for the 
      preparation of dendritic cells (DCs) to be used for cell therapy against 
      inflammatory disorders or cancers. However, the immunological properties of 
      UCB-derived DCs are not fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the 
      phenotypes and functions of UCB monocyte-derived DCs (UCB-DCs) in comparison with 
      those of adult peripheral blood (APB) monocyte-derived DCs (APB-DCs). UCB-DCs 
      contained less CD1a(+) DCs, which is known as immunostimulatory DCs, than 
      APB-DCs. UCB-DCs exhibited lower expression of CD80, MHC proteins, and DC-SIGN, 
      but higher endocytic activity, than APB-DCs. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of 
      UCB-DCs minimally augmented the expression of maturation markers and production 
      of interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, but potently expressed 
      IL-10. When UCB-DCs were cocultured with CD14(+) cell-depleted allogeneic 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, they weakly induced the proliferation, 
      surface expression of activation markers, and interferon (IFN)-gamma production of T 
      lymphocytes compared with APB-DCs. UCB possessed higher levels of prostaglandin 
      E2 (PGE2) than APB, which might be responsible for tolerogenic phenotypes and 
      functions of UCB-DCs. Indeed, APB-DCs prepared in the presence of PGE2 exhibited 
      CD1a(-)CD14(+) phenotypes with tolerogenic properties, including weak maturation, 
      impaired IL-12 production, and negligible T lymphocyte activation as UCB-DCs did. 
      Taken together, we suggest that UCB-DCs have tolerogenic properties, which might 
      be due to PGE2 highly sustained in UCB.

TI  - In Vitro Evaluation of a Novel mRNA-Based Therapeutic Strategy for the Treatment 
      of Patients Suffering from Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency.

AB  - In single-gene disorders, like alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), a gene 
      mutation causes missing or dysfunctional protein synthesis. This, in turn, can 
      lead to serious complications for the patient affected. Furthermore, single-gene 
      disorders are associated with severe early-onset conditions and necessitate 
      expensive lifelong care. Until nowadays, therapeutic treatment options are still 
      limited, cost-intensive, or lack effectiveness. For these reasons, we aim to 
      develop a novel mRNA-based therapeutic strategy for the treatment of single-gene 
      disorders, such as AATD, which is based on the induction of de novo synthesis of 
      the functional proteins. Therefore, an alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) encoding mRNA 
      was generated by in vitro transcription. After in vitro delivery of the mRNA to 
      different cells, protein expression and functionality, as well as adverse effects 
      and mRNA serum stability, were analyzed. Our results show that the AAT 
      mRNA-transfected cells express the AAT protein in high amounts within the first 
      24 h. Moreover, the expressed AAT protein is highly functional, since the 
      activity of elastase is significantly inhibited. Our data also show that mRNA 
      concentrations up to 1 mug per 150,000 cells have no adverse effects on cell 
      viability and immune activation. Furthermore, the encapsulated AAT encoding mRNA 
      is stable and functional in human serum for up to 30 min. Overall, the proposed 
      project provides an innovative, highly promising, and safe therapeutic approach 
      and, thus, promises a novel progress in the treatment of single-gene disorders, 
      whereby affected patients could greatly benefit.

TI  - BMP protein-mediated crosstalk between inflammatory cells and human pluripotent 
      stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Following cardiac injury, the ischaemic heart tissue is characterized by the 
      invasion of pro-inflammatory (M1) and pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Any 
      engineered cardiac tissue will inevitably interact with the inflammatory 
      environment found at the site of myocardial infarction at the time of 
      implantation. However, the interactions between the inflammatory and the cardiac 
      repair cells remain poorly understood. Here we recapitulated in vitro some of the 
      important cellular events found at the site of myocardial injury, such as 
      macrophage recruitment and their effect on cardiac differentiation and 
      maturation, by taking into account the involvement of paracrine-mediated 
      signalling. By using a 3D inverted invasion assay, we found that cardiomyocyte 
      (CM) conditioned medium can trigger the recruitment of pro-inflammatory (M1) 
      macrophages, through a mechanism that involves, in part, CM-derived BMP4. 
      Pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages were also found to affect CM proliferation and 
      differentiation potential, in part due to BMP molecules secreted by macrophages. 
      These effects involved the activation of the canonical outside-in signalling 
      pathways, such as SMAD1,5,8, which are known to be activated during myocardial 
      injury in vivo. In the present study we propose a new role for CM- and 
      macrophage-derived BMP proteins during the recruitment of macrophage subtypes and 
      the maturation of repair cells, representing an important step towards creating a 
      functional cardiac patch with superior therapeutic properties. Copyright (c) 2015

AB  - Previous animal studies showed that donor-derived blood cells treated with 
      mitomycin C (MMC) prolong allograft survival when injected into recipients. This 
      model was effective with whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
      (monocytes being the active cell subpopulation) or dendritic cells. In view of a 
      potential clinical application, we study now the immunosuppressive properties of 
      human myeloid cells in vitro. Mature dendritic cells (generated from naive 
      monocytes) or monocytes treated with mitomycin C do not or only weakly inhibit 
      allogeneic T cells in vitro, whereas cells in an early differentiation state 
      between monocytes and DC exert suppressive activity when treated with MMC. In 
      contrast, DC generated from MMC-treated monocytes show the morphology and 
      phenotype of early immature DC (iDC) and suppress T-cell responses. It is known 
      that untreated monocytes injected into a recipient encounter a cytokine milieu 
      which differentiates them to stimulatory DC. In our in vitro experiment 
      MMC-treated monocytes cultured in a DC-maturing milieu transform themselves into 
      suppressive early iDC. This reproduces a process which takes place when 
      administering MMC-monocytes to a recipient. In conclusion, human MMC-DC or 
      MMC-monocytes are not or only weakly suppressive in vitro. When MMC-monocytes are 
      differentiated to DC the resulting cells become suppressive.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Clinical trials have documented beneficial effects of 
      mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow and adipose tissue (ASCs) as treatment 
      in patients with ischemic heart disease. However, retention of transplanted cells 
      is poor. One potential way to increase cell retention is to inject the cells in 
      an in situ cross-linked alginate hydrogel. METHODS: ASCs from abdominal human 
      tissue were embedded in alginate hydrogel and alginate hydrogel modified with 
      Arg-Gly-Asp motifs (RGD-alginate) and cultured for 1 week. Cell viability, 
      phenotype, immunogenicity and paracrine activity were determined by confocal 
      microscopy, dendritic cell co-culture, flow cytometry, reverse transcriptase 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Luminex multiplex, and lymphocyte 
      proliferation experiments. RESULTS: ASCs performed equally well in alginate and 
      RGD-alginate. After 1 week of alginate culture, cell viability was >93%. 
      Mesenchymal markers CD90 and CD29 were reduced compared with International 
      Society for Cellular Therapy criteria. Cells sedimented from the alginates during 
      cultivation regained the typical level of these markers, and trilineage 
      differentiation was performed by standard protocols. Hepatocyte growth factor 
      mRNA was increased in ASCs cultivated in alginates compared with monolayer 
      controls. Alginates and alginates containing ASCs did not induce dendritic cell 
      maturation. ASCs in alginate responded like controls to interferon-gamma 
      stimulation (licensing), and alginate culture increased the ability of ASCs to 
      inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. DISCUSSION: ASCs remain viable in alginates; 
      they transiently change phenotype in alginate hydrogel but regain the phenotype 
      of monolayer controls upon release. Cells maintain their paracrine potential 
      while in alginates; the combination of ASCs and alginate is non-immunogenic and, 
      in fact, immunosuppressive.

AB  - Over the past decade there has been a growing interest in using mesenchymal stem 
      cells (MSCs) as an immune-regulatory agent for prevention and treatment of 
      various immune disorders including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplanted 
      organ rejection, and autoimmune diseases. However, the high diversity in the 
      results from clinical trials using MSCs for such disorders emphasizes the need 
      for MSCs to be "professionalized" ex vivo to a more defined regulatory phenotype 
      before administering to patients. To this aim, we have established an ex vivo 
      immunomodulatory triple combination treatment (TCT) for MSCs, using IFNgamma, TGFbeta, 
      and kynurenine. We show that pretreated MSCs acquire an immunomodulatory 
      phenotype, have improved regulatory functions, and upregulate the expression of 
      inducible nitric oxide synthase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2 
      (COX2), heme oxygenase 1, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and programmed death 
      ligand 1. We define the pathway of kynurenine induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
      activation in MSCs and how it contributes to the upregulation of COX2 expression 
      and IL-6 downregulation. The combination of reduced IL-6 secretion with enhanced 
      LIF expression leads to the inhibition of Th17 differentiation in coculture of 
      TCT MSCs and lymphocytes. To test the immunomodulatory function of TCT MSCs in 
      vivo, we used the cells as GVHD prophylaxis in a GVHD mouse model. TCT MSCs 
      administration significantly decreased GVHD score and improved mouse survival. 
      Importantly, single administration could attenuate disease symptoms for more than 
      3 weeks. Based on these results, we suggest considering TCT MSCs as an improved 
      cell therapy for systemic diseases with an underlying inflammatory and 
      immunologic etiology. Stem Cells 2015;33:2256-2267.

TI  - Codon optimization of the human papillomavirus E7 oncogene induces a CD8+ T cell

AB  - Codon optimization of nucleotide sequences is a widely used method to achieve 
      high levels of transgene expression for basic and clinical research. Until now, 
      immunological side effects have not been described. To trigger T cell responses 
      against human papillomavirus, we incubated T cells with dendritic cells that were 
      pulsed with RNA encoding the codon-optimized E7 oncogene. All T cell receptors 
      isolated from responding T cell clones recognized target cells expressing the 
      codon-optimized E7 gene but not the wild type E7 sequence. Epitope mapping 
      revealed recognition of a cryptic epitope from the +3 alternative reading frame 
      of codon-optimized E7, which is not encoded by the wild type E7 sequence. The 
      introduction of a stop codon into the +3 alternative reading frame protected the 
      transgene product from recognition by T cell receptor gene-modified T cells. This 
      is the first experimental study demonstrating that codon optimization can render 
      a transgene artificially immunogenic through generation of a dominant cryptic 
      epitope. This finding may be of great importance for the clinical field of gene 
      therapy to avoid rejection of gene-corrected cells and for the design of DNA- and 
      RNA-based vaccines, where codon optimization may artificially add a strong 
      immunogenic component to the vaccine.

AB  - After organ transplantation, recipient T cells contribute to graft rejection. 
      Mesenchymal stromal cells from the bone marrow (BM-MSCs) are known to suppress 
      allogeneic T-cell responses, suggesting a possible clinical application of MSCs 
      in organ transplantation. Human liver grafts harbor resident populations of MSCs 
      (L-MSCs). We aimed to determine the immunosuppressive effects of these 
      graft-derived MSCs on allogeneic T-cell responses and to compare these with the 
      effects of BM-MSCs. BM-MSCs were harvested from aspirates and L-MSCs from liver 
      graft perfusates. We cultured them for 21 days and compared their suppressive 
      effects with the effects of BM-MSCs on allogeneic T-cell responses. 
      Proliferation, cytotoxic degranulation, and interferon-gamma production of 
      alloreactive T cells were more potently suppressed by L-MSCs than BM-MSCs. 
      Suppression was mediated by both cell-cell contact and secreted factors. In 
      addition, L-MSCs showed ex vivo a higher expression of PD-L1 than BM-MSCs, which 
      was associated with inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic 
      degranulation in vitro. Blocking PD-L1 partly abrogated the inhibition of 
      cytotoxic degranulation by L-MSCs. In addition, blocking indoleamine 
      2,3-dioxygenase partly abrogated the inhibitive effects of L-MSCs, but not 
      BM-MSCs, on T-cell proliferation. In conclusion, liver graft-derived MSC 
      suppression of allogeneic T-cell responses is stronger than BM-MSCs, which may be 
      related to in situ priming and mobilization from the graft. These graft-derived 
      MSCs may therefore be relevant in transplantation by promoting 
      allohyporesponsiveness.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is highly prevalent and needs novel therapies. 
      Melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3) is a lung cancer antigen and calreticulin 
      (CALR) can modulate immune responses. Our previous study has shown that 
      up-regulated MAGE-A3 and CALR expression inhibits the proliferation and invasion 
      of glioma cells. In this study, we examined the effect of adenovirus 
      (Ad)-mediated MAGE-A3 and/or CALR expression on the proliferation, invasion, and 
      apoptosis of human NSCLC cells and on the vascular tube formation of human 
      endothelial cells as well as on dendritic cell (DC) activation and induced CD8(+) 
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in vitro. We found that low levels of CALR 
      and MAGE-A3 were expressed by A549 cells, but only very low CALR was expressed by 
      DC. Up-regulated CALR and MAGE-A3 expression by infection with Ad-CALR/MAGE-A3 
      significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion, but promoted the 
      apoptosis of A549 cells. Up-regulated CALR and MAGE-A3 expression significantly 
      inhibited cyclin D1 expression and the AKT, ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB expression and 
      phosphorylation in A549 cells. Up-regulated CALR expression inhibited the tube 
      formation in human endothelial cells. Up-regulated CALR and MAGE-A3 expression 
      synergistically enhanced classical DC activation by enhancing IL-12, but reducing 
      IL-10 secretion. Furthermore, CTLs induced by up-regulated CALR and MAGE-A3 
      expressing DCs synergistically triggered A549 cell apoptosis, which was abrogated 
      by treatment with anti-HLA I, but not anti-HLA II antibodies. Moreover, CTLs 
      induced by CALR and MAGE-A3-expressing DCs had a higher frequency of 
      A549-specific IFN-gamma-secreting T cells. Our data indicated that up-regulated CALR 
      and MAGE-A3 expression inhibited the carcinogenesis of NSCLC by modulating the 
      AKT, ERK MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling and enhanced classical DC activation and 
      MAGE-A3-specific CTL cytotoxicity. Therefore, our findings may provide new 
      insights in understanding the role of CALR in modulating antigen-specific T cell 
      immunity and may aid in the design of new therapies for NSCLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered the best candidate in 
      stem cells therapy due to their multipotent differentiation ability, low 
      expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD34 and HLA-II) and 
      immunosuppression effects on in vivo immune responses. MSCs were now widely used 
      in clinical trials but received no encourage results. The major problem was the 
      fate of engrafted MSCs in vivo could not be defined. Some studies indicated that 
      MSCs could induce immune response and result in the damage and rejection of MSCs. 
      As toll like receptors (TLRs) are important in inducing of immune responses, in 
      this study we study the role of TLR7 in mediating the immune status of MSCs 
      isolated from umbilical cord. RESULTS: Our results indicated that TLR7 agonist 
      Imiquimod could increase the proliferation of PBMC isolated from healthy human 
      volunteers and release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in supernatant from 
      PBMC-UCMSCs co-culture system. Flow cytometry and quantitative PCR also confirmed 
      the regulated expression of surface co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory 
      genes (IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TGF-beta and TNF-alpha). And the down-regulation expression of 
      stem cell markers also confirmed the loss of stemness of UCMSCs. We also found 
      that the osteo-differentiation ability of UCMSCs was enhanced in the presence of 
      Imiquimod. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report that activation 
      of TLR7 pathway increases the immunogenicity of UCMSCs. Extensive researches have 
      now been conducted to study whether the change of immune status will be help in 
      tumor rejection based on the tumor-tropism of MSCs.

TI  - Evaluation of the immunomodulatory effect of melatonin on the T-cell response in 
      peripheral blood from systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
PG  - 219-26

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the 
      production of antinuclear autoantibodies. In addition, the involvement of CD4+ 
      T-helper (Th) cells in SLE has become increasingly evident. Although the role of 
      melatonin has been tested in some experimental models of lupus with inconclusive 
      results, there are no studies evaluating the melatonin effect on cells from 
      patients with SLE. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the role of in 
      vitro administered melatonin in the immune response of peripheral leukocytes from 
      treated patients with SLE (n = 20) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. 
      Melatonin was tested for its effect on the production of key Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17 
      and innate cytokines. The frequency of T regulatory (Treg) cells and the 
      expression of FOXP3 and BAFF were also explored. Our results are the first to 
      show that melatonin decreased the production of IL-5 and to describe the novel 
      role of melatonin in IL-9 production by human circulating cells. Additionally, we 
      highlighted a two-faceted melatonin effect. Although it acted as a prototypical 
      anti-inflammatory compound, reducing exacerbated Th1 and innate responses in 
      PHA-stimulated cells from healthy subjects, it caused the opposite actions in 
      immune-depressed cells from patients with SLE. Melatonin also increased the 
      number of Treg cells expressing FOXP3 and offset BAFF overexpression in SLE 
      patient cells. These findings open a new field of research in lupus that could 
      lead to the use of melatonin as treatment or cotreatment for SLE.

TI  - Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Utilize Activin-A to Suppress 
      Interferon-gamma Production by Natural Killer Cells.
PG  - 662

AB  - Following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), interferon 
      (IFN)-gamma levels in the recipient's body can strongly influence the clinical 
      outcome. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are 
      lucrative as biological tolerance-inducers in HSCT settings. Hence, we studied 
      the molecular mechanism of how UC-MSCs influence natural killer (NK) 
      cell-mediated IFN-gamma production. Allogeneic NK cells were cultured in direct 
      contact with UC-MSCs or cell-free supernatants from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
      cultures (MSC-conditioned media). We found that soluble factors secreted by 
      UC-MSCs strongly suppressed interleukin (IL)-12/IL-18-induced IFN-gamma production by 
      NK cells by reducing phosphorylation of STAT4, NF-kappaB, as well as T-bet activity. 
      UC-MSCs secreted considerable amounts of activin-A, which could suppress IFN-gamma 
      production by NK cells. Neutralization of activin-A in MSC-conditioned media 
      significantly abrogated their suppressive abilities. Till date, multiple groups 
      have reported that prostaglandin (PG)-E2 produced by MSCs can suppress NK cell 
      functions. Indeed, we found that inhibition of PGE2 production by MSCs could also 
      significantly restore IFN-gamma production. However, the effects of activin-A and 
      PGE2 were not cumulative. To the best of our knowledge, we are first to report 
      the role of activin-A in MSC-mediated suppression of IFN-gamma production by NK 
      cells.

TI  - Functional phenotype of synovial monocytes modulating inflammatory T-cell 
      responses in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
PG  - e109775
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0109775 [doi]
LID - e109775
AB  - Monocytes function as crucial innate effectors in the pathogenesis of chronic 
      inflammatory diseases, including autoimmunity, as well as in the inflammatory 
      response against infectious pathogens. Human monocytes are heterogeneous and can 
      be classified into three distinct subsets based on CD14 and CD16 expression. 
      Although accumulating evidence suggests distinct functions of monocyte subsets in 
      inflammatory conditions, their pathogenic roles in autoimmune diseases remain 
      unclear. Thus, we investigated the phenotypic and functional characteristics of 
      monocytes derived from synovial fluid and peripheral blood in RA patients in 
      order to explore the pathogenic roles of these cells. In RA patients, CD14+CD16+, 
      but not CD14dimCD16+, monocytes are predominantly expanded in synovial fluid and, 
      to a lesser degree, in peripheral blood. Expression of co-signaling molecules of 
      the B7 family, specifically CD80 and CD276, was markedly elevated on synovial 
      monocytes, while peripheral monocytes of RA and healthy controls did not express 
      these molecules without stimulation. To explore how synovial monocytes might gain 
      these unique properties in the inflammatory milieu of the synovial fluid, 
      peripheral monocytes were exposed to various stimuli. CD16 expression on CD14+ 
      monocytes was clearly induced by TGF-beta, although co-treatment with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, 
      or IL-6 did not result in any additive effects. In contrast, TLR stimulation with 
      LPS or zymosan significantly downregulated CD16 expression such that the 
      CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset could not be identified. Furthermore, treatment of 
      monocytes with IFN-gamma resulted in the induction of CD80 and HLA-DR expression even 
      in the presence of TGF-beta. An in vitro assay clearly showed that synovial 
      monocytes possess the unique capability to promote Th1 as well as Th17 responses 
      of autologous peripheral CD4 memory T cells. Our findings suggest that the 
      cytokine milieu of the synovial fluid shapes the unique features of synovial 
      monocytes as well as their cardinal role in shaping inflammatory T-cell responses 
      in RA.

AB  - Life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) limits the use of 
      HLA-C-mismatched unrelated donors in transplantation. Clinicians lack criteria 
      for donor selection when HLA-C-mismatched donors are a patient's only option for 
      cure. We examined the role for HLA-C expression levels to identify permissible 
      HLA-C mismatches. The median fluorescence intensity, a proxy of HLA-C expression, 
      was assigned to each HLA-C allotype in 1975 patients and their HLA-C-mismatched 
      unrelated transplant donors. The association of outcome with the level of 
      expression of patients' and donors' HLA-C allotypes was evaluated in 
      multivariable models. Increasing expression level of the patient's mismatched 
      HLA-C allotype was associated with increased risks of grades III to IV acute 
      GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, and mortality. Increasing expression level among 
      HLA-C mismatches with residue 116 or residue 77/80 mismatching was associated 
      with increased nonrelapse mortality. The immunogenicity of HLA-C mismatches in 
      unrelated donor transplantation is influenced by the expression level of the 
      patient's mismatched HLA-C allotype. HLA-C expression levels provide new 
      information on mismatches that should be avoided and extend understanding of 
      HLA-C-mediated immune responses in human disease.

AB  - Clonal structure of the human peripheral T-cell repertoire is shaped by a number 
      of homeostatic mechanisms, including antigen presentation, cytokine and cell 
      regulation. Its accurate tuning leads to a remarkable ability to combat pathogens 
      in all their variety, while systemic failures may lead to severe consequences 
      like autoimmune diseases. Here we develop and make use of a non-parametric 
      statistical approach to assess T cell clonal size distributions from recent next 
      generation sequencing data. For 41 healthy individuals and a patient with 
      ankylosing spondylitis, who undergone treatment, we invariably find power law 
      scaling over several decades and for the first time calculate quantitatively 
      meaningful values of decay exponent. It has proved to be much the same among 
      healthy donors, significantly different for an autoimmune patient before the 
      therapy, and converging towards a typical value afterwards. We discuss 
      implications of the findings for theoretical understanding and mathematical 
      modeling of adaptive immunity.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has great potential for both regenerative medicine 
      and immunotherapy due to its multipotency and immunomodulatory property. The 
      derivation of MSCs from human tissues involves an invasive procedure and the 
      obtained MSCs often suffer from inconsistent quality. To overcome these issues, 
      the approaches of deriving a highly potent and replenishable population of MSCs 
      from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were established. However, few studies 
      compared the immunological characteristics of MSCs derived from hESCs with 
      tissue-derived MSCs or demonstrated differences and the underlying mechanisms. 
      Here, we differentiated H9 hESCs into MSC-like cells (H9-MSCs) through an 
      embryoid body outgrowth method and compared the immunological characteristics of 
      H9-MSCs with bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). Both sources of derived cells 
      exhibited typical MSC morphologies and surface marker expressions, as well as 
      multipotency to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. A 
      immunological characterization study showed that H9-MSCs and BMSCs had similar 
      immunoprivileged properties without triggering allogeneic lymphocyte 
      proliferation as well as equivalent immunosuppressive effects on T-cell 
      proliferation induced by either cellular or mitogenic stimuli. Flow cytometry 
      analysis revealed a lower expression of human major histocompatability complex 
      class II molecule human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and a higher expression of 
      coinhibitory molecule B7-H1 in H9-MSCs than in BMSCs. Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) is 
      a proinflammatory cytokine that can induce the expression of HLA class II 
      molecules in many cell types. Our results showed that pretreatment of H9-MSCs and 
      BMSCs with IFN-gamma did not change their immunogenicity and immunosuppressive 
      abilities, but increased the difference between H9-MSCs and BMSCs for their 
      expression of HLA-DR. Further detection of expression of molecules involved in 
      IFN-gamma signaling pathways suggested that the lower expression of HLA-DR in H9-MSCs 
      could be partially attributed to the lower expression and the less nuclear 
      translocation of its transcriptional factor CIITA. The present study provides 
      evidence that the hESC-derived MSCs share similar immunogenicity and 
      immunosuppressive abilities with BMSCs, but differ in the expression profile of 
      immunological markers and the responsiveness to certain inflammatory cytokines, 
      which suggests that H9-MSCs could be a safe and efficient candidate for MSC 
      treatment in patients with inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Mathematical model of renal interstitial fibrosis.
PG  - 14193-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1413970111 [doi]
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is an autoimmune disease that occurs when autoantibodies 
      complex with self-antigen and form immune complexes that accumulate in the 
      glomeruli. These immune complexes initiate an inflammatory response resulting in 
      glomerular injury. LN often concomitantly affects the tubulointerstitial 
      compartment of the kidney, leading first to interstitial inflammation and 
      subsequently to interstitial fibrosis and atrophy of the renal tubules if not 
      appropriately treated. Presently the only way to assess interstitial inflammation 
      and fibrosis is through kidney biopsy, which is invasive and cannot be repeated 
      frequently. Hence, monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy is 
      suboptimal. In this paper we describe a mathematical model of the progress from 
      tubulointerstitial inflammation to fibrosis. We demonstrate how the model can be 
      used to monitor treatments for interstitial fibrosis in LN with drugs currently 
      being developed or used for nonrenal fibrosis.

TI  - Natural killer cell crosstalk with allogeneic human cardiac-derived 
      stem/progenitor cells controls persistence.
PG  - 290-302
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvu208 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Allogeneic human cardiac-derived stem/progenitor cells (hCPC) are promising 
      candidates for cardiac repair. They interact with T cells, major effectors of the 
      adaptive immune response, inducing 'paracrine' anti-inflammatory effects that 
      could sustain tissue repair/regeneration. Natural killer (NK) cells are major 
      effectors of the innate immune system that might influence the persistence of 
      therapeutic stem/progenitor cells. Therefore, to get through successful clinical 
      translation and anticipate allogeneic hCPC persistence, we defined their 
      crosstalk with NK cells under steady state and inflammatory conditions. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: By using an experimental model of allogeneic hCPC/NK cell 
      interaction, we demonstrate that hCPC moderately trigger cytokine-activated, but 
      not resting, NK cell killing that occurs through formation of lytic immunological 
      synapse and NK cell natural cytotoxicity. Yet, inflammatory context substantially 
      decreases their capacity to set cytokine-activated NK cell functions towards NK 
      cell-cytotoxicity and protects hCPC from NK cell killing. Allogeneic hCPC also 
      restrain NK cell-cytotoxicity against conventional targets and inflammatory 
      cytokine secretion biasing the latter towards anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, 
      hCPC are unprivileged targets for allogeneic NK cells and can restrain NK cell 
      functions in allogeneic setting. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data suggest that 
      allogeneic hCPC/innate NK cells crosstalk within injured inflamed myocardium 
      would permit their retention and might contribute to attenuating inflammation and 
      to preventing adverse cardiac remodelling.

AB  - Isolated microvessel-residing pericytes and pericytes from human pluripotent stem 
      cells (hPSCs) exhibit mesenchymal stem cell-like characteristics and therapeutic 
      properties. Despite growing interest in pericyte-based stem cell therapy, their

      poorly defined, in particular those of vasculogenic hPSC pericytes. We found that

      constitutively expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and the 
      inhibitory programmed cell death-ligand 1/2 (PD-L1/2) molecules but not MHC class 
      II or CD80/CD86 costimulatory molecules. Pretreatment with inflammatory mediators 
      failed to induce an antigen-presenting cell-like phenotype in stimulated 
      pericytes. CD146+ pericytes from hPSCs did not induce activation and 
      proliferation of allogeneic resting T cells independent of interferon (IFN)-gamma 
      prestimulation, similarly to pericytes from human brain or placenta. Instead, 
      pericytes mediated a significant increase in the frequency of allogeneic 
      CD25highFoxP3+ regulatory T cells when cocultured with nonactivated peripheral 
      blood T cells. Furthermore, when peripheral blood CD25high regulatory T cells 
      (Tregs) were depleted from isolated CD3+ T cells, pericytes preferentially 
      induced de novo formation of CD4+CD25highFoxP3+CD127-, suppressive regulatory T 
      cells. Constitutive expression of PD-L1/2 and secretion of transforming growth 
      factor-beta by hPSC pericytes directly regulated generation of pericyte-induced 
      Tregs. Pericytes cotransplanted into immunodeficient mice with allogeneic CD25- T 
      cells maintained a nonimmunogenic phenotype and mediated the development of 
      functional regulatory T cells. Together, these findings reveal a novel feature of 
      pericyte-mediated immunomodulation distinguished from immunosuppression, shared 
      by native tissue pericytes and hPSC pericytes, and support the notion that 
      pericytes can be applied for allogeneic cell therapy.

AB  - In the present study, we compared mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from 4 
      different sources, human bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), umbilical cord 
      Wharton's Jelly (WJ) and the placenta (PL), in order to determine which 
      population of MSCs displayed the most prominent immunosuppressive effects on 
      phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell proliferation, and which one had the highest 
      proliferative and differentiation potential. MSC and T lymphocyte co-culture 
      (mixed culture) was used to determine whether the MSCs inhibit T cell 
      proliferation, as well as which population of MSCs has the strongest inhibitory 
      ability. The expression of immune-related genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and 
      RT-qPCR. The proliferation and differentiation potential of the MSCs were 
      determined using standard methods. Following MSC and T cell co-culture, 
      mitogen-induced T cell proliferation was effectively suppressed by all 4 
      populations of MSCs. This occurred through soluble factors rather than direct 
      contact inhibition. Among the 4 populations of MSCs, the WJ-MSC has the strongest 
      suppression effects. On immune related genes, WJ-MSC has the weakest expression 
      of MHC II genes, TLR4, TLR3, JAG1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3. To compare the 
      proliferation potential, WJ-MSCs showed the most rapid growth rate followed by 
      the AT-, PL- and BM-MSCs. As regards differentiation potential, the WJ-MSCs had 
      the strongest osteogenetic ability followed by PL, AT and BM-MSC. AT-MSC has the 
      strongest adipogenetic ability followed by the WJ-, BM- and PL-MSCs. These data 
      indicated that the WJ-MSCs had the strongest immunomodulatory and 
      immunosuppressive potential. In light of these observations, we suggest that 
      WJ-MSCs are the most attractive cell population for use in immune cellular 
      therapy when immunosuppressive action is required.

TI  - Enhanced neutrophil extracellular trap generation in rheumatoid arthritis: 
      analysis of underlying signal transduction pathways and potential diagnostic 
      utility.
PG  - R122
LID - 10.1186/ar4579 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been implicated 
      in a number of autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We 
      examined the underlying signaling pathways triggering enhanced NETosis in RA and 
      ascertained whether the products of NETosis had diagnostic implications or 
      usefulness. METHODS: Neutrophils were isolated from RA patients with active 
      disease and from controls. Spontaneous NET formation from RA and control 
      neutrophils was assessed in vitro with microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) for NETosis-derived products. The analysis of the 
      signal-transduction cascade included reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, 
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 
      (PAD4), and citrullinated histone 3 (citH3). NET formation was studied in 
      response to serum and synovial fluid and immunoglobulin G (IgG) depleted and 
      reconstituted serum. Serum was analyzed for NETosis-derived products, for which 
      receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Neutrophils from RA cases exhibited increased spontaneous NET formation in vitro, 
      associated with elevated ROS production, enhanced NE and MPO expression, nuclear 
      translocation of PAD4, PAD4-mediated citrullination of H3, and altered nuclear 
      morphology. NET formation in both anti-citrullinated peptide antibody 
      (ACPA)-positive and -negative RA was abolished by IgG depletion, but restored 
      only with ACPA-positive IgG. NETosis-derived products in RA serum demonstrated 
      diagnostic potential, the ROC area under the curve for cell-free nucleosomes 
      being >97%, with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 92%. No significant 
      difference was observed between ACPA-positive and -negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Signaling elements associated with the extrusion of NETs are significantly 
      enhanced to promote NETosis in RA compared with healthy controls. NETosis 
      depended on the presence of ACPA in ACPA-positive RA serum. The quantitation of 
      NETosis-derived products, such as cell-free nucleosomes in serum, may be a useful 
      complementary tool to discriminate between healthy controls and RA cases.

AB  - Evaluation of the immunogenicity of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in an 
      allogeneic setting during therapy has been hampered by lack of suitable models 
      due to technical and ethical limitations. Here, we show that allogeneic human 
      umbilical cord blood derived-MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) maintained low immunogenicity even 
      after immune challenge in vitro. To confirm these properties in vivo, a humanized 
      mouse model was established by injecting isolated hUCB-derived CD34+ cells 
      intravenously into immunocompromised NOD/SCID IL2gammanull (NSG) mice. After repeated 
      intravenous injection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) or 
      MRC5 cells into these mice, immunological alterations including T cell 
      proliferation and increased IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and human IgG levels, were observed. In 
      contrast, hUCB-MSC injection did not elicit these responses. While lymphocyte 
      infiltration in the lung and small intestine and reduced survival rates were 
      observed after hPBMC or MRC5 transplantation, no adverse events were observed 
      following hUCB-MSC introduction. In conclusion, our data suggest that allogeneic 
      hUCB-MSCs have low immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo, and are therefore 
      "immunologically safe" for use in allogeneic clinical applications.

TI  - Human skin-derived precursor cells are poorly immunogenic and modulate the 
      allogeneic immune response.
PG  - 2215-28
LID - 10.1002/stem.1692 [doi]
AB  - Human skin-derived precursors (hSKPs) are multipotent somatic stem cells that 
      persist within the dermis throughout adulthood and harbor potential clinical 
      applicability. In this study, we investigated their immunogenicity and 
      immunosuppressive features, both in vitro and in vivo. As such, this study 
      provides a solid basis for developing their future clinical applications. We 
      found that hSKPs express HLA-ABC molecules, but not HLA-DR, rendering them poorly 
      immunogenic. Using a coculture set-up, we could further demonstrate that hSKPs 
      inhibit the proliferation of allogeneic activated T cells and alter their 
      cytokine secretion profile, in a dose-dependent manner. Cotransplantation of hSKP 
      and human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) into severe combined immune-deficient 
      mice also showed a significant impairment of the graft-versus-host response 1 
      week post-transplantation and a drastic increase in survival time of 60%. From a 
      mechanistic point of view, we found that hSKPs require cell contact as well as 
      secretion of soluble inhibitory factors in order to modulate the immune response. 
      The expression/secretion levels of these factors further increases upon 
      inflammation or in the presence of activated T cells. As such, we believe that 
      these features could be beneficial in a later allogeneic clinical setting, 
      because rejection of engrafted allogeneic hSKP might be delayed or even avoided 
      due to their own promotion of a tolerogenic microenvironment.

TI  - Neural progenitor cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells generated less 
      autogenous immune response.

AB  - The breakthrough development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) raises the 
      prospect of patient-specific treatment for many diseases through the replacement 
      of affected cells. However, whether iPSC-derived functional cell lineages 
      generate a deleterious immune response upon auto-transplantation remains unclear. 
      In this study, we differentiated five human iPSC lines from skin fibroblasts and 
      urine cells into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and analyzed their 
      immunogenicity. Through co-culture with autogenous peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs), we showed that both somatic cells and iPSC-derived NPCs do not 
      stimulate significant autogenous PBMC proliferation. However, a significant 
      immune reaction was detected when these cells were co-cultured with allogenous 
      PBMCs. Furthermore, no significant expression of perforin or granzyme B was 
      detected following stimulation of autogenous immune effector cells (CD3(+)CD8(-) 
      T cells, CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells or CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells) by NPCs in both PBMC and 
      T cell co-culture systems. These results suggest that human iPSC-derived NPCs may 
      not initiate an immune response in autogenous transplants, and thus set a base 
      for further preclinical evaluation of human iPSCs.

AB  - Adoptive T-cell therapy of cancer is a treatment strategy where T cells are 
      isolated, activated, in some cases engineered, and expanded ex vivo before being 
      reinfused to the patient. The most commonly used T-cell expansion methods are 
      either anti-CD3/CD28 antibody beads or the "rapid expansion protocol" (REP), 
      which utilizes OKT-3, interleukin (IL)-2, and irradiated allogeneic feeder cells. 
      However, REP-expanded or bead-expanded T cells are sensitive to the harsh tumor 
      microenvironment and often short-lived after reinfusion. Here, we demonstrate 
      that when irradiated and preactivated allosensitized allogeneic lymphocytes 
      (ASALs) are used as helper cells to license OKT3-armed allogeneic mature 
      dendritic cells (DCs), together they expand target T cells of high quality. The 
      ASAL/DC combination yields an enriched Th1-polarizing cytokine environment 
      (interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-12, IL-2) and optimal costimulatory signals for T-cell 
      stimulation. When genetically engineered antitumor T cells were expanded by this 
      coculture system, they showed better survival and cytotoxic efficacy under 
      oxidative stress and immunosuppressive environment, as well as superior 
      proliferative response during tumor cell killing compared to the REP protocol. 
      Our result suggests a robust ex vivo method to expand T cells with improved 
      quality for adoptive cancer immunotherapy.

      short hairpin RNA to CCR5 and the C46 fusion inhibitor.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1038/mtm.2013.11 [doi]
AB  - Gene transfer has therapeutic potential for treating HIV-1 infection by 
      generating cells that are resistant to the virus. We have engineered a novel 
      self-inactivating lentiviral vector, LVsh5/C46, using two viral-entry inhibitors 
      to block early steps of HIV-1 cycle. The LVsh5/C46 vector encodes a short hairpin 
      RNA (shRNA) for downregulation of CCR5, in combination with the HIV-1 fusion 
      inhibitor, C46. We demonstrate here the effective delivery of LVsh5/C46 to human 
      T cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes, 
      and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). CCR5-targeted shRNA (sh5) 
      and C46 peptide were stably expressed in the target cells and were able to 
      effectively protect gene-modified cells against infection with CCR5- and 
      CXCR4-tropic strains of HIV-1. LVsh5/C46 treatment was nontoxic as assessed by 
      cell growth and viability, was noninflammatory, and had no adverse effect on HSPC 
      differentiation. LVsh5/C46 could be produced at a scale sufficient for clinical 
      development and resulted in active viral particles with very low mutagenic 
      potential and the absence of replication-competent lentivirus. Based on these in 
      vitro results, plus additional in vivo safety and efficacy data, LVsh5/C46 is now 
      being tested in a phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of HIV-1 disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Our previous study has demonstrated the stem cell-like 
      properties of human umbilical cord lining epithelial cells (CLECs) and their 
      capability for epidermal reconstitution in organotypic skin culture; however, the 
      immunogenicity of these cells has not been clearly defined. We assessed several 
      aspects of the immune properties of CLECs in vitro. METHODS: We examined CLECs 
      for their immunoregulatory function in a mixed lymphocyte culture experiment. 
      We characterized the expression patterns of the major histocompatibility complex 
      (MHC), co-stimulatory molecules and the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines and 
      growth factors in CLECs by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction, Western blotting, flow cytometry and FlowCytomix multiple analyte 
      detection assays. RESULTS: CLECs were found not to induce but to suppress the 
      proliferation response of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a mixed 
      lymphocyte culture assay. They did not express the MHC class II antigen HLA-DR 
      but the non-classic MHC class I antigens HLA-G and HLA-E and lacked the 
      expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. In addition, they 
      produced less interleukin-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta1 but more 
      interleukin-4 and hepatocyte growth factor than did adult keratinocytes, a 
      pattern in favor of wound healing with less inflammation response. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our data suggest that CLECs have an immunosuppressive function in addition to 
      their low immunogenicity. This could be at least partially explained by their 
      expression of HLA-G and HLA-E molecules associated with immune tolerance and 
      absence of HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules. The demonstration that CLECs 
      produce a favorable pattern of cytokines and growth factors for wound healing 
      provides further support for their potential clinical application in allogeneic 
      cell therapy.

AB  - Islet transplantation involves the transplantation of pancreatic islets from the 
      pancreas of a donor to another individual. It has proven to be an effective 
      method for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, islet transplantation is 
      hampered by immune rejection, as well as the shortage of donor islets. Human 
      umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUMSCs) are an 
      ideal cell source for use in transplantation due to their biological 
      characteristics and their use does not provoke any ethical issues. In this study, 
      we investigated the immunological characteristics of HUMSCs and their effects on 
      lymphocyte proliferation and the secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma, and explored 
      whether direct cell-to-cell interactions and soluble factors, such as IFN-gamma were 
      important for balancing HUMSC-mediated immune regulation. We transplanted HUMSCs 
      into diabetic rats to investigate whether these cells can colonize in vivo and 
      differentiate into pancreatic beta-cells, and whether the hyperglycemia of diabetic 
      rats can be improved by transplantation. Our results revealed that HUMSCs did not 
      stimulate the proliferation of lymphocytes and did not induce allogeneic or 
      xenogeneic immune cell responses. qRT-PCR demonstrated that the HUMSCs produced 
      an immunosuppressive isoform of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) and did not 
      express HLA-DR. Flow cytometry revealed that the HUMSCs did not express immune 
      response-related surface antigens such as, CD40, CD40L, CD80 and CD86. IFN-gamma 
      secretion by human peripheral blood lymphocytes was reduced when the cells were 
      co-cultured with HUMSCs. These results suggest that HUMSCs are tolerated by the 
      host in an allogeneic transplant. We transplanted HUMSCs into diabetic rats, and 
      the cells survived in the liver and pancreas. Hyperglycemia of the diabetic rats 
      was improved and the destruction of pancreatic cells was partly repaired by HUMSC 
      transplantation. Hyperglycemic improvement may be related to the immunomodulatory 
      effects of HUMSCs. However, the exact mechanisms involved remain to be further 
      clarified.

TI  - TLR ligands stimulation protects MSC from NK killing.
PG  - 290-300

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a fundamental role in allograft rejection and 
      graft-versus-host disease through their immunosuppressive abilities. Recently, 
      Toll-like receptors (TLR) have been shown to modulate MSC functions. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of several TLR ligands on the 
      interaction between MSC and natural killer (NK) cells. Our results show that 
      TLR-primed adult bone marrow and embryonic MSC are more resistant than unprimed 
      MSC to IL-2-activated NK-induced killing. Such protection can be explained by the 
      modulation of Natural Killer group 2D ligands major histocompatibility complex 
      class I chain A and ULBP3 and DNAM-1 ligands by TLR-primed MSC. These results 
      indicate that MSCs are able to adapt their immuno-behavior in an inflammatory 
      context, decreasing their susceptibility to NK killing. In addition, TLR3 but not 
      TLR4-primed MSC enhance their suppressive functions against NK cells. However, 
      the efficiency of this response is heterogeneous, even if the phenotypes of 
      different analyzed MSC are rather homogeneous. The consequences could be 
      important in MSC-mediated cell therapy, since the heterogeneity of adult MSC 
      responders may be explored in order to select the more efficient responders.

TI  - In vitro testing of immunosupressive effects of mesenchymal stromal cells on 
      lymphocytes stimulated with alloantigens.
PG  - 215-9
LID - 10.5507/bp.2013.072 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) derived from adult bone marrow or adipose 
      tissue offer the potential to open a new frontier in medicine. MSC are involved 
      in modulating immune response and tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. 
      Experimental evidence and preliminary clinical studies have demonstrated that MSC 
      exhibit an important immunomodulatory function in patients with graft versus host 
      disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The 
      immunosuppressive properties of MSC have already been exploited in the clinical 
      setting. However the precise mechanisms are being still investigated. METHODS: We 
      examined the immunosuppressive function of MSC by coculturing them with 
      stimulated HLA incompatible allogeneic lymphocytes in a mixed lymphocyte culture 
      test. The metabolic and proliferative activity of lymphocytes was determined by 
      MTT test. RESULTS: After stimulation with alloantigens the presence of MSC caused 
      significant decrease of absorbance levels by 62% (P<0.01), 26% (P<0.01) and 6% 
      (P=0.0437) in comparison to positive control depending on the MSC/lymphocyte 
      ratio (1:5, 1:50, 1:500). The mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes with fMLP or 
      PHA was also significantly reduced during MSC cocultivation. The absorbance was 
      reduced by 42% (P<0.001) and 67% (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic bone marrow 
      is an ideal source of MSC for clinical application. The experiments confirmed the 
      dose-dependent inhibitory effect of MSC on lymphocyte proliferation triggered by 
      cellular or mitogenic stimulation. The mixed lymphocyte culture test offers a 
      simple method for characterization and verification of the immunosuppressive 
      potential of MSC, being prepared for clinical use.

TI  - CD39-mediated effect of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells on the 
      human Th17 cell function.
PG  - 357-65
LID - 10.1007/s11302-013-9385-0 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the immune-modulatory effects of human bone 
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) on human Th17 cell function 
      through the CD39-mediated adenosine-producing pathway. The suppressive effects of 
      hBMSCs were evaluated by assessing their effects on the proliferation of Th17 
      cells and the secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17A by Th17 
      cells with or without anti-CD39 treatment. Changes in CD39 and CD73 expression on 
      the T cells with or without co-culture of hBMSCs were evaluated by flow 
      cytometry. hBMSCs effectively suppressed the proliferation of Th17 cells and the 
      secretion of both IL-17A and IFN-gamma from Th17 cells using by both flow cytometry 
      and ELISA, while anti-CD39 treatment significantly reduced the inhibitory effects 
      of hBMSCs on the proliferation and secretion of the Th17 cells. The hBMSCs 
      induced increased expression of the CD39 and CD73 on T cells correlated with the 
      suppressive function of hBMSCs, which was accompanied by increased adenosine 
      production. Our data suggests that hBMSCs can effectively suppress immune 
      responses of the Th17 cells via the CD39-CD73-mediated adenosine-producing 
      pathway.

TI  - Adult and cord blood endothelial progenitor cells have different gene expression 
      profiles and immunogenic potential.
PG  - s367-74
LID - 10.2450/2013.0042-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) are endowed with vascular 
      regenerative ability in vivo and in vitro. In this study we compared the 
      genotypic profile and the immunogenic potential of adult and cord blood ECFC, in 
      order to explore the feasibility of using them as a cell therapy product. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: ECFC were obtained from cord blood samples not suitable 
      for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and from adult healthy blood donors 
      after informed consent. Genotypes were analysed by commercially available 
      microarray assays and results were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction analysis. HLA antigen expression was evaluated by flow-cytometry. 
      Immunogenic capacity was investigated by evaluating the activation of allogeneic 
      lymphocytes and monocytes in co-cultures with ECFC. RESULTS: Microarray assays 
      revealed that the genetic profile of cord blood and adult ECFC differed in about 
      20% of examined genes. We found that cord blood ECFC were characterised by lower 
      pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic gene expression as compared to adult ECFC. 
      Furthermore, whereas cord blood and adult ECFCs expressed similar amount of HLA 
      molecules both at baseline and after incubation with gamma-interferon, cord blood 
      ECFC elicited a weaker expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. Finally, we 
      observed no differences in the amount of HLA antigens expressed among cord blood 
      ECFC, adult ECFC and mesenchymal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest 
      that cord blood ECFC have a lower pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic profile 
      than adult ECFC. These preliminary data offer level-headed evidence to use cord 
      blood ECFC as a cell therapy product in vascular diseases.

TI  - Osteogenic differentiated periodontal ligament stem cells maintain their 
      immunomodulatory capacity.
PG  - 226-32
LID - 10.1002/term.1516 [doi]
AB  - Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) have great potential for regenerating 
      periodontal ligament tissue, which is involved in attaching teeth to the 
      underlying alveolar bone. Recently, PDLSCs were characterized as having both low 
      immunogenicity and profound immunomodulation abilities. Further, transplanted 
      PDLSCs differentiate into osteoblasts in vivo. In the present study, we 
      investigated the immunological characteristics of osteogenic differentiated 
      PDLSCs. We found that PDLSCs expressed mesenchymal stem cells markers, including 
      STRO-1 and CD146, but were negative for CD14, CD34 and CD45. RT-PCR indicated 
      that NCAM1, MSX1 and S100A4 were expressed in PDLSCs. The cells underwent 
      osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation when cultured in defined medium. 
      Osteogenic differentiated PDLSCs failed to stimulate allogeneic T cell 
      proliferation and suppressed phytohaemagglutinin-triggered T cell proliferation. 
      Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, restored the T 
      cell proliferation inhibited by osteogenic differentiated PDLSCs. These data 
      confirm that osteogenic differentiated PDLSCs have low immunogenicity and 
      demonstrate that they suppress T cell proliferation in vitro through secretion of 
      PGE2.
