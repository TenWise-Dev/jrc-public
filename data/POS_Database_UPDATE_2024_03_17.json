        "abstract": "Insulin is an essential regulator of blood glucose homeostasis that is produced exclusively bybetacells within the pancreatic islets of healthy individuals. In those affected by diabetes, immune inflammation, damage, and destruction of isletbetacells leads to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Current efforts to understand the mechanisms underlyingbetacell damage in diabetes rely onin vitro-cultured cadaveric islets. However, isolation of these islets involves removal of crucial matrix and vasculature that supports islets in the intact pancreas. Unsurprisingly, these islets demonstrate reduced functionality over time in standard culture conditions, thereby limiting their value for understanding native islet biology. Leveraging a novel, vascularized micro-organ (VMO) approach, we have recapitulated elements of the native pancreas by incorporating isolated human islets within a three-dimensional matrix nourished by living, perfusable blood vessels. Importantly, these islets show long-term viability and maintain robust glucose-stimulated insulin responses. Furthermore, vessel-mediated delivery of immune cells to these tissues provides a model to assess islet-immune cell interactions and subsequent islet killing-key steps in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. Together, these results establish the islet-VMO as a novel,ex vivoplatform for studying human islet biology in both health and disease."

        "abstract": "It is imperative to develop and implement newer, more effective strategies to address refractory diabetic wounds. As of now, there is currently no optimal solution for these wounds. Hypoxic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)-derived exosomes have been postulated to promote diabetic wound healing, however, its effect and molecular mechanism need further study. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether hypoxic exosomes enhance wound healing in diabetics. Based on our high-throughput sequencing, differentially expressed lncRNAs (including 64 upregulated lncRNAs and 94 downregulated lncRNAs) were found in hypoxic exosomes compared to normoxic exosomes. Interestingly, lncHAR1B was one of the prominently upregulated lncRNAs in hypoxic exosomes, showing a notable correlation with diabetic wound healing. More specifically, hypoxic exosomes were transmitted to surrounding cells, which resulted in a significant increase in lncHAR1B level, thereby relieving the dysfunction of endothelial cells and promoting the switch from M1 to M2 macrophages under high glucose conditions. Mechanistically, lncHAR1B directly interacted with the transcription factor basic helix-loop-helix family member e23 (BHLHE23), which subsequently led to its binding to the KLF transcription factor 4 (KLF4) and promoted KLF4 expression. In our in vivo experiments, the use of hypoxic exosomes-loaded HGM-QCS hydrogels (Gel-H-Exos) resulted in rapid wound healing compared to that of normoxic exosomes-loaded HGM-QCS hydrogels (Gel-N-Exos) and diabetic groups. Consequently, our study provides potentially novel therapeutic approaches aimed at accelerating wound healing and developing a practical exosomes delivery platform."

The performance of a new point-of-care CE-IVD (In Vitro Diagnostic) marked isothermal lab-on-phone lactose intolerance assay, using crude samples, was assessed in comparison with Sanger sequencing using purified DNA, as reference method. METHODS: The study was conducted following a non-probability sampling using direct buccal swab (n = 63) and capillary blood (n = 43) clinical samples from a total of 63 volunteers. A 3 x 3 confusion matrix/contingency table was used to evaluate the performance of the isothermal lab-on-phone lactose intolerance assay. RESULTS: The isothermal lab-on-phone lactose intolerance assay successfully detected the -13910 C/T variant with a limit of detection of 5 cells/assay and demonstrated an overall accuracy of 98.41% (95% CI, 91.47%-99.96%) for buccal swab samples and 100% (95% CI, 91.19%-100%) for capillary blood, taking just 90 min from sample to result, with only 2 min hands-on. CONCLUSIONS: The lab-on-phone pocket-sized assay displayed good performance when using direct buccal swab and capillary blood samples, enabling a low-cost, real-time, and accurate genotyping of the -13910 C/T region for the rapid diagnosis of primary lactose intolerance at point-of-care, which enables a prompt implementation of appropriate diet habits and/or intolerance therapies. To our knowledge, this is the first point-of-care genetic test for lactose intolerance to be made available on the market."

To ameliorate oxidative stress and applying antioxidant treatment in the wound site, we explore the function of folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), a mitochondrial gatekeeper protein works to alter mitochondrial morphology, reduce oxidative phosphorylation and protect cells from unwarranted ROS accumulation. And our in vitro experiments showed the effects of FNIP1 in ameliorating oxidative stress and rescued impaired angiogenesis of HUVECs in high glucose environment. To realize the drug delivery and local regulation of FNIP1 in diabetic wound sites, a novel designed glucose-responsive HA-PBA-FA/EN106 hydrogel is introduced for improving diabetic wound healing. Due to the dynamic phenylboronate ester structure with a phenylboronic acid group between hyaluronic acid (HA) and phenylboronic acid (PBA), the hydrogel is able to realize a glucose-responsive release of drugs. Fulvic acid (FA) is added in the hydrogel, which not only severs as crosslinking agent but also provides antibacterial and anti-inflammatory abilities. Moreover, the release of FEM1b-FNIP1 axis inhibitor EN106 ameliorated oxidative stress and stimulated angiogenesis through FEM1b-FNIP1 axis regulation. These in vivo and in vitro results demonstrated that accelerated diabetic wounds repair with the use of the HA-PBA-FA/EN106 hydrogel, which may provide a promising strategy for chronic diabetic wound repair."

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) interferon-gamma release assay with wild-type spike, membrane and nucleocapsid peptide pools, we longitudinally characterized functional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses in a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe COVID-19. All patients were included before emergence of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. Our most important finding was an impaired development of early IFN-gamma-secreting virus-specific T-cells in severe patients compared to patients with moderate disease, indicating that absence of virus-specific cellular responses in the acute phase may act as a prognostic factor for severe disease. Remarkably, in addition to reactivity against the spike protein, a substantial proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response was directed against the conserved membrane protein. This may be relevant for diagnostics and vaccine design, especially considering new variants with heavily mutated spike proteins. Our data further strengthen the hypothesis that dysregulated adaptive immunity plays a central role in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis."

        "abstract": "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) can elicit a wide variety of human diseases such as hand, foot, and mouth disease and severe or fatal neurological complications. It is not clearly understood what determines the virulence and fitness of EV-A71. It has been observed that amino acid changes in the receptor binding protein, VP1, resulting in viral binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) may be important for the ability of EV-A71 to infect neuronal tissue. In this study, we identified that the presence of glutamine, as opposed to glutamic acid, at VP1-145 is key for viral infection in a 2D human fetal intestinal model, consistent with previous findings in an airway organoid model. Moreover, pre-treatment of EV-A71 particles with low molecular weight heparin to block HSPG-binding significantly reduced the infectivity of two clinical EV-A71 isolates and viral mutants carrying glutamine at VP1-145. Our data indicates that mutations in VP1 leading to HSPG-binding enhances viral replication in the human gut. These mutations resulting in increased production of viral particles at the primary replication site could lead to a higher risk of subsequent neuroinfection. IMPORTANCE: With the near eradication of polio worldwide, polio-like illness (as is increasingly caused by EV-A71 infections) is of emerging concern. EV-A71 is indeed the most neurotropic enterovirus that poses a major threat globally to public health and specifically in infants and young children. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of the virulence and the pathogenicity of this virus. Further, our data also supports the identification of potential therapeutic targets against severe EV-A71 infection especially among infants and young children. Furthermore, our work highlights the key role of HSPG-binding mutations in the disease outcome of EV-A71. Additionally, EV-A71 is not able to infect the gut (the primary replication site in humans) in traditionally used animal models. Thus, our research highlights the need for human-based models to study human viral infections.Graphical Abstract."

We utilize primary human nasal epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface, which recapitulate the heterogeneous cellular population as well as mucociliary clearance functions of the in vivo nasal epithelium, to compare lethal [Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV)] and seasonal (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) HCoVs. All four HCoVs replicate productively in nasal cultures, though replication is differentially modulated by temperature. Infections conducted at 33  degrees C vs. 37  degrees C (reflective of temperatures in the upper and lower airway, respectively) revealed that replication of both seasonal HCoVs (HCoV-NL63 and -229E) is significantly attenuated at 37  degrees C. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replicate at both temperatures, though SARS-CoV-2 replication is enhanced at 33  degrees C late in infection. These HCoVs also diverge significantly in terms of cytotoxicity induced following infection, as the seasonal HCoVs as well as SARS-CoV-2 cause cellular cytotoxicity as well as epithelial barrier disruption, while MERS-CoV does not. Treatment of nasal cultures with type 2 cytokine IL-13 to mimic asthmatic airways differentially impacts HCoV receptor availability as well as replication. MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 expression increases with IL-13 treatment, whereas ACE2, the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, is down-regulated. IL-13 treatment enhances MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E replication but reduces that of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, reflecting the impact of IL-13 on HCoV receptor availability. This study highlights diversity among HCoVs during infection of the nasal epithelium, which is likely to influence downstream infection outcomes such as disease severity and transmissibility."

How canonical and non-canonical autophagy function to control Mtb infection in phagosomes and the cytosol remains unresolved. Macrophages are the main host cell in humans for Mtb. Here we studied the contributions of canonical and non-canonical autophagy in the genetically tractable human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages (iPSDM), using a set of Mtb mutants generated in the same genetic background of the common lab strain H37Rv. We monitored replication of Mtb mutants that are either unable to trigger canonical autophagy (Mtb DeltaesxBA) or reportedly unable to block non-canonical autophagy (Mtb DeltacpsA) in iPSDM lacking either ATG7 or ATG14 using single-cell high-content imaging. We report that deletion of ATG7 by CRISPR-Cas9 in iPSDM resulted in increased replication of wild-type Mtb but not of Mtb DeltaesxBA or Mtb DeltacpsA. We show that deletion of ATG14 resulted in increased replication of both Mtb wild type and the mutant Mtb DeltaesxBA. Using Mtb reporters and quantitative imaging, we identified a role for ATG14 in regulating fusion of phagosomes containing Mtb with lysosomes, thereby enabling intracellular bacteria restriction. We conclude that ATG7 and ATG14 are both required for restricting Mtb replication in human macrophages."

Not only were we able to elicit light-induced intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients from the resulting homozygous monSTIM1(+/+)-hESCs, but we also successfully differentiated them into pancreatic islet-like organoids (PIOs). Upon light stimulation, the beta-cells in these monSTIM1(+/+)-PIOs displayed reversible and reproducible [Ca(2+)](i) transient dynamics. Furthermore, in response to photoexcitation, they secreted human insulin. Light-responsive insulin secretion was similarly observed in monSTIM1(+/+)-PIOs produced from neonatal diabetes (ND) patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Under LED illumination, monSTIM1(+/+)-PIO-transplanted diabetic mice produced human c-peptide.

        "abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) affects nearly 3/4 of women during their lifetime, and its symptoms seriously reduce quality of life. Although Candida albicans is a common commensal, it is unknown if VVC results from a switch from a commensal to pathogenic state, if only some strains can cause VVC, and/or if there is displacement of commensal strains with more pathogenic strains. We studied a set of VVC and colonizing C. albicans strains to identify consistent in vitro phenotypes associated with one group or the other. We find that the strains do not differ in overall genetic profile or behavior in culture media (i.e., multilocus sequence type [MLST] profile, rate of growth, and filamentation), but they show strikingly different behaviors during their interactions with vaginal epithelial cells. Epithelial infections with VVC-derived strains yielded stronger fungal proliferation and shedding of fungi and epithelial cells. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of representative epithelial cell infections with selected pathogenic or commensal isolates identified several differentially activated epithelial signaling pathways, including the integrin, ferroptosis, and type I interferon pathways; the latter has been implicated in damage protection. Strikingly, inhibition of type I interferon signaling selectively increases fungal shedding of strains in the colonizing cohort, suggesting that increased shedding correlates with lower interferon pathway activation. These data suggest that VVC strains may intrinsically have enhanced pathogenic potential via differential elicitation of epithelial responses, including the type I interferon pathway. Therefore, it may eventually be possible to evaluate pathogenic potential in vitro to refine VVC diagnosis. IMPORTANCE Despite a high incidence of VVC, we still have a poor understanding of this female-specific disease whose negative impact on women's quality of life has become a public health issue. It is not yet possible to determine by genotype or laboratory phenotype if a given Candida albicans strain is more or less likely to cause VVC. Here, we show that Candida strains causing VVC induce more fungal shedding from epithelial cells than strains from healthy women. This effect is also accompanied by increased epithelial cell detachment and differential activation of the type I interferon pathway. These distinguishing phenotypes suggest it may be possible to evaluate the VVC pathogenic potential of fungal isolates. This would permit more targeted antifungal treatments to spare commensals and could allow for displacement of pathogenic strains with nonpathogenic colonizers. We expect these new assays to provide a more targeted tool for identifying fungal virulence factors and epithelial responses that control fungal vaginitis."

There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Additional tools are also needed to monitor treatment, including experimental therapies in clinical trials. Comprehensively capturing human physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index, and APACHE II score showed limited performance in predicting the COVID-19 outcome. Instead, the quantification of 321 plasma protein groups at 349 timepoints in 50 critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation revealed 14 proteins that showed trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A predictor trained on proteomic measurements obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7), which was weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors (AUROC 0.81). We tested the established predictor on an independent validation cohort (AUROC 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade. Our study demonstrates that plasma proteomics can give rise to prognostic predictors substantially outperforming current prognostic markers in intensive care."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Following consumption of milk, lactose, a disaccharide of glucose and galactose, is hydrolyzed and absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, hydrolysis and absorption are not always absolute, and some lactose will enter the colon where the gut microbiota is able to hydrolyze lactose and produce metabolic byproducts. METHODS: Here, the impact of lactose on the gut microbiota of healthy adults was examined, using a short-term, in vitro strategy where fecal samples harvested from 18 donors were cultured anaerobically with and without lactose. The data were compiled to identify donor-independent responses to lactose treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Metagenomic sequencing found that the addition of lactose decreased richness and evenness, while enhancing prevalence of the beta-galactosidase gene. Taxonomically, lactose treatment decreased relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and increased lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Streptococcaceae, and the probiotic Bifidobacterium. This corresponded with an increased abundance of the lactate utilizers, Veillonellaceae. These structural changes coincided with increased total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), specifically acetate, and lactate. These results demonstrated that lactose could mediate the gut microbiota of healthy adults in a donor-independent manner, consistent with other described prebiotics, and provided insight into how dietary milk consumption may promote human health through modifications of the gut microbiome."

        "abstract": "The prevalence of diabetes type 1 (T1D) in the world populations is continuously growing. Although treatment methods are improving, the diagnostic is still symptom-based and sometimes far after onset of the disease. In this context, the aim of the study was the search of new biomarkers of the disease in red blood cells (RBCs), until now unexplored. The metabolomic and the lipidomic profile of RBCs from T1D patients and matched healthy controls was determined by NMR spectroscopy, and different multivariate discrimination models were built to select the metabolites and lipids that change most significantly. Relevant metabolites were further confirmed by univariate statistical analysis. Robust separation in the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of RBCs from patients and controls was confirmed by orthogonal projection on latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), random forest analysis, and significance analysis of metabolites (SAM). The main changes were detected in the levels of amino acids, organic acids, creatine and phosphocreatine, lipid change length, and choline derivatives, demonstrating changes in glycolysis, BCAA metabolism, and phospholipid metabolism. Our study proves that robust differences exist in the metabolic and lipidomic profile of RBCs from T1D patients, in comparison with matched healthy individuals. Some changes were similar to alterations found already in RBCs of T2D patients, but others seemed to be specific for type 1 diabetes. Thus, many of the metabolic differences found could be biomarker candidates for an earlier diagnosis or monitoring of patients with T1D."

The aim of the study is to investigate the associations of metal exposure with SUA, hyperuricemia and gout in general adults. METHODS: In this study, the exposure to five blood metals (mercury, manganese, lead, cadmium and selenium) of general adults was analyzed based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2018 (n = 14,871). Linear, logistic and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models were applied to examine the associations of blood metals with gout-related outcomes. Possible dose-response relationships were analyzed through restricted cubic spline regression. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile of blood metals, mercury (quartile 2 and 4), lead (quartile 2, 3, and 4) and selenium (quartile 2 and 4) were found to be positively correlated with SUA and hyperuricemia. Higher levels of mercury and lead were associated with gout, but only those in the fourth quartile had statistical significance (OR [95%CI]: 1.39 [1.10-1.75] and 1.905 [1.41-2.57]) respectively). The WQS index of the blood metals was independently correlated with SUA (beta [95%CI]: 0.17 [0.13-0.20]), hyperuricemia (OR [95%CI]: 1.29 [1.16-1.42]) and gout (OR [95%CI]: 1.35 [1.15-1.58]). Among them, lead was the most heavily weighted component (weight = 0.589 for SUA, 0.482 for hyperuricemia, and 0.527 for gout). In addition, restricted cubic spline regression models showed a linear association of lead with the prevalence of hyperuricemia and gout. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that blood metal mixtures were positively associated with gout-related outcomes, with the greatest effect coming from lead."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, which has a prominent social and economic impact worldwide, shows a largely unexplained male bias for the severity and mortality of the disease. Loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is a risk factor candidate in COVID-19 due to its prior association with many chronic age-related diseases, and its impact on immune gene transcription. METHODS: Publicly available scRNA-seq data of PBMC samples derived from male patients critically ill with COVID-19 were reanalyzed, and LOY status was added to the annotated cells. We further studied LOY in whole blood for 211 COVID-19 patients treated at intensive care units (ICU) from the first and second waves of the pandemic. Of these, 139 patients were subject to cell sorting for LOY analysis in granulocytes, low-density neutrophils (LDNs), monocytes, and PBMCs. RESULTS: Reanalysis of available scRNA-seq data revealed LDNs and monocytes as the cell types most affected by LOY. Subsequently, DNA analysis indicated that 46%, 32%, and 29% of critically ill patients showed LOY above 5% cut-off in LDNs, granulocytes, and monocytes, respectively. Hence, the myeloid lineage that is crucial for the development of severe COVID-19 phenotype is affected by LOY. Moreover, LOY correlated with increasing WHO score (median difference 1.59%, 95% HDI 0.46% to 2.71%, p=0.025), death during ICU treatment (median difference 1.46%, 95% HDI 0.47% to 2.43%, p=0.0036), and history of vessel disease (median difference 2.16%, 95% HDI 0.74% to 3.7%, p=0.004), among other variables. In 16 recovered patients, sampled during ICU stay and 93-143 days later, LOY decreased significantly in whole blood and PBMCs. Furthermore, the number of LDNs at the recovery stage decreased dramatically (median difference 76.4 per 10,000 cell sorting events, 95% HDI 55.5 to 104, p=6e-11). CONCLUSIONS: We present a link between LOY and an acute, life-threatening infectious disease. Furthermore, this study highlights LOY as the most prominent clonal mutation affecting the myeloid cell lineage during emergency myelopoiesis. The correlation between LOY level and COVID-19 severity might suggest that this mutation affects the functions of monocytes and neutrophils, which could have consequences for male innate immunity."

Multiplex cytokine profiling indicated slightly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in recovered individuals in contrast to patients with LCS. Plasma proteomics demonstrated low levels of acute phase proteins and macrophage-derived secreted proteins in LCS. High levels of anti-inflammatory oxylipins including omega-3 fatty acids in LCS were detected by eicosadomics, whereas targeted metabolic profiling indicated high levels of anti-inflammatory osmolytes taurine and hypaphorine, but low amino acid and triglyceride levels and deregulated acylcarnitines. A model considering alternatively polarized macrophages as a major contributor to these molecular alterations is presented."

Dysfunctional innate immune responses have been identified to contribute to COVID-19 severity, but the key regulators are still unknown. Here, we present an integrative single-cell multi-omics analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from hospitalized and convalescent COVID-19 patients. In classical monocytes, we identified genes that were potentially regulated by differential chromatin accessibility. Then, sub-clustering and motif-enrichment analyses revealed disease condition-specific regulation by transcription factors and their targets, including an interaction between C/EBPs and a long-noncoding RNA LUCAT1, which we validated through loss-of-function experiments. Finally, we investigated genetic risk variants that exhibit allele-specific open chromatin (ASoC) in COVID-19 patients and identified a SNP rs6800484-C, which is associated with lower expression of CCR2 and may contribute to higher viral loads and higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Altogether, our study highlights the diverse genetic and epigenetic regulators that contribute to COVID-19."

Here, we applied a postmortem bedside surgical procedure for the rapid procurement of tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid samples from deceased COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta, Omicron BA.1, or Omicron BA.2 variants. Confocal imaging of sections stained with fluorescence RNAscope and immunohistochemistry afforded the light-microscopic visualization of extracellular SARS-CoV-2 virions in tissues. We failed to find evidence for viral invasion of the parenchyma of the olfactory bulb and the frontal lobe of the brain. Instead, we identified anatomical barriers at vulnerable interfaces, exemplified by perineurial olfactory nerve fibroblasts enwrapping olfactory axon fascicles in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa."

        "abstract": "McArdle disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the PYGM gene. This gene encodes for the skeletal muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (myophosphorylase), the first enzyme in glycogenolysis. Patients with this disorder are unable to obtain energy from their glycogen stored in skeletal muscle, prompting an exercise intolerance. Currently, there is no treatment for this disease, and the lack of suitable in vitro human models has prevented the search for therapies against it. In this article, we have established the first human iPSC-based model for McArdle disease. For the generation of this model, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with McArdle disease (harbouring the homozygous mutation c.148C>T; p.R50* in the PYGM gene) were differentiated into myogenic cells able to contract spontaneously in the presence of motor neurons and generate calcium transients, a proof of their maturity and functionality. Additionally, an isogenic skeletal muscle model of McArdle disease was created. As a proof-of-concept, we have tested in this model the rescue of PYGM expression by two different read-through compounds (PTC124 and RTC13). The developed model will be very useful as a platform for testing drugs or compounds with potential pharmacological activity."

Following a small-molecule inhibitor screen of 1,846 bioactive compounds against a Fn CRC isolate, we find that 15% of inhibitors are antineoplastic agents including fluoropyrimidines. Validation of these findings reveals that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a first-line CRC chemotherapeutic, is a potent inhibitor of Fn CRC isolates. We also identify members of the intratumoral microbiota, including Escherichia coli, that are resistant to 5-FU. Further, CRC E. coli isolates can modify 5-FU and relieve 5-FU toxicity toward otherwise-sensitive Fn and human CRC epithelial cells. Lastly, we demonstrate that ex vivo patient CRC tumor microbiota undergo community disruption after 5-FU exposure and have the potential to deplete 5-FU levels, reducing local drug efficacy. Together, these observations argue for further investigation into the role of the CRC intratumoral microbiota in patient response to chemotherapy."

Patients develop symptoms resembling those of primary mitochondrial disorders, but the underlying causes of mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we examined environmental and genetic interactions in MMUT deficiency using a combination of computational modeling and cellular models to decipher pathways interacting with MMUT. Immortalized fibroblast (hTERT BJ5ta) MMUT-KO (MUTKO) clones displayed a mild mitochondrial impairment in standard glucose-based medium, but they did not to show increased reliance on respiratory metabolism nor reduced growth or viability. Consistently, our modeling predicted MUTKO specific growth phenotypes only for lower extracellular glutamine concentrations. Indeed, two of three MMUT-deficient BJ5ta cell lines showed a reduced viability in glutamine-free medium. Further, growth on 183 different carbon and nitrogen substrates identified increased NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) metabolism of BJ5ta and HEK293 MUTKO cells compared with controls on purine- and glutamine-based substrates. With this knowledge, our modeling predicted 13 reactions interacting with MMUT that potentiate an effect on growth, primarily those of secondary oxidation of propionyl-CoA, oxidative phosphorylation and oxygen diffusion. Of these, we validated 3-hydroxyisobutytyl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) in the secondary propionyl-CoA oxidation pathway. Altogether, these results suggest compensation for the loss of MMUT function by increasing anaplerosis through glutamine or by diverting flux away from MMUT through the secondary propionyl-CoA oxidation pathway, which may have therapeutic relevance."

        "abstract": "A wide range of cardiac symptoms have been observed in COVID-19 patients, often significantly influencing the clinical outcome. While the pathophysiology of pulmonary COVID-19 manifestation has been substantially unraveled, the underlying pathomechanisms of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are largely unknown. In this multicentre study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of heart samples from 24 autopsies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them to samples of age-matched Influenza H1N1 A (n = 16), lymphocytic non-influenza myocarditis cases (n = 8), and non-inflamed heart tissue (n = 9). We employed conventional histopathology, multiplexed immunohistochemistry (MPX), microvascular corrosion casting, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray phase-contrast tomography using synchrotron radiation, and direct multiplexed measurements of gene expression, to assess morphological and molecular changes holistically. Based on histopathology, none of the COVID-19 samples fulfilled the established diagnostic criteria of viral myocarditis. However, quantification via MPX showed a significant increase in perivascular CD11b/TIE2 + -macrophages in COVID-19 over time, which was not observed in influenza or non-SARS-CoV-2 viral myocarditis patients. Ultrastructurally, a significant increase in intussusceptive angiogenesis as well as multifocal thrombi, inapparent in conventional morphological analysis, could be demonstrated. In line with this, on a molecular level, COVID-19 hearts displayed a distinct expression pattern of genes primarily coding for factors involved in angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), changes not seen in any of the other patient groups. We conclude that cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is an angiocentric macrophage-driven inflammatory process, distinct from classical anti-viral inflammatory responses, and substantially underappreciated by conventional histopathologic analysis. For the first time, we have observed intussusceptive angiogenesis in cardiac tissue, which we previously identified as the linchpin of vascular remodeling in COVID-19 pneumonia, as a pathognomic sign in affected hearts. Moreover, we identified CD11b + /TIE2 + macrophages as the drivers of intussusceptive angiogenesis and set forward a putative model for the molecular regulation of vascular alterations."

The most prominent signs of severe Neuro-COVID are blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, elevated microglia activation markers and a polyclonal B cell response targeting self-antigens and non-self-antigens. COVID-19 patients show decreased regional brain volumes associating with specific CSF parameters, however, COVID-19 patients characterized by plasma cytokine storm are presenting with a non-inflammatory CSF profile. Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome strongly associates with a distinctive set of CSF and plasma mediators.

Early clinical symptomatology focused mainly on respiratory illnesses. However, a variety of neurological manifestations in both adults and newborns are now well-documented. To experimentally determine whether SARS-CoV-2 could replicate in and affect human brain cells, we infected iPSC-derived human brain organoids. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can productively replicate and promote death of neural cells, including cortical neurons. This phenotype was accompanied by loss of excitatory synapses in neurons. Notably, we found that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral Sofosbuvir was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and rescued these neuronal alterations in infected brain organoids. Given the urgent need for readily available antivirals, these results provide a cellular basis supporting repurposed antivirals as a strategic treatment to alleviate neurocytological defects that may underlie COVID-19- related neurological symptoms."

        "abstract": "Genome wide association studies show there is a genetic component to severe COVID-19. We find evidence that the genome-wide genetic association signal with severe COVID-19 is correlated with that of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), having formally tested this using genetic correlation analysis by LD score regression. To identify the shared associated loci and gain insight into the shared genetic effects, using summary level data we performed meta-analyses, a local genetic correlation analysis and fine-mapping using stepwise regression and functional annotation. This identified multiple loci shared between the two traits, some of which exert opposing effects. The locus with most evidence of shared association is TYK2, a gene critical to the type I interferon pathway, where the local genetic correlation is negative. Another shared locus is CLEC1A, where the direction of effects is aligned, that encodes a lectin involved in cell signaling, and the anti-fungal immune response. Our analyses suggest that several loci with reciprocal effects between the two traits have a role in the defense response pathway, adding to the evidence that SLE risk alleles are protective against infection."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity-associated metabolic complications display sexual dimorphism and can be impacted by cytokines. We previously showed that interleukin-10 (IL-10) was upregulated in white adipose tissue (WAT) of obese women with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Whether this pertains to men is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of obesity and T2D on WAT IL-10 levels in men versus women. METHODS: Plasma and subcutaneous WAT biopsies were obtained from 108 metabolically well-characterized individuals. WAT IL10 expression/secretion and WAT-resident IL-10-secreting macrophage number were measured. Circulating sex hormone levels were correlated to WAT IL10 expression in 22 individuals and sex hormone effects on macrophage IL10 expression were investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Obese women with T2D showed increased IL10 expression/secretion and IL-10-secreting WAT macrophage number compared to other female groups. This difference was absent in men. Non-obese women and men with T2D showed similar IL-10 levels compared to healthy controls, indicating that T2D alone does not regulate IL-10. Although WAT IL10 expression correlated with serum estrone (E1) concentrations, recombinant E1 did not affect macrophage IL10 expression in vitro. CONCLUSION: WAT IL-10 levels are higher in women with obesity and T2D, but not in men and this effect is primarily attributed to obesity per se. This is less likely to be driven by circulating sex hormones. We propose that the WAT IL-10 might exert protective effects in obesity-associated chronic inflammation in women which could be one of the contributing factors for the decreased morbidity observed in women during obesity than men."

        "abstract": "Stem cell-derived beta cells offer an alternative to primary islets for biomedical discoveries as well as a potential surrogate for islet transplantation. The expense and challenge of obtaining and maintaining functional stem cell-derived beta cells calls for a need to develop better high-content and high-throughput culture systems. Microphysiological systems (MPS) are promising high-content in vitro platforms, but scaling for high-throughput screening and discoveries remain a challenge. Traditionally, simultaneous multiplexing of liquid handling and cell loading poses a challenge in the design of high-throughput MPS. Furthermore, although MPS for islet beta culture/testing have been developed, studies on multi-day culture of stem-cell derived beta cells in MPS have been limited. We present a scalable, multiplexed islet beta MPS device that incorporates microfluidic gradient generators to parallelize fluid handling for culture and test conditions. We demonstrated the viability and functionality of the stem cell-derived enriched beta clusters (eBCs) for a week, as assessed by the  approximately 2 fold insulin release by the clusters to glucose challenge. To show the scalable multiplexing for drug testing, we demonstrated the loss of stimulation index after long-term exposure to logarithmic concentration range of glybenclamide. The MPS cultured eBCs also confirmed a glycolytic bottleneck as inferred by insulin secretion responses to metabolites methyl succinate and glyceric acid. Thus, we present an innovative culture platform for eBCs with a balance of high-content and high-throughput characteristics."

We created precursor sequence definitions for V2-apex HCDR3-dependent bnAbs and searched for related precursors in human antibody heavy-chain ultradeep sequencing data from 14 HIV-unexposed donors. We found potential precursors in a majority of donors for only two long-HCDR3 V2-apex bnAbs, PCT64 and PG9, identifying these bnAbs as priority vaccine targets. We then engineered ApexGT Env trimers that bound inferred germlines for PCT64 and PG9 and had higher affinities for bnAbs, determined cryo-EM structures of ApexGT trimers complexed with inferred-germline and bnAb forms of PCT64 and PG9, and developed an mRNA-encoded cell-surface ApexGT trimer. These methods and immunogens have promise to assist HIV vaccine development."

In a screen of biologically active small molecules for regulators of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induction, we identify several compounds with the ability to induce training effects on human macrophages. Rutaecarpine shows acute and long-term modulation, enhancing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and relieving LPS tolerance in human macrophages. Rutaecarpine inhibits beta-glucan-induced H3K4Me3 marks at the promoters of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potential of this molecule to modulate chromosomal topology. Syk kinase inhibitor (SYKi IV), another screen hit, promotes an enhanced response to LPS similar to that previously reported for beta-glucan-induced training. Macrophages trained with SYKi IV show a high degree of resistance to influenza A, multiple variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and OC43 coronavirus infection, highlighting a potential application of this molecule and other SYKis as prophylactic treatments for viral susceptibility."

Affinity selection of SARS-CoV-2 particles was carried out using injection molded microfluidic chips, which allow for high-scale production to accommodate large-scale screening. The microfluidic contained a surface-bound aptamer directed against the virus's S protein RBD to affinity select SARS-CoV-2 VPs. Following selection (~94% recovery), the VPs were released from the chip's surface using a blue light light-emitting diode (89% efficiency). Selected SARS-CoV-2 VP enumeration was carried out using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The VP selection assay successfully identified healthy donors (clinical specificity = 100%) and 19 of 20 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (95% sensitivity). In 15 patients with COVID-19, the presence of active SARS-CoV-2 VPs was found. The chip can be reprogrammed for any VP or exosomes by simply changing the affinity agent."

Blocking FSH action prevents bone loss, fat gain, and neurodegeneration in mice. We recently developed a first-in-class, humanized, epitope-specific FSH-blocking antibody, MS-Hu6, with a K(D) of 7.52 nM. Using a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant platform, we now report the efficacy of MS-Hu6 in preventing and treating osteoporosis in mice and parameters of acute safety in monkeys. Biodistribution studies using (89)Zr-labeled, biotinylated or unconjugated MS-Hu6 in mice and monkeys showed localization to bone and bone marrow. The MS-Hu6 displayed a beta phase t((1/2)) of 7.5 days (180 hr) in humanized Tg32 mice. We tested 217 variations of excipients using the protein thermal shift assay to generate a final formulation that rendered MS-Hu6 stable in solution upon freeze-thaw and at different temperatures, with minimal aggregation, and without self-, cross-, or hydrophobic interactions or appreciable binding to relevant human antigens. The MS-Hu6 showed the same level of \"humanness\" as human IgG1 in silico and was non-immunogenic in ELISpot assays for IL-2 and IFN-gamma in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. We conclude that MS-Hu6 is efficacious, durable, and manufacturable, and is therefore poised for future human testing."

To address this issue, this work will offer DHDIP, an interpretable hypertension and hyperlipidemia prediction model based on EMR data. METHODS: First, we will select massive high-dimensional, unstructured EMR data as a unified modeling data source, and propose a pre-processing algorithm for EMR data to solve the problem that EMR data cannot be directly processed by machine learning algorithms. Second, a variety of mainstream models such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and RandomForest are selected for modeling, and the best adaptation algorithms are identified by performance comparison. Finally, the SHAP framework was introduced into the DHDIP model, thus identifying the main factors contributing to hypertension and hyperlipidemia, effectively enhancing the interpretability of the model. RESULTS: The DHDIP model's MSE value is 0.0285, and its LOSS value is 0.0054, both of which are better than previous studies. CONCLUSION: The model balances performance and interpretability. Multi-objective learning allows for a more thorough analysis and prediction of the condition, which not only lowers the cost of disease prediction but also aids physicians in clinical diagnosis.

Placental malaria (PM) resulted from Plasmodium falciparum infections causes up to 200 thousand newborn deaths annually, mainly due to low birth weight, as well as 10 thousand mother deaths. In this work, a placenta-on-a-chip model is developed to mimic the nutrient exchange between the fetus and mother under the influence of PM. In this model, trophoblasts cells (facing infected or uninfected blood simulating maternal blood and termed \"trophoblast side\") and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (facing uninfected blood simulating fetal blood and termed \"endothelial\" side) are cultured on the opposite sides of an extracellular matrix gel in a compartmental microfluidic system, forming a physiological barrier between the co-flow tubular structure to mimic a simplified maternal-fetal interface in placental villi. The influences of infected erythrocytes (IEs) sequestration through cytoadhesion to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells, a critical feature of PM, on glucose transfer efficiency across the placental barrier was studied. To create glucose gradients across the barrier, uninfected erythrocyte or IE suspension with a higher glucose concentration was introduced into the \"trophoblast side\" and a culture medium with lower glucose concentration was introduced into the \"endothelial side\". The glucose levels in the endothelial channel in response to CSA-adherent erythrocytes infected with CS2 line of parasites in trophoblast channel under flow conditions was monitored. Uninfected erythrocytes served as a negative control. The results demonstrated that CSA-binding IEs added resistance to the simulated placental barrier for glucose perfusion and decreased the glucose transfer across this barrier. The results of this study can be used for better understanding of PM pathology and development of models useful in studying potential treatment of PM."

The study uses metabolic syndrome (MetS) as the entry point to analyze and evaluate the application value of model interpretability methods in dealing with difficult interpretation of predictive models. METHODS: The study collects data from a chain of health examination institution in Urumqi from 2017 ~ 2019, and performs 39,134 remaining data after preprocessing such as deletion and filling. RFE is used for feature selection to reduce redundancy; MetS risk prediction models (logistic, random forest, XGBoost) are built based on a feature subset, and accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and AUROC value are used to evaluate the model classification performance; post-hoc model-agnostic interpretation methods (variable importance, LIME) are used to interpret the results of the predictive model. RESULTS: Eighteen physical examination indicators are screened out by RFE, which can effectively solve the problem of physical examination data redundancy. Random forest and XGBoost models have higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and AUROC values compared with logistic regression. XGBoost models have higher sensitivity, Youden index, and AUROC values compared with random forest. The study uses variable importance, LIME and PDP for global and local interpretation of the optimal MetS risk prediction model (XGBoost), and different interpretation methods have different insights into the interpretation of model results, which are more flexible in model selection and can visualize the process and reasons for the model to make decisions. The interpretable risk prediction model in this study can help to identify risk factors associated with MetS, and the results showed that in addition to the traditional risk factors such as overweight and obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, MetS was also associated with other factors, including age, creatinine, uric acid, and alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSION: The model interpretability methods are applied to the black box model, which can not only realize the flexibility of model application, but also make up for the uninterpretable defects of the model. Model interpretability methods can be used as a novel means of identifying variables that are more likely to be good predictors."

We aimed to identify lineages driving the increase of serotype 24F in France and place these findings into a global context. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a collection of serotype 24F pneumococci from asymptomatic colonisation (n=229) and invasive disease (n=190) isolates among individuals younger than 18 years in France, from 2003 to 2018. To provide a global context, we included an additional collection of 24F isolates in the Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) project database for analysis. A Global Pneumococcal Sequence Cluster (GPSC) and a clonal complex (CC) were assigned to each genome. Phylogenetic, evolutionary, and spatiotemporal analysis were conducted using the same 24F collection and supplemented with a global collection of genomes belonging to the lineage of interest from the GPS project database (n=25 590). FINDINGS: Serotype 24F was identified in numerous countries mainly due to the clonal spread of three lineages: GPSC10 (CC230), GPSC16 (CC156), and GPSC206 (CC7701). GPSC10 was the only multidrug-resistant lineage. GPSC10 drove the increase in 24F in France and had high invasive disease potential. The international dataset of GPSC10 (n=888) revealed that this lineage expressed 16 other serotypes, with only six included in 13-valent PCV (PCV13). All serotype 24F isolates were clustered in a single clade within the GPSC10 phylogeny and long-range transmissions were detected from Europe to other continents. Spatiotemporal analysis showed GPSC10-24F took 3-5 years to spread across France and a rapid change of serotype composition from PCV13 serotype 19A to 24F during the introduction of PCV13 was observed in neighbouring country Spain. INTERPRETATION: Our work reveals that GPSC10 alone is a challenge for serotype-based vaccine strategy. More systematic investigation to identify lineages like GPSC10 will better inform and improve next-generation preventive strategies against pneumococcal diseases.

Here, we addressed whether pathological skin conditions can facilitate viral entry via the skin surface and used ex vivo infection studies to explore viral invasion in atopic dermatitis (AD) skin characterized by disturbed barrier functions. Our focus was on the visualization of the onset of infection in single cells to determine the primary entry portals in the epidermis. After ex vivo infection of lesional AD skin, we observed infected cells in suprabasal layers indicating successful invasion in the epidermis via the skin surface which was never detected in control skin where only sample edges allowed viral access. The redistribution of filaggrin, loricrin, and tight-junction components in the lesional skin samples suggested multiple defective mechanical barriers. To dissect the parameters that contribute to HSV-1 invasion, we induced an AD-like phenotype by adding the Th2 cytokines interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 to healthy human skin samples. Strikingly, we detected infected cells in the epidermis, implying that the IL-4/IL-13-driven inflammation is sufficient to induce modifications allowing HSV-1 to penetrate the skin surface. In summary, not only did lesional AD skin facilitate HSV-1 penetration but IL-4/IL-13 responses alone allowed virus invasion. Our results suggest that the defective epidermal barriers of AD skin and the inflammation-induced altered barriers in healthy skin can make receptors accessible for HSV-1. IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can target skin to establish primary infection in the epithelium. While the human skin provides effective barriers against viral invasion under healthy conditions, a prominent example of successful invasion is the disseminated HSV-1 infection in the skin of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. AD is characterized by impaired epidermal barrier functions, chronic inflammation, and dysbiosis of skin microbiota. We addressed the initial invasion process of HSV-1 in atopic dermatitis skin to understand whether the physical barrier functions are sufficiently disturbed to allow the virus to invade skin and reach its receptors on skin cells. Our results demonstrate that HSV-1 can indeed penetrate and initiate infection in atopic dermatitis skin. Since treatment of skin with IL-4 and IL-13 already resulted in successful invasion, we assume that inflammation-induced barrier defects play an important role for the facilitated access of HSV-1 to its target cells."

        "abstract": "The intestinal mucus lines the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. This mucus is a dynamic semipermeable barrier and one of the first-line defense mechanisms against the outside environment, protecting the body against chemical, mechanical, or biological external insults. At the same time, the intestinal mucus accommodates the resident microbiota, providing nutrients and attachment sites, and therefore playing an essential role in the host-pathogen interactions and gut homeostasis. Underneath this mucus layer, the intestinal epithelium is organized into finger-like protrusions called villi and invaginations called crypts. This characteristic 3D architecture is known to influence the epithelial cell differentiation and function. However, when modelling in vitro the intestinal host-pathogen interactions, these two essential features, the intestinal mucus and the 3D topography are often not represented, thus limiting the relevance of the models. Here we present an in vitro model that mimics the small intestinal mucosa and its interactions with intestinal pathogens in a relevant manner, containing the secreted mucus layer and the epithelial barrier in a 3D villus-like hydrogel scaffold. This 3D architecture significantly enhanced the secretion of mucus. In infection with the pathogenic adherent invasive E. coli strain LF82, characteristic of Crohn's disease, we observed that this secreted mucus promoted the adhesion of the pathogen and at the same time had a protective effect upon its invasion. This pathogenic strain was able to survive inside the epithelial cells and trigger an inflammatory response that was milder when a thick mucus layer was present. Thus, we demonstrated that our model faithfully mimics the key features of the intestinal mucosa necessary to study the interactions with intestinal pathogens."

        "abstract": "Intestinal cell dysfunctions involved in obesity and associated diabetes could be correlated with impaired intestinal cell development. To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions have been poorly investigated because of the lack of a good model for studying obesity. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lipotoxicity on intestinal cell differentiation in small intestinal organoid platforms, which are used to analyze the regulation of cell differentiation. Mouse intestinal organoids were grown in the presence/absence of high palmitate concentrations (0.5 mM) for 48 h to simulate lipotoxicity. Palmitate treatment altered the expression of markers involved in the differentiation of enterocytes and goblet cells in the early (Hes1) and late (Muc2) phases of their development, respectively, and it modified enterocytes and goblet cell numbers. Furthermore, the expression of enteroendocrine cell progenitors (Ngn3) and I cells (CCK) markers was also impaired, as well as CCK-positive cell numbers and CCK secretion. Our data indicate, for the first time, that lipotoxicity simultaneously influences the differentiation of specific intestinal cell types in the gut: enterocytes, goblet cells and CCK cells. Through this study, we identified novel targets associated with molecular mechanisms affected by lipotoxicity that could be important for obesity and diabetes therapy."

TR is considered an attractive target for the development of new trypanocidal agents as it is essential for parasite survival but has no close homolog in humans. However, the high efficiency and turnover of TR challenging targets since only potent inhibitors, with nanomolar IC50, can significantly affect parasite redox state and viability. To aid the design of effective compounds targeting TR, we performed a fragment-based crystal screening at the Diamond Light Source XChem facility using a library optimized for follow-up synthesis steps. The experiment, allowing for testing over 300 compounds, resulted in the identification of 12 new ligands binding five different sites. Interestingly, the screening revealed the existence of an allosteric pocket close to the NADPH binding site, named the \"doorstop pocket\" since ligands binding at this site interfere with TR activity by hampering the \"opening movement\" needed to allow cofactor binding. The second remarkable site, known as the Z-site, identified by the screening, is located within the large trypanothione cavity but corresponds to a region not yet exploited for inhibition. The fragments binding to this site are close to each other and have some remarkable features making them ideal for follow-up optimization as a piperazine moiety in three out of five fragments."

A key challenge is to suppress viral escape, which is more effectively achieved with a combination of bNAbs. Here, we propose a computational approach to predict the efficacy of a bNAb therapy based on the population genetics of HIV escape, which we parametrize using high-throughput HIV sequence data from bNAb-naive patients. By quantifying the mutational target size and the fitness cost of HIV-1 escape from bNAbs, we predict the distribution of rebound times in three clinical trials. We show that a cocktail of three bNAbs is necessary to effectively suppress viral escape, and predict the optimal composition of such bNAb cocktail. Our results offer a rational therapy design for HIV, and show how genetic data can be used to predict treatment outcomes and design new approaches to pathogenic control."

These new subvariants carrying further mutations in their spike proteins raise concerns that they may further evade neutralizing antibodies, thereby further compromising the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic monoclonals. We now report findings from a systematic antigenic analysis of these surging Omicron subvariants. BA.2.12.1 is only modestly (1.8-fold) more resistant to sera from vaccinated and boosted individuals than BA.2. However, BA.4/5 is substantially (4.2-fold) more resistant and thus more likely to lead to vaccine breakthrough infections. Mutation at spike residue L452 found in both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 facilitates escape from some antibodies directed to the so-called class 2 and 3 regions of the receptor-binding domain(3). The F486V mutation found in BA.4/5 facilitates escape from certain class 1 and 2 antibodies but compromises the spike affinity for the viral receptor. The R493Q reversion mutation, however, restores receptor affinity and consequently the fitness of BA.4/5. Among therapeutic antibodies authorized for clinical use, only bebtelovimab retains full potency against both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5. The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, successively yielding subvariants that are not only more transmissible but also more evasive to antibodies."

In this study, we investigated the effect of BNT162b2 on the human liver cell line Huh7 in vitro. Huh7 cells were exposed to BNT162b2, and quantitative PCR was performed on RNA extracted from the cells. We detected high levels of BNT162b2 in Huh7 cells and changes in gene expression of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1), which is an endogenous reverse transcriptase. Immunohistochemistry using antibody binding to LINE-1 open reading frame-1 RNA-binding protein (ORFp1) on Huh7 cells treated with BNT162b2 indicated increased nucleus distribution of LINE-1. PCR on genomic DNA of Huh7 cells exposed to BNT162b2 amplified the DNA sequence unique to BNT162b2. Our results indicate a fast up-take of BNT162b2 into human liver cell line Huh7, leading to changes in LINE-1 expression and distribution. We also show that BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA in as fast as 6 h upon BNT162b2 exposure."

Here, we investigate the interplay between C. albicans, L. rhamnosus, and intestinal epithelial cells by integrating transcriptional and metabolic profiling, and reverse genetics. Untargeted metabolomics and in silico modelling indicate that intestinal epithelial cells foster bacterial growth metabolically, leading to bacterial production of antivirulence compounds. In addition, bacterial growth modifies the metabolic environment, including removal of C. albicans' favoured nutrient sources. This is accompanied by transcriptional and metabolic changes in C. albicans, including altered expression of virulence-related genes. Our results indicate that intestinal colonization with bacteria can antagonize C. albicans by reshaping the metabolic environment, forcing metabolic adaptations that reduce fungal pathogenicity."

Here we observed that an mRNA vaccine booster in individuals vaccinated with two doses of inactivated vaccine significantly increased the plasma level of specific antibodies that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the spike (S) ectodomain (S1 + S2) of both the G614 and the Omicron variants, compared to two doses of homologous inactivated vaccine. The level of RBD- and S-specific IgG antibodies and virus neutralization titers against variants of concern in the heterologous vaccination group were similar to that in individuals receiving three doses of homologous mRNA-vaccine or a boost of mRNA vaccine after infection, but markedly higher than that in individuals receiving three doses of a homologous inactivated vaccine. This heterologous vaccination regime furthermore significantly enhanced the RBD-specific memory B cell response and S1-specific T cell response, compared to two or three doses of homologous inactivated vaccine. Our study demonstrates that mRNA vaccine booster in individuals vaccinated with inactivated vaccines can be highly beneficial, as it markedly increases the humoral and cellular immune responses against the virus, including the Omicron variant."

In this era of \"diabesity\", white adipose tissue (WAT) has become a target of high interest for therapeutic strategies. To gain insights into mechanisms of adipose (patho-)physiology, researchers traditionally relied on animal models. Leveraging Organ-on-Chip technology, a microphysiological in vitro model of human WAT is introduced: a tailored microfluidic platform featuring vasculature-like perfusion that integrates 3D tissues comprising all major WAT-associated cellular components (mature adipocytes, organotypic endothelial barriers, stromovascular cells including adipose tissue macrophages) in an autologous manner and recapitulates pivotal WAT functions, such as energy storage and mobilization as well as endocrine and immunomodulatory activities. A precisely controllable bottom-up approach enables the generation of a multitude of replicates per donor circumventing inter-donor variability issues and paving the way for personalized medicine. Moreover, it allows to adjust the model's degree of complexity via a flexible mix-and-match approach. This WAT-on-Chip system constitutes the first human-based, autologous, and immunocompetent in vitro adipose tissue model that recapitulates almost full tissue heterogeneity and can become a powerful tool for human-relevant research in the field of metabolism and its associated diseases as well as for compound testing and personalized- and precision medicine applications."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major public health problem affecting millions of Americans and is considered one of the most potent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Assessing future disease burden is important for informing policy-decision making for population health and healthcare. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a computer model of a cohort of children born in Los Angeles County to study the life course incidence and trends of obesity and its effect on type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We built the Virtual Los Angeles cohort-ViLA, an agent-based model calibrated to the population of Los Angeles County. In particular, we developed the ViLA-Obesity model, a simulation suite within our ViLA platform that integrated trends in the causes and consequences of obesity, focusing on diabetes as a key obesity consequence during the life course. Each agent within the model exhibited obesity- and diabetes-related healthy and unhealthy behaviors such as sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, physical activity, fast-food consumption, fresh fruits, and vegetable consumption. In addition, agents could gain or lose weight and develop type 2 diabetes mellitus with a certain probability dependent on the agent's socio-demographics, past behaviors and past weight or type 2 diabetes status. We simulated 98,230 inhabitants from birth to age 65 years, living in 235 neighborhoods. RESULTS: The age-specific incidence of obesity generally increased from 10 to 30% across the life span with two notable peaks at age 6-12 and 30-39 years, while that of type 2 diabetes mellitus generally increased from <2% at age 18-24 to reach a peak of 25% at age 40-49. The 16-year risks of obesity were 32.1% (95% CI: 31.8%, 32.4%) for children aged 2-17 and 81% (95% CI: 80.8%, 81.3%) for adults aged 18-65. The 48-year risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 53.4% (95% CI: 53.1%, 53.7%) for adults aged 18-65. CONCLUSION: This ViLA-Obesity model provides an insight into the future burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Los Angeles County, one of the most diverse places in the United States. It serves as a platform for conducting experiments for informing evidence-based policy-making."

To date, no effective therapy is available for C. auris infections. Thus, characterization of therapeutic targets and designing effective vaccine candidates using subtractive proteomics and immune-informatics approaches is useful tool in controlling the emerging infections associated with SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, subtractive proteomics-assisted annotation of the vaccine targets was performed, which revealed seven vaccine targets. An immunoinformatic-driven approach was then employed to map protein-specific and proteome-wide immunogenic peptides (CTL, B cell, and HTL) for the design of multi-epitope vaccine candidates (MEVCs). The results demonstrated that the vaccine candidates possess strong antigenic features (>0.4 threshold score) and are classified as non-allergenic. Validation of the designed MEVCs through molecular docking, in-silico cloning, and immune simulation further demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccines by producing immune factor titers (ranging from 2500 to 16000 au/mL) i.e., IgM, IgG, IL-6, and Interferon-alpha. In conclusion, the current study provides a strong impetus in designing anti-fungal strategies against Candida auris."

        "abstract": "Bloodstream infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae induce strong inflammatory and procoagulant cellular responses and affect the endothelial barrier of the vascular system. Bacterial virulence determinants, such as the cytotoxic pore-forming pneumolysin, increase the endothelial barrier permeability by inducing cell apoptosis and cell damage. As life-threatening consequences, disseminated intravascular coagulation followed by consumption coagulopathy and low blood pressure is described. With the aim to decipher the role of pneumolysin in endothelial damage and leakage of the vascular barrier in more detail, we established a chamber-separation cell migration assay (CSMA) used to illustrate endothelial wound healing upon bacterial infections. We used chambered inlets for cell cultivation, which, after removal, provide a cell-free area of 500 mum in diameter as a defined gap in primary endothelial cell layers. During the process of wound healing, the size of the cell-free area is decreasing due to cell migration and proliferation, which we quantitatively determined by microscopic live cell monitoring. In addition, differential immunofluorescence staining combined with confocal microscopy was used to morphologically characterize the effect of bacterial attachment on cell migration and the velocity of gap closure. In all assays, the presence of wild-type pneumococci significantly inhibited endothelial gap closure. Remarkably, even in the presence of pneumolysin-deficient pneumococci, cell migration was significantly retarded. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of pneumococci on the proportion of cell proliferation versus cell migration within the process of endothelial gap closure was assessed by implementation of a fluorescence-conjugated nucleoside analogon. We further combined the endothelial CSMA with a microfluidic pump system, which for the first time enabled the microscopic visualization and monitoring of endothelial gap closure in the presence of circulating bacteria at defined vascular shear stress values for up to 48 h. In accordance with our CSMA results under static conditions, the gap remained cell free in the presence of circulating pneumococci in flow. Hence, our combined endothelial cultivation technique represents a complex in vitro system, which mimics the vascular physiology as close as possible by providing essential parameters of the blood flow to gain new insights into the effect of pneumococcal infection on endothelial barrier integrity in flow."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex condition that appears as a cluster of metabolic abnormalities, and is closely associated with the prevalence of various diseases. Early prediction of the risk of MetS in the middle-aged population provides greater benefits for cardiovascular disease-related health outcomes. This study aimed to apply the latest machine learning techniques to find the optimal MetS prediction model for the middle-aged Korean population. METHODS: We retrieved 20 data types from the Korean Medicine Daejeon Citizen Cohort, a cohort study on a community-based population of adults aged 30-55 years. The data included sex, age, anthropometric data, lifestyle-related data, and blood indicators of 1991 individuals. Participants satisfying two (pre-MetS) or >/= 3 (MetS) of the five NECP-ATP III criteria were included in the MetS group. MetS prediction used nine machine learning models based on the following algorithms: Decision tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron, and 1D convolutional neural network. All analyses were performed by sequentially inputting the features in three steps according to their characteristics. The models' performances were compared after applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to resolve data imbalance. RESULTS: MetS was detected in 33.85% of the subjects. Among the MetS prediction models, the tree-based random forest and XGBoost models showed the best performance, which improved with the number of features used. As a measure of the models' performance, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) increased by up to 0.091 when the SMOTE was applied, with XGBoost showing the highest AUC of 0.851. Body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were identified as the most important features in the MetS prediction models for this population. CONCLUSIONS: Tree-based machine learning models were useful in identifying MetS with high accuracy in middle-aged Koreans. Early diagnosis of MetS is important and requires a multidimensional approach that includes self-administered questionnaire, anthropometric, and biochemical measurements."

        "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) relies on host molecular machinery for replication. Systematic attempts to genetically or biochemically define these host factors have yielded hundreds of candidates, but few have been functionally validated in primary cells. Here, we target 426 genes previously implicated in the HIV lifecycle through protein interaction studies for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock-out in primary human CD4+ T cells in order to systematically assess their functional roles in HIV replication. We achieve efficient knockout (>50% of alleles) in 364 of the targeted genes and identify 86 candidate host factors that alter HIV infection. 47 of these factors validate by multiplex gene editing in independent donors, including 23 factors with restrictive activity. Both gene editing efficiencies and HIV-1 phenotypes are highly concordant among independent donors. Importantly, over half of these factors have not been previously described to play a functional role in HIV replication, providing numerous novel avenues for understanding HIV biology. These data further suggest that host-pathogen protein-protein interaction datasets offer an enriched source of candidates for functional host factor discovery and provide an improved understanding of the mechanics of HIV replication in primary T cells."

        "abstract": "Several studies have pointed to retinal involvement in COVID-19, yet many questions remain regarding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in retinal cells and its effects on the retina. Here, we have used human pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal organoids to study retinal infection by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in retinal organoids, as it is shown to infect different retinal lineages, such as retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids also induces the expression of several inflammatory genes, such as interleukin 33, a gene associated with acute COVID-19 and retinal degeneration. Finally, we show that the use of antibodies to block ACE2 significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infects retinal cells in an ACE2-dependent manner. These results suggest a retinal involvement in COVID-19 and emphasize the need to monitor retinal pathologies as potential sequelae of \"long COVID.\""

A human model of ectopic LF formation will provide a tool to understand LF development and an alternative to non-human primates for preclinical evaluation of vaccines. Here, it is shown that primary human blood B- and T-lymphocytes autonomously assemble into ectopic LFs when cultured in a 3D extracellular matrix gel within one channel of a two-channel organ-on-a-chip microfluidic device. Superfusion via a parallel channel separated by a microporous membrane is required for LF formation and prevents lymphocyte autoactivation. These germinal center-like LFs contain B cells expressing Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase and exhibit plasma cell differentiation upon activation. To explore their utility for seasonal vaccine testing, autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells are integrated into LF Chips. The human LF chips demonstrate improved antibody responses to split virion influenza vaccination compared to 2D cultures, which are enhanced by a squalene-in-water emulsion adjuvant, and this is accompanied by increases in LF size and number. When inoculated with commercial influenza vaccine, plasma cell formation and production of anti-hemagglutinin IgG are observed, as well as secretion of cytokines similar to vaccinated humans over clinically relevant timescales."

Although current differentiation methods produce glucose-responsive beta cells, they can also yield populations of undesired endocrine progenitors and other proliferating cell types that might interfere with long-term islet function and safety of transplanted cells. Here, we describe the generation of an array of monoclonal antibodies against cell surface markers that selectively label stem cell-derived islet cells. A high-throughput screen identified promising candidates, including three clones that mark a high proportion of endocrine cells in differentiated cultures. A scalable magnetic sorting method was developed to enrich for human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived islet cells using these three antibodies, leading to the formation of islet-like clusters with improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduced growth upon transplantation. This strategy should facilitate large-scale production of functional islet clusters from stem cells for disease modeling and cell replacement therapy."

        "abstract": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a frequent neurological complication in immunosuppressed patients. PML is caused by the JC virus (JCV), a neurotropic DNA polyomavirus that infects oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, causing inflammation and demyelination which lead to neurological dysfunction. The pathogenesis of PML is poorly understood due to the lack of in vitro or animal models to study mechanisms of disease as the virus most efficiently infects only human cells. We developed a human-derived brain organotypic system (also called brain organoid) to model JCV infection. The model was developed by using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and culturing them in 3D to generate an organotypic model containing neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes which recapitulates aspects of the environment of the human brain. We infected the brain organoids with the JCV MAD4 strain or cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with PML. The organoids were assessed for evidence of infection by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-exposure. JCV infection in both JCV MAD4 strain and PML CSF-exposed brain organoids was confirmed by immunocytochemical studies demonstrating viral antigens and electron microscopy showing virion particles in the nuclear compartment of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. No evidence of neuronal infection was visualized. Infection was also demonstrated by JCV qPCR in the virus-exposed organoids and their media. In conclusion, the brain organoid model of JCV infection establishes a human model suitable for studying the mechanisms of JCV infection and pathogenesis of PML and may facilitate the exploration of therapeutic approaches."

New methods are needed to study the human immune response to HCV since in vivo animal models are limited and in vitro cancer cell models often show dysregulated immune and proliferative responses. Here, we developed a CD8(+) T cell and adult stem cell liver organoid system using a microfluidic chip to coculture 3D human liver organoids embedded in extracellular matrix with HLA-matched primary human T cells in suspension. We then employed automated phase contrast and immunofluorescence imaging to monitor T cell invasion and morphological changes in the liver organoids. This microfluidic coculture system supports targeted killing of liver organoids when pulsed with a peptide specific for HCV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) (KLVALGINAV) in the presence of patient-derived CD8(+) T cells specific for KLVALGINAV. This demonstrates the novel potential of the coculture system to molecularly study adaptive immune responses to HCV in an in vitro setting using primary human cells."

Lack of in-vitro models recapitulating cervical epithelium has been a bottleneck to study coinfections. Using patient-derived ectocervical organoids, we systematically modeled individual and coinfection dynamics of Human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E6E7 and Chlamydia, associated with carcinogenesis. The ectocervical stem cells were genetically manipulated to introduce E6E7 oncogenes to mimic HPV16 integration. Organoids from these stem cells develop the characteristics of precancerous lesions while retaining the self-renewal capacity and organize into mature stratified epithelium similar to healthy organoids. HPV16 E6E7 interferes with Chlamydia development and induces persistence. Unique transcriptional and post-translational responses induced by Chlamydia and HPV lead to distinct reprogramming of host cell processes. Strikingly, Chlamydia impedes HPV-induced mechanisms that maintain cellular and genome integrity, including mismatch repair in the stem cells. Together, our study employing organoids demonstrates the hazard of multiple infections and the unique cellular microenvironment they create, potentially contributing to neoplastic progression."

Adaptive Natural Killer (NK) cells undergo a persistent reconfiguration in response to HCMV reactivation however, the exact role of adaptive NK cells in HCMV surveillance is currently unknown. We studied the relationship between HCMV reactivation and adaptive NK cells in 70 patients monitored weekly until day +100 after HSCT. Absolute cell counts of adaptive NK cells increased significantly after resolution of HCMV-reactivation compared to patients without reactivation. Patients with HCMV-reactivation had an early reconstitution of adaptive NK cells (\"Responders\") and had mainly a single reactivation (75% Responders vs 48% Non-Responders). Adaptive NK cells eliminated HCMV-infected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) in vitro and recruited T cells in an in vitro transwell migration assay. An extensive cytokine/chemokine panel demonstrated strongly increased secretion of CXCL10/IP-10, IFN-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-5, IL-7 and CCL4. Thus, adaptive NK cells may control viral spread and T cell expansion and survival during HCMV-reactivation. Taken together, we have demonstrated the potential of adaptive NK cells in the control of HCMV reactivation both by direct cytotoxicity and by recruitment of other immune cells."

        "abstract": "There is an unmet need for preclinical models to understand the pathogenesis of human respiratory viruses and predict responsiveness to immunotherapies. Airway organoids can serve as an ex vivo human airway model to study respiratory viral pathogenesis; however, they rely on invasive techniques to obtain patient samples. Here, we report a noninvasive technique to generate human nose organoids (HNOs) as an alternative to biopsy-derived organoids. We made air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures from HNOs and assessed infection with two major human respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infected HNO-ALI cultures recapitulate aspects of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral shedding, ciliary damage, innate immune responses, and mucus hypersecretion. Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the HNO-ALI respiratory virus model system to test the efficacy of palivizumab to prevent RSV infection. Palivizumab was administered in the basolateral compartment (circulation), while viral infection occurred in the apical ciliated cells (airways), simulating the events in infants. In our model, palivizumab effectively prevented RSV infection in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, the HNO-ALI model can serve as an alternative to lung organoids to study respiratory viruses and test therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Preclinical models that recapitulate aspects of human airway disease are essential for the advancement of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we report a versatile airway organoid model, the human nose organoid (HNO), that recapitulates the complex interactions between the host and virus. HNOs are obtained using noninvasive procedures and show divergent responses to SARS-CoV-2 and RSV infection. SARS-CoV-2 induces severe damage to cilia and the epithelium, no interferon-lambda response, and minimal mucus secretion. In striking contrast, RSV induces hypersecretion of mucus and a profound interferon-lambda response with ciliary damage. We also demonstrated the usefulness of our ex vivo HNO model of RSV infection to test the efficacy of palivizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk infants. Our study reports a breakthrough in both the development of a novel nose organoid model and in our understanding of the host cellular response to RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection."

        "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is one of the biggest health challenges of recent decades. Among the causes of mortality triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the development of an inflammatory \"cytokine storm\" (CS) plays a determinant role. Here, we used transcriptomic data from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients undergoing a CS to obtain gene-signatures associated to this pathology. Using these signatures, we interrogated the Connectivity Map (CMap) dataset that contains the effects of over 5000 small molecules on the transcriptome of human cell lines, and looked for molecules which effects on transcription mimic or oppose those of the CS. As expected, molecules that potentiate immune responses such as PKC activators are predicted to worsen the CS. In addition, we identified the negative regulation of female hormones among pathways potentially aggravating the CS, which helps to understand the gender-related differences in COVID-19 mortality. Regarding drugs potentially counteracting the CS, we identified glucocorticoids as a top hit, which validates our approach as this is the primary treatment for this pathology. Interestingly, our analysis also reveals a potential effect of MEK inhibitors in reverting the COVID-19 CS, which is supported by in vitro data that confirms the anti-inflammatory properties of these compounds."

Here, we report that Gua, and not the other standard nucleosides, inhibits HCV replication in human hepatoma cells. Gua did not directly inhibit the in vitro polymerase activity of NS5B, but it modified the intracellular levels of nucleoside di- and tri-phosphates (NDPs and NTPs), leading to deficient HCV RNA replication and reduction of infectious progeny virus production. Changes in the concentrations of NTPs or NDPs modified NS5B RNA polymerase activity in vitro, in particular de novo RNA synthesis and template switching. Furthermore, the Gua-mediated changes were associated with a significant increase in the number of indels in viral RNA, which may account for the reduction of the specific infectivity of the viral progeny, suggesting the presence of defective genomes. Thus, a proper NTP:NDP balance appears to be critical to ensure HCV polymerase fidelity and minimal production of defective genomes."

Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in patients' brain tissues, its entry routes and resulting consequences are not well understood. Here, we show a pronounced upregulation of interferon signaling pathways of the neurovascular unit in fatal COVID-19. By investigating the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived brain capillary endothelial-like cells (BCECs) to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that BCECs were infected and recapitulated transcriptional changes detected in vivo. While BCECs were not compromised in their paracellular tightness, we found SARS-CoV-2 in the basolateral compartment in transwell assays after apical infection, suggesting active replication and transcellular transport of virus across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Moreover, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into BCECs could be reduced by anti-spike-, anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-, and anti-neuropilin-1 (NRP1)-specific antibodies or the transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) inhibitor nafamostat. Together, our data provide strong support for SARS-CoV-2 brain entry across the BBB resulting in increased interferon signaling."

Infection of the nose is considered the dominant initial site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and models that replicate this entry portal offer the greatest potential for examining and demonstrating the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to prevent or manage this highly communicable disease. Here, we test an air-liquid-interface (ALI) differentiated human nasal epithelium (HNE) culture system as a model of authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Progenitor cells (basal cells) were isolated from nasal turbinate brushings, expanded under conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) culture conditions and differentiated at ALI. Differentiated cells were inoculated with different SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates. Infectious virus release into apical washes was determined by TCID(50), while infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. We demonstrate robust, reproducible SARS-CoV-2 infection of ALI-HNE established from different donors. Viral entry and release occurred from the apical surface, and infection was primarily observed in ciliated cells. In contrast to the ancestral clinical isolate, the Delta variant caused considerable cell damage. Successful establishment of ALI-HNE is donor dependent. ALI-HNE recapitulate key features of human SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nose and can serve as a pre-clinical model without the need for invasive collection of human respiratory tissue samples."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance is a common etiology of metabolic syndrome, but receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows a weak association in Koreans. Using a machine learning (ML) approach, we aimed to generate the best model for predicting insulin resistance in Korean adults aged > 40 of the Ansan/Ansung cohort using a machine learning (ML) approach. METHODS: The demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, genetic, nutrient, and lifestyle variables of 8842 participants were included. The polygenetic risk scores (PRS) generated by a genome-wide association study were added to represent the genetic impact of insulin resistance. They were divided randomly into the training (n = 7037) and test (n = 1769) sets. Potentially important features were selected in the highest area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve from 99 features using seven different ML algorithms. The AUC target was >/=0.85 for the best prediction of insulin resistance with the lowest number of features. RESULTS: The cutoff of insulin resistance defined with HOMA-IR was 2.31 using logistic regression before conducting ML. XGBoost and logistic regression algorithms generated the highest AUC (0.86) of the prediction models using 99 features, while the random forest algorithm generated a model with 0.82 AUC. These models showed high accuracy and k-fold values (>0.85). The prediction model containing 15 features had the highest AUC of the ROC curve in XGBoost and random forest algorithms. PRS was one of 15 features. The final prediction models for insulin resistance were generated with the same nine features in the XGBoost (AUC = 0.86), random forest (AUC = 0.84), and artificial neural network (AUC = 0.86) algorithms. The model included the fasting serum glucose, ALT, total bilirubin, HDL concentrations, waist circumference, body fat, pulse, season to enroll in the study, and gender. CONCLUSION: The liver function, regular pulse checking, and seasonal variation in addition to metabolic syndrome components should be considered to predict insulin resistance in Koreans aged over 40 years."

        "abstract": "Kidney failure is frequently observed during and after COVID-19, but it remains elusive whether this is a direct effect of the virus. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney cells and is associated with increased tubule-interstitial kidney fibrosis in patient autopsy samples. To study direct effects of the virus on the kidney independent of systemic effects of COVID-19, we infected human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived kidney organoids with SARS-CoV-2. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated injury and dedifferentiation of infected cells with activation of profibrotic signaling pathways. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection also led to increased collagen 1 protein expression in organoids. A SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor was able to ameliorate the infection of kidney cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect kidney cells and induce cell injury with subsequent fibrosis. These data could explain both acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and the development of chronic kidney disease in long COVID."

Here, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and single-cell proteomics with mechanistic studies to assess pathogenic T cell functions and inducing signals. We identified highly activated CD16(+) T cells with increased cytotoxic functions in severe COVID-19. CD16 expression enabled immune-complex-mediated, T cell receptor-independent degranulation and cytotoxicity not found in other diseases. CD16(+) T cells from COVID-19 patients promoted microvascular endothelial cell injury and release of neutrophil and monocyte chemoattractants. CD16(+) T cell clones persisted beyond acute disease maintaining their cytotoxic phenotype. Increased generation of C3a in severe COVID-19 induced activated CD16(+) cytotoxic T cells. Proportions of activated CD16(+) T cells and plasma levels of complement proteins upstream of C3a were associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, supporting a pathological role of exacerbated cytotoxicity and complement activation in COVID-19."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a near limitless supply of human cells that can be differentiated into cell types of interest, including airway epithelium, for disease modeling. We present a human iPSC-derived airway epithelial platform, composed of the major airway epithelial cell types, that is permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsets of iPSC-airway cells express the SARS-CoV-2 entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Multiciliated cells are the primary initial target of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On infection with SARS-CoV-2, iPSC-airway cells generate robust interferon and inflammatory responses, and treatment with remdesivir or camostat mesylate causes a decrease in viral propagation and entry, respectively. In conclusion, iPSC-derived airway cells provide a physiologically relevant in vitro model system to interrogate the pathogenesis of, and develop treatment strategies for, COVID-19 pneumonia."

        "abstract": "Many of the approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on a stabilized variant of the spike protein. This raises the question of whether the immune response against the stabilized spike is identical to the immune response that is elicited by the native spike in the case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using a peptide array-based approach, we analysed the binding of antibodies from Comirnaty-elicited, convalescent, and control sera to the peptides covering the spike protein. A total of 37 linear epitopes were identified. A total of 26 of these epitopes were almost exclusively recognized by the convalescent sera. Mapping these epitopes to the spike structures revealed that most of these 26 epitopes are masked in the pre-fusion structure. In particular, in the conserved central helix, three epitopes that are only exposed in the post-fusion conformation were identified. This indicates a higher spike-specific antibody diversity in convalescent sera. These differences could be relevant for the breadth of spike-specific immune response."

The increasing incidence of T2DM reflects an urgent need for the development of in vitro human-relevant models for disease study and drug therapy. Here, a new microfluidic multi-organoid system is developed that recapitulates the human liver-pancreatic islet axis in normal and disease states. The system contains two compartmentalized regions connected by a microchannel network, enabling 3D co-culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived liver and islet organoids for up to 30 days under circulatory perfusion conditions. The co-cultured liver and islet organoids exhibit favorable growth and improved tissue-specific functions. Transcriptional analyses reveal the activation of metabolically relevant signaling pathways in the co-cultured organoids. Notably, the co-culture system facilitates sensitive glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islet organoids and increased glucose utilization in liver organoids by glucose tolerance tests. Both liver and islet organoids display mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased glucose transport capacity under high glucose conditions, which can be alleviated by metformin treatment. This novel multi-organoid system can recapitulate human-relevant liver-islet axis under both physiological and pathological conditions, providing a unique platform for future T2DM research and drug development."

        "abstract": "As in past pandemics, co-circulating pathogens may play a role in the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In particular, experimental evidence indicates that influenza infection can up-regulate the expression of ACE2-the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells-and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we hypothesized that influenza impacted the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early 2020 epidemic of COVID-19 in Europe. To test this hypothesis, we developed a population-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and of COVID-19 mortality, which simultaneously incorporated the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures and of influenza on the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Using statistical inference methods based on iterated filtering, we confronted this model with mortality incidence data in four European countries (Belgium, Italy, Norway, and Spain) to systematically test a range of assumptions about the impact of influenza. We found consistent evidence for a 1.8-3.4-fold (uncertainty range across countries: 1.1 to 5.0) average population-level increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with influenza during the period of co-circulation. These estimates remained robust to a variety of alternative assumptions regarding the epidemiological traits of SARS-CoV-2 and the modeled impact of control measures. Although further confirmatory evidence is required, our results suggest that influenza could facilitate the spread and hamper effective control of SARS-CoV-2. More generally, they highlight the possible role of co-circulating pathogens in the epidemiology of COVID-19."

Here we report a method for rapid, efficient, activation-neutral gene editing of resting, polyclonal human CD4(+) T cells using optimized cell cultivation and nucleofection conditions of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes. Up to six genes, including HIV dependency and restriction factors, were knocked out individually or simultaneously and functionally characterized. Moreover, we demonstrate the knock in of double-stranded DNA donor templates into different endogenous loci, enabling the study of the physiological interplay of cellular and viral components at single-cell resolution. Together, this technique allows improved molecular and functional characterizations of HIV biology and general immune functions in resting CD4(+) T cells."

To this end, cardiac samples with a cross-section of 3.5mm were scanned at a laboratory setup as well as at a parallel beam setup at a synchrotron radiation facility the synchrotron in a parallel beam configuration. The vascular network was segmented by a deep learning architecture suitable for 3d datasets (V-net), trained by sparse manual annotations. Pathological alterations of vessels, concerning the variation of diameters and the amount of small holes, were observed, indicative of elevated occurrence of intussusceptive angiogenesis, also confirmed by high-resolution cone beam X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, we implemented a fully automated analysis of the tissue structure in the form of shape measures based on the structure tensor. The corresponding distributions show that the histopathology of Covid-19 differs from both influenza and typical coxsackie virus myocarditis."

Using three independent insulin sensitivity assays, i.e., glucose and fatty acid uptake and suppression of lipolysis, as the functional readouts new differentiation conditions yielding hormonally responsive iADIPO are derived. Through concomitant optimization of an iADIPO-MPS, it is abled to obtain WAT with more unilocular and significantly larger ( approximately 40%) lipid droplets compared to iADIPO in 2D culture, increased insulin responsiveness of glucose uptake ( approximately 2-3 fold), fatty acid uptake ( approximately 3-6 fold), and  approximately 40% suppressing of stimulated lipolysis giving a dynamic range that is competent to current in vivo and ex vivo models, allowing to identify both insulin sensitizers and desensitizers."

Host factors strongly influence infection outcome as malnourished or immunocompromised individuals can develop invasive infections from NTS, however, comparative analyses of serovar-specific host responses have been constrained by reliance on limited model systems. Here we used human intestinal organoids (HIOs), a three-dimensional \"gut-like\" in vitro system derived from human embryonic stem cells, to elucidate similarities and differences in host responses to NTS and typhoidal serovars. HIOs discriminated between the two most prevalent NTS, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE), and typhoidal serovar Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (ST) in epithelial cell invasion, replication and transcriptional responses. Pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine output was reduced in ST-infected HIOs compared to NTS infections, consistent with early stages of NTS and typhoidal diseases. While we predicted that ST would induce a distinct transcriptional profile from the NTS strains, more nuanced expression profiles emerged. Notably, pathways involved in cell cycle, metabolism and mitochondrial functions were downregulated in STM-infected HIOs and upregulated in SE-infected HIOs. These results correlated with suppression of cellular proliferation and induction of host cell death in STM-infected HIOs and in contrast, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species production in SE-infected HIOs. Collectively, these results suggest that the HIO model is well suited to reveal host transcriptional programming specific to infection by individual Salmonella serovars, and that individual NTS may provoke unique host epithelial responses during intestinal stages of infection."

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 4,351 patients with PCOS receiving IVF/ICSI in our reproductive medical center. The clinical cases were randomly divided into a modeling group (3,231 cases) and a verification group (1,120 cases) according to a ratio of about 3:1. The independent risk factors correlation with the occurrence of OHSS was identified by logistic regression analysis. Based on the selected independent risk factors and correlated regression coefficients, we established a nomogram model to predict the probability of OHSS in PCOS patients, and the predictive accuracy of the model was measured using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that FSH (OR, 0.901; 95% CI, 0.847-0.958; P<0.001), AMH (OR, 1.259; 95% CI, 1.206-1.315; P<0.001), E2 value on the day of hCG injection (OR, 1.122; 95% CI, 1.021-1.253; P<0.001), total dosage of Gn used (OR, 1.010; 95% CI, 1.002-1.016; P=0.041), and follicle number on the day of hCG injection (OR, 0.134; 95% CI, 1.020-1.261; P=0.020) are the independent risk factors for OHSS in PCOS patients. The AUC of the modeling group is 0.827 (95% CI, 0.795-0.859), and the AUC of the verification group is 0.757 (95% CI, 0.733-0.782). CONCLUSION: The newly established nomogram model has proven to be a novel tool that can effectively, easily, and intuitively predict the probability of OHSS in the patients with PCOS, by which the clinician can set up a better clinical management strategies for conducting a precise personal therapy."

Here we propose the use of human liver organoids as a platform for modeling HBV infection and related tumorigenesis. We first describe a primary ex vivo HBV-infection model derived from healthy donor liver organoids after challenge with recombinant virus or HBV-infected patient serum. HBV-infected organoids produced covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and HBV early antigen (HBeAg), expressed intracellular HBV RNA and proteins, and produced infectious HBV. This ex vivo HBV-infected primary differentiated hepatocyte organoid platform was amenable to drug screening for both anti-HBV activity and drug-induced toxicity. We also studied HBV replication in transgenically modified organoids; liver organoids exogenously overexpressing the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) after lentiviral transduction were not more susceptible to HBV, suggesting the necessity for additional host factors for efficient infection. We also generated transgenic organoids harboring integrated HBV, representing a long-term culture system also suitable for viral production and the study of HBV transcription. Finally, we generated HBV-infected patient-derived liver organoids from non-tumor cirrhotic tissue of explants from liver transplant patients. Interestingly, transcriptomic analysis of patient-derived liver organoids indicated the presence of an aberrant early cancer gene signature, which clustered with the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohort on The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma dataset and away from healthy liver tissue, and may provide invaluable novel biomarkers for the development of HCC and surveillance in HBV-infected patients."

        "abstract": "Clinical evidence suggests the central nervous system is frequently impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or indirectly, although the mechanisms are unclear. Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Before infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral 'replication hubs', with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new 'assembloid' model that supports astrocytic maturation as well as SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue; thus, PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection."

Here, we present a new generation of the microfluidic hanging-drop-based islet perifusion platform that was developed to study the alterations in insulin secretion dynamics from single pancreatic islet microtissues at high temporal resolution. The platform was completely redesigned to increase experimental throughput and to reduce operational complexity. The experimental throughput was increased fourfold by implementing a network of interconnected hanging drops, which allows for performing GSIS assays with four individual islet microtissues in parallel with a sampling interval of 30 s. We introduced a self-regulating drop-height mechanism that enables continuous flow and maintains a constant liquid volume in the chip, which enables simple and robust operation. Upon glucose stimulation, reproducible biphasic insulin release was simultaneously observed from all islets in the system. The measured insulin concentrations showed low sample-to-sample variation as a consequence of precise liquid handling with stable drop volumes, equal flow rates in the channels, and accurately controlled sampling volumes in all four drops. The presented device will be a valuable tool in islet and diabetes research for studying dynamic insulin secretion from individual pancreatic islets."

LDLR knockout animals and in vitro cell models overexpressing different mutations have proved useful, but may not fully recapitulate human LDLR mutation biology. We and others have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from hoFH patient's fibroblasts and T cells and demonstrated their ability to recapitulate hoFH biology. In this study, we present the generation and characterization of a cohort of seven hoFH-iPSC lines derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from four homozygous and three compound heterozygous patients. The hoFH-iPSC cohort demonstrated a wide range of LDLR expression and LDL-C internalization in response to rosuvastatin that correlated with the predicted pathogenicity of the mutation. We were able to confirm that hoFH-iPSC cohort were pluripotent by differentiation toward all three germ layers and specifically to hepatocyte-like cells (HLC), the cell with primary LDL-C metabolic regulatory control, by expression of hepatocyte markers. hoFH patient PBMC-derived iPSC recapitulate the LDLR dysfunction of their specific mutation. They were capable of differentiating to HLC and could be useful for early developmental studies, pharmacology/toxicology, and potentially autologous cell therapy."

Based on epidemiological evidence, it is known that the patients suffering from obesity are considered to be at a significantly higher risk of type-2 diabetes. There are several pieces of evidence that support the hypothesis that these diseases interlinked and obesity may aggravate the risk(s) of type-2 diabetes. Multi-level unwanted alterations such as (epi-) genetic alterations, changes at the transcriptional level, and altered signaling pathways (receptor, cytoplasmic, and nuclear level) are the major sources that promote several complex diseases, and such a heterogeneous level of complexity is considered as a major barrier in the development of therapeutics. With so many known challenges, it is critical to understand the relationships and the shared causes between type-2 diabetes and obesity, and these are difficult to unravel and understand. For this purpose, we have selected publicly available datasets of gene expression for obesity and type-2 diabetes, have unraveled the genes and the pathways associated with the immune system, and have also focused on the T-cell signaling pathway and its components. We have applied a simplified computational approach to understanding differential gene expression and patterns and the enriched pathways for obesity and type-2 diabetes. Furthermore, we have also analyzed genes by using network-level understanding. In the analysis, we observe that there are fewer genes that are commonly differentially expressed while a comparatively higher number of pathways are shared between them. There are only 4 pathways that are associated with the immune system in case of obesity and 10 immune-associated pathways in case of type-2 diabetes, and, among them, only 2 pathways are commonly altered. Furthermore, we have presented SPNS1, PTPN6, CD247, FOS, and PIK3R5 as the overexpressed genes, which are the direct components of TCR signaling."

By applying bioinformatics analysis to mass cytometry (CyTOF)-phenotyped specimens from individuals with viremia and in-vitro-infected cells from uninfected donors, we provide an atlas of the phenotypes of in vivo and in vitro HIV-susceptible cells. T helper 17 (Th17) and alpha4beta1(+) cells are preferentially targeted in vivo, whereas T effector memory (Tem), T transitional memory (Ttm), Th1, and Th1/Th17 subsets are targeted in vitro. Multiple proteins-including chemokine and cytokine receptors-are remodeled by HIV in vivo, and these changes are mostly recapitulated in vitro. HIV remodels cells to a T follicular helper (Tfh) phenotype. Using clustering, we uncover a subset of CD29-expressing, Tem-like cells that are highly susceptible to infection in vivo and in vitro and experimentally confirm that susceptibility. These studies provide an in-depth look at features of HIV-susceptible cells in individuals with viremia and demonstrate that some-but not all-HIV-susceptible cells identified in vitro effectively model in vivo susceptibility."

METHODS: Serum samples from 330 participants, including 109 with gout, 102 with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and 119 normouricemic controls, were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Multivariate principal components analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis were performed to explore differential metabolites and pathways. A multivariate methods with Unbiased Variable selection in R (MUVR) algorithm was performed to identify potential biomarkers and build multivariate diagnostic models using 3 machine learning algorithms: random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Univariate analysis demonstrated that there was a greater difference between the metabolic profiles of patients with gout and normouricemic controls than between the metabolic profiles of individuals with hyperuricemia and normouricemic controls, while gout and hyperuricemia showed clear metabolomic differences. Pathway enrichment analysis found diverse significantly dysregulated pathways in individuals with hyperuricemia and patients with gout compared to normouricemic controls, among which arginine metabolism appeared to play a critical role. The multivariate diagnostic model using MUVR found 13 metabolites as potential biomarkers to differentiate hyperuricemia and gout from normouricemia. Two-thirds of the samples were randomly selected as a training set, and the remainder were used as a validation set. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of 7 metabolites yielded an area under the curve of 0.83-0.87 in the training set and 0.78-0.84 in the validation set for distinguishing gout from asymptomatic hyperuricemia by 3 machine learning algorithms. CONCLUSION: Gout and hyperuricemia have distinct serum metabolomic signatures. This diagnostic model has the potential to improve current gout care through early detection or prediction of progression to gout from hyperuricemia."

        "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, is characterized by hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance (IR); however, the pathogenesis of local ovarian IR in PCOS remains largely unclear. Humanin, a mitochondria-derived peptide, has been reported to be associated with IR. Our previous study confirmed that humanin is expressed in multiple cell types in the ovary and is present in follicular fluid. However, it remains unknown whether humanin participates in the pathogenesis of local ovarian IR or whether humanin supplementation can improve IR in PCOS patients. In this study, we compared humanin concentrations in follicular fluid from PCOS patients with and without IR. We further investigated the effect of humanin analogue (HNG) supplementation on IR in a rat model of dehydroepiandrosterone-induced PCOS. Humanin concentrations in the follicular fluid were found to be significantly lower in PCOS patients with IR than in those without IR. HNG supplementation attenuated both the increases in the levels of fasting plasma glucose and fasting insulin in rats with PCOS and the decreases in phosphorylation of IRS1, PI3K, AKT, and GLUT4 proteins in the granulosa cells of these rats. Combined supplementation with HNG and insulin significantly improved glucose consumption in normal and humanin-siRNA-transfected COV434 cells. In conclusion, downregulated humanin in the ovaries may be involved in the pathogenesis of IR in PCOS, and exogenous supplementation with HNG improved local ovarian IR through modulation of the IRS1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in a rat model. This finding supports the potential future use of HNG as a therapeutic drug for PCOS."

Here, a polydimethylsiloxane-free MPS that enables continuous dynamic culture and serial in situ multiparametric assessments was leveraged to culture organoids, specifically human and rodent pancreatic islets, within a 3D alginate hydrogel. Computational modeling predicted reduced hypoxic stress and improved insulin secretion compared to static culture. Experimental validation via serial, high-content, and noninvasive assessments quantitatively confirmed that the MPS platform retained organoid viability and functionality for at least 10 days, in stark contrast to the acute decline observed overnight under static conditions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a dynamic in vitro microenvironment for the preservation of primary organoid function and the utility of this MPS for in situ multiparametric assessment."

We use this system to define the essential cellular components necessary to produce an influenza vaccine response. We also show that it can be used to evaluate humoral immune responses to two priming antigens, rabies vaccine and an adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine, and to assess the effects of different adjuvants. This system should prove useful for studying critical mechanisms underlying adaptive immunity in much greater depth than previously possible and to rapidly test vaccine candidates and adjuvants in an entirely human system."

Nowadays an ex-herbicide, nitisinone, is used for this purpose and many more inhibitors are being explored and need to be tested.

For this high-throughput screening (HTS) system we rely on the capability of recombinant E. coli that express human HPD, to generate a brown ochronotic pigment after the addition of tyrosine, whereafter this brown pigment can be quantified in a very specific and sensitive way by spectrophotometric analysis. Altogether, this robust and simple HTS screening system can be described as non-harmful, non-laborious and cost-effective with the aim to identify and evaluate novel therapeutic human HPD inhibitors for the treatment of TIMD.*This robust high-throughput screening system enables rapid identification and evaluation of potential inhibitors of human 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase.*Simple and fast colorimetric quantification of the formation of ochronotic pigment."

Treatment approaches of diabetes and identification of the mechanisms underlying diabetic complications of the skin have gained importance due to continued rapid increase in the diabetes incidence. A thick and pre-vascularized in vitro 3D type 2 diabetic human skin model (DHSM) was developed in this study. The methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogel was produced by photocrosslinking and its pore size (54.85 +/- 8.58 mum), compressive modulus (4.53 +/- 0.67 kPa) and swelling ratio (17.5 +/- 2.2%) were found to be suitable for skin tissue engineering. 8% GelMA hydrogel effectively supported the viability, spreading and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts. By isolating dermal fibroblasts, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and keratinocytes from type 2 diabetic patients, an in vitro 3D type 2 DHSM, 12 mm in width and 1.86 mm thick, was constructed. The skin model consisted of a continuous basal epidermal layer and a dermal layer with blood capillary-like structures, ideal for evaluating the effects of anti-diabetic drugs and wound healing materials and factors. The functionality of the DHSM was showed by applying a therapeutic hydrogel into its central wound; especially fibroblast migration to the wound site was evident in 9 d. We have demonstrated that DHSM is a biologically relevant model with sensitivity and predictability in evaluating the diabetic wound healing potential of a therapeutic material."

To get a grip on this outbreak, specific preventive and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. It must be said that, until now, there are no existing vaccines for coronaviruses. To promptly and rapidly respond to pandemic events, the application of in silico trials can be used for designing and testing medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and speed-up the vaccine discovery pipeline, predicting any therapeutic failure and minimizing undesired effects. RESULTS: We present an in silico platform that showed to be in very good agreement with the latest literature in predicting SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and related immune system host response. Moreover, it has been used to predict the outcome of one of the latest suggested approach to design an effective vaccine, based on monoclonal antibody. Universal Immune System Simulator (UISS) in silico platform is potentially ready to be used as an in silico trial platform to predict the outcome of vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: In silico trials are showing to be powerful weapons in predicting immune responses of potential candidate vaccines. Here, UISS has been extended to be used as an in silico trial platform to speed-up and drive the discovery pipeline of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2."

Here, we use human-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived brain organoids to examine SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. We find expression of viral receptor ACE2 in mature choroid plexus cells expressing abundant lipoproteins, but not in neurons or other cell types. We challenge organoids with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus and live virus to demonstrate viral tropism for choroid plexus epithelial cells but little to no infection of neurons or glia. We find that infected cells are apolipoprotein- and ACE2-expressing cells of the choroid plexus epithelial barrier.

Myosin A binds two light chains which further interact with glideosome associated proteins and assemble into the glideosome. The role of individual glideosome proteins is unclear due to the lack of structures of larger glideosome assemblies. Here, we investigate the role of essential light chains (ELCs) in Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum and present their crystal structures as part of trimeric sub-complexes. We show that although ELCs bind a conserved MyoA sequence, P. falciparum ELC adopts a distinct structure in the free and MyoA-bound state. We suggest that ELCs enhance MyoA performance by inducing secondary structure in MyoA and thus stiffen its lever arm. Structural and biophysical analysis reveals that calcium binding has no influence on the structure of ELCs. Our work represents a further step towards understanding the mechanism of gliding in Apicomplexa."

        "abstract": "AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has emerged as a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether cardiac injury is caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Here, we investigate whether cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two strains of SARS-CoV-2 infected human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as demonstrated by detection of intracellular double-stranded viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein expression. Increasing concentrations of viral RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in Caco-2 cell lines, documenting productive infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection and induced cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects associated with it abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signalling, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a 3D cardiosphere tissue model. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus particles were further observed in cardiomyocytes of a patient with coronavirus disease 2019. Infection of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes was dependent on cathepsins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and was blocked by remdesivir. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infects cardiomyocytes in vitro in an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2- and cathepsin-dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes is inhibited by the antiviral drug remdesivir."

        "abstract": "HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is characterized by neuroinflammation and glial activation that, together with the release of viral proteins, trigger a pathogenic cascade resulting in synaptodendritic damage and neurodegeneration that lead to cognitive impairment. However, the molecular events underlying HIV neuropathogenesis remain elusive, mainly due to lack of brain-representative experimental systems to study HIV-CNS pathology. To fill this gap, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) human brain organoid (hBORG) model containing major cell types important for HIV-1 neuropathogenesis; neurons and astrocytes along with incorporation of HIV-infected microglia. Both infected and uninfected microglia infiltrated into hBORGs resulting in a triculture system (MG-hBORG) that mirrors the multicellular network observed in HIV-infected human brain. Moreover, the MG-hBORG model supported productive viral infection and exhibited increased inflammatory response by HIV-infected MG-hBORGs, releasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1beta) and thereby mimicking the chronic neuroinflammatory environment observed in HIV-infected individuals. This model offers great promise for basic understanding of how HIV-1 infection alters the CNS compartment and induces pathological changes, paving the way for discovery of biomarkers and new therapeutic targets."

Single virus particles were detected using nanopores, and resistive-pulse waveforms were analyzed multilaterally using artificial intelligence. In the discrimination, over 99% accuracy for five different virus species was demonstrated. This advance is accessed through the classification of virus-derived ionic current signal patterns reflecting their intrinsic physical properties in a high-dimensional feature space. Moreover, consideration of viral similarity based on the accuracies indicates the contributing factors in the recognitions.

        "abstract": "Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal liver disease characterized by progressive fibroinflammatory obliteration of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The etiologies of BA remain largely unknown, but rotavirus infection has been implicated at least for a subset of patients, and this causal relation has been well demonstrated in mouse models. In this study, we aim to further consolidate this evidence in human biliary organoids. We obtained seven batches of human biliary organoids cultured from fetal liver, adult liver, and bile duct tissues. We found that these organoids are highly susceptible and support the full life cycle of rotavirus infection in three-dimensional culture. The robust infection triggers active virus-host interactions, including interferon-based host defense mechanisms and injury responses. We have observed direct cytopathogenesis in organoids upon rotavirus infection, which may partially recapitulate the development of BA. Importantly, we have demonstrated the efficacy of mycophenolic acid and interferon alpha but not ribavirin in inhibiting rotavirus in biliary organoids. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody targeting rotavirus VP7 protein effectively inhibits infection in organoids. Thus, we have substantiated the causal evidence of rotavirus inducing BA in humans and provided potential strategies to combat the disease.IMPORTANCE There is substantial evidence indicating the possible involvement of rotavirus in biliary atresia (BA) development, at least in a subset of patients, but concrete proof remains lacking. In a mouse model, it has been well demonstrated that rotavirus can infect the biliary epithelium to cause biliary inflammation and obstruction, representing the pathogenesis of BA in humans. By using recently developed organoids technology, we now have demonstrated that human biliary organoids are susceptible to rotavirus infection, and this provokes active virus-host interactions and causes severe cytopathogenesis. Thus, our model recapitulates some essential aspects of BA development. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibodies are capable of counteracting the infection and BA-like morphological changes, suggesting their potential for mitigating BA in patients."

        "abstract": "Iron homeostasis is essential for health; moreover, hepcidin-deficiency results in iron overload in both hereditary hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemia. Here, we identified iron modulators by functionally screening hepcidin agonists using a library of 640 FDA-approved drugs in human hepatic Huh7 cells. We validated the results in C57BL/6J mice and a mouse model of hemochromatosis (Hfe(-/-) mice). Our screen revealed that the anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug auranofin (AUR) potently upregulates hepcidin expression. Interestingly, we found that canonical signaling pathways that regulate iron, including the Bmp/Smad and IL-6/Jak2/Stat3 pathways, play indispensable roles in mediating AUR's effects. In addition, AUR induces IL-6 via the NF-kappaB pathway. In C57BL/6J mice, acute treatment with 5 mg/kg AUR activated hepatic IL-6/hepcidin signaling and decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation. Whereas chronically treating male Hfe(-/-) mice with 5 mg/kg AUR activated hepatic IL-6/hepcidin signaling, decreasing systemic iron overload, but less effective in females. Further analyses revealed that estrogen reduced the ability of AUR to induce IL-6/hepcidin signaling in Huh7 cells, providing a mechanistic explanation for ineffectiveness of AUR in female Hfe(-/-) mice. Notably, high-dose AUR (25 mg/kg) induces ferroptosis and causes lipid peroxidation through inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) activity. We demonstrate the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin significantly protects liver toxicity induced by high-dose AUR without comprising its beneficial effect on iron metabolism. In conclusion, our findings provide compelling evidence that TXNRD is a key regulator of ferroptosis, and AUR is a novel activator of hepcidin and ferroptosis via distinct mechanisms, suggesting a promising approach for treating hemochromatosis and hepcidin-deficiency related disorders."

While the organoid model has been used for both bacterial and viral infections, this is a closed system with the luminal side being inaccessible without microinjection or disruption of the organoid polarization. In order to overcome this and simplify their applicability for transepithelial studies, permeable membrane based monolayer approaches are needed. In this paper, we demonstrate a method for generating a monolayer model of the human fetal intestinal polarized epithelium that is fully characterized and validated. Proximal and distal small intestinal organoids were used to generate 2D monolayer cultures, which were characterized with respect to epithelial cell types, polarization, barrier function, and gene expression. In addition, viral replication and bacterial translocation after apical infection with enteric pathogens Enterovirus A71 and Listeria monocytogenes were evaluated, with subsequent monitoring of the pro-inflammatory host response. This human 2D fetal intestinal monolayer model will be a valuable tool to study host-pathogen interactions and potentially reduce the use of animals in research."

        "abstract": "Immature human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virions have a lattice of Gag and Gag-Pol proteins anchored to the lumen of their envelope. Using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that HIV virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled by the viral protein Gag and tagged at its C-terminus with the fluorescent protein Dendra2 have the same morphology and size as the VLPs assembled using only HIV Gag. We characterize the photophysical properties of Dendra2 and demonstrate that 60% of Dendra2 molecules can be photoswitched and reliably counted in our interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy (iPALM) setup. We further perform iPALM imaging on immobilized HIV Gag-Dendra2 VLPs and demonstrate that we can localize and count 900-1600 Dendra2 molecules within each immobilized VLP with a single-molecule localization precision better than (10 nm)(3). Our molecular counts correspond to 1400-2400 Gag-Dendra2 proteins incorporated within each VLP. We further calculate temporal correlation functions of localization data, which we present as localization correlation analysis, and show dynamics within the lattice of immobilized VLPs in the timescale of 10-100 s. We further use our localization data to reconstruct time-lapse iPALM images of the Gag-Dendra2 lattice within the lumen of immobilized VLPs. The iPALM time-lapse images show significant lattice dynamics within the lumen of VLPs. Addition of disuccinimidyl suberate to the VLPs completely abrogated these dynamics as observed in both localization correlation analysis and time-lapse iPALM. In a complementary approach, we utilized HaXS8 cross-linking reactions between Halo and SNAP proteins and verified lattice dynamics in purified VLPs incorporating 10% Gag-SNAP, 10% Gag-Halo, and 80% Gag proteins. The HIV Gag lattice, along with the structural lattice of other enveloped viruses, has been mostly considered static. Our study provides an important tool to investigate the dynamics within these enveloped viruses."

Human ileal organoids, engineered by CRISPR-Cas9, express the fluorescent protein Venus in the proglucagon locus, enabling maintenance of live, identifiable human L-cells in culture. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-purified organoid-derived L-cells, analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), express hormones, receptors, and ion channels, largely typical of their murine counterparts. L-cells are electrically active and exhibit membrane depolarization and calcium elevations in response to G-protein-coupled receptor ligands. Organoids secrete hormones in response to glucose and other stimuli. The ability to label and maintain human L-cells in organoid culture opens avenues to explore L-cell function and develop drugs targeting the human enteroendocrine system."

Commonly utilized in vitro models employ human or mouse preadipocyte cell lines in a 2-dimensional (2D) format. Due to the structural, biochemical, and biological limitations of these models, increased attention has been placed on \"organ on a chip\" technologies for a 3-dimensional (3D) culture.

Thus, the in vitro culture system demonstrates the critical characteristics required for a humanized 3D white adipose tissue (WAT) model."

Inflammation triggers pro-fibrotic signals that compromise lung structure and function. At present, several in vitro cystic fibrosis models have been developed to study epithelial dysfunction but none of these focuses on stromal alterations. Here we show a new cystic fibrosis 3D stromal lung model made up of primary fibroblasts embedded in their own extracellular matrix and investigate its morphological and transcriptomic features. Cystic fibrosis fibroblasts showed a high proliferation rate and produced an abundant and chaotic matrix with increased protein content and elastic modulus. More interesting, they had enhanced pro-fibrotic markers and genes involved in epithelial function and inflammatory response. In conclusion, our study reveals that cystic fibrosis fibroblasts maintain in vitro an activated pro-fibrotic state. This abnormality may play in vivo a role in the modulation of epithelial and inflammatory cell behavior and lung remodeling. We argue that the proposed bioengineered model may provide new insights on epithelial/stromal/inflammatory cells crosstalk in cystic fibrosis, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies."

Notably, the genomic contexts of colibactin-induced DNA double-strand breaks were enriched for an AT-rich hexameric sequence motif, associated with distinct DNA-shape characteristics. A survey of somatic mutations at colibactin target sites of several thousand cancer genomes revealed notable enrichment of this motif in colorectal cancers. Moreover, the exact double-strand-break loci corresponded with mutational hot spots in cancer genomes, reminiscent of a trinucleotide signature previously identified in healthy colorectal epithelial cells(3).

In order to search for additional biomarkers, we performed a pilot study comparing T2D patients with healthy controls matched by age, gender, and weight. By using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based metabolomics profiling of red blood cells (RBCs), we found that the metabolic signature of RBCs in T2D subjects differed significantly from non-diabetic controls. Affected metabolites included glutathione, 2,3-bisphophoglycerate, inosinic acid, lactate, 6-phosphogluconate, creatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and several amino acids such as leucine, glycine, alanine, lysine, aspartate, phenylalanine and tyrosine. These results were validated by an independent cohort of T2D and control patients. An analysis of the pathways in which these metabolites were involved showed that energetic and redox metabolism in RBCs were altered in T2D, as well as metabolites transported by RBCs. Taken together, our results revealed that the metabolic profile of RBCs can discriminate healthy controls from T2D patients. Further research is needed to determine whether metabolic fingerprint in RBC could be useful to complement the information obtained from HbA1c and glycemic variability as well as its potential role in the diabetes management."

This is a new method, optimized for live imaging, to study adipose tissue and cell-based mechanisms of obesity in particular. HATSC survival was tested by means of conventional and immunofluorescence histological techniques, functional analyses and live imaging. Surgery-derived tissue was cut with a tissue chopper in 500 mum sections and transferred onto membranes building an air-liquid interface. HATSC were cultured in six-well plates filled with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), insulin, transferrin, and selenium, both with and without serum. After 0, 1, 7 and 14 days in vitro, slices were fixated and analyzed by morphology and Perilipin A for tissue viability. Immunofluorescent staining against IBA1, CD68 and Ki67 was performed to determine macrophage survival and proliferation. These experiments showed preservation of adipose tissue as well as survival and proliferation of monocytes and stroma tissue for at least 14 days in vitro even in the absence of serum. The physiological capabilities of adipocytes were functionally tested by insulin stimulation and measurement of Phospho-Akt on day 7 and 14 in vitro. Viability was further confirmed by live imaging using Calcein-AM (viable cells) and propidium iodide (apoptosis/necrosis). In conclusion, HATSC have been successfully established by preserving the monovacuolar form of adipocytes and surrounding macrophages and connective tissue. This model allows further analysis of mature human adipose tissue biology ex vivo."

The functional consequence of PA or MMA is the inability to catabolize P-CoA to MM-CoA or MM-CoA to succinyl-CoA, resulting in the accumulation of P-CoA and other metabolic intermediates, such as propionylcarnitine (C3), 3-hydroxypropionic acid, methylcitric acid (MCA), and methylmalonic acid (only in MMA). P-CoA and its metabolic intermediates, at high concentrations found in PA and MMA, inhibit enzymes in the first steps of the urea cycle as well as enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, causing a reduction in mitochondrial energy production. We previously showed that metabolic defects of PA could be recapitulated using PA patient-derived primary hepatocytes in a novel organotypic system. Here, we sought to investigate whether treatment of normal human primary hepatocytes with propionate would recapitulate some of the biochemical features of PA and MMA in the same platform. We found that high levels of propionate resulted in high levels of intracellular P-CoA in normal hepatocytes. Analysis of TCA cycle intermediates by GC-MS/MS indicated that propionate may inhibit enzymes of the TCA cycle as shown in PA, but is also incorporated in the TCA cycle, which does not occur in PA. To better recapitulate the disease phenotype, we obtained hepatocytes derived from livers of PA and MMA patients. We characterized the PA and MMA donors by measuring key proximal biomarkers, including P-CoA, MM-CoA, as well as clinical biomarkers propionylcarnitine-to-acetylcarnitine ratios (C3/C2), MCA, and methylmalonic acid. Additionally, we used isotopically-labeled amino acids to investigate the contribution of relevant amino acids to production of P-CoA in models of metabolic stability or acute metabolic crisis. As observed clinically, we demonstrated that the isoleucine and valine catabolism pathways are the greatest sources of P-CoA in PA and MMA donor cells and that each donor showed differential sensitivity to isoleucine and valine. We also studied the effects of disodium citrate, an anaplerotic therapy, which resulted in a significant increase in the absolute concentration of TCA cycle intermediates, which is in agreement with the benefit observed clinically. Our human cell-based PA and MMA disease models can inform preclinical drug discovery and development where mouse models of these diseases are inaccurate, particularly in well-described species differences in branched-chain amino acid catabolism."

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been rapidly spreading around the globe(1,2). SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses; however, treatment options and an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 and show that inhibition of these pathways prevents viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell-culture model for infection with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Using this cell-culture system, we determined the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 by translatome(3) and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and nucleic acid metabolism. Small-molecule inhibitors that target these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and have enabled the identification of drugs that inhibit viral replication. We anticipate that our results will guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of host cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, our findings provide insights for the development of therapies for the treatment of COVID-19."

However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the human intestine and contributes to possible fecal-oral transmission. Here, we report productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2(+) mature enterocytes in human small intestinal enteroids. Expression of two mucosa-specific serine proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, facilitated SARS-CoV-2 spike fusogenic activity and promoted virus entry into host cells. We also demonstrate that viruses released into the intestinal lumen were inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid, and infectious virus was not recovered from the stool specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results highlight the intestine as a potential site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, which may contribute to local and systemic illness and overall disease progression."

No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. CONCLUSION: Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and on S protein priming by TMPRSS2. Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The parameters used for each COVID-19-positive patient were sex, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and ADT. RESULTS: There were evaluable 9280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in Veneto on 1 April 2020. Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females. Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT with patients with any other type of cancer (OR 4.86; 95% CI 1.88-12.56). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with non-cancer patients. However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections."

        "abstract": "Reverse genetics has been an indispensable tool to gain insights into viral pathogenesis and vaccine development. The genomes of large RNA viruses, such as those from coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and manipulate in Escherichia coli owing to the size and occasional instability of the genome(1-3). Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse-genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform to genetically reconstruct diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Pneumoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples or synthetic DNA, and these fragments were then reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation-associated recombination cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome. T7 RNA polymerase was then used to generate infectious RNA to rescue viable virus. Using this platform, we were able to engineer and generate chemically synthesized clones of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(4), which has caused the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance that we describe here facilitates rapid responses to emerging viruses as it enables the real-time generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants during an outbreak."

However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy. Enterocytes produced infectious viral particles, whereas messenger RNA expression analysis of hSIOs revealed induction of a generic viral response program. Therefore, the intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hSIOs serve as an experimental model for coronavirus infection and biology."

There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19."

For this retrospective study, we included 168 consecutive severe patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized between January 16th and February 4th, 2020, at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and outcomes were compared and analyzed between males and females. In the present study, we analyzed 168 severe patients with COVID-19, including 86 males and 82 females, and 48 patients (28.6%) were diagnosed as critically ill. Of 86 male patients, 12.8% (11/86) died and 75.6% (65/86) were discharged; of 82 female patients, 7.3% (6/82) died and 86.6% (71/82) were discharged. Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, males with comorbidities presented a higher risk of being critically ill than males without comorbidities (OR = 3.824, 95% CI = 1.279-11.435). However, this association attenuated to null in female patients (OR = 2.992, 95% CI = 0.937-9.558). A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions. We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities. Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."

ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2.

In the absence of protective immunity, as in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients, HAdV infections can become lethal. Alarmingly, various outbreaks of highly pathogenic, pneumotropic HAdV types have been recently reported, causing severe and lethal respiratory diseases. Effective drugs for treatment of HAdV infections are still lacking. The repurposing of drugs approved for other indications is a valuable alternative for the development of new antiviral therapies and is less risky and costly than de novo development. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is approved for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here, it is shown that ATO is a potent inhibitor of HAdV. ATO treatment blocks virus expression and replication by reducing the number and integrity of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, important subnuclear structures for HAdV replication. Modification of HAdV proteins with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) is also key to HAdV replication. ATO reduces levels of viral SUMO-E2A protein, while increasing SUMO-PML, suggesting that ATO interferes with SUMOylation of proteins crucial for HAdV replication. It is concluded that ATO targets cellular processes key to HAdV replication and is relevant for the development of antiviral intervention strategies."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bacterial translocation to various organs including human adipose tissue (AT) due to increased intestinal permeability remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that: (1) bacterial presence is highly tissue specific and (2) related in composition and quantity to immune inflammatory and metabolic burden. DESIGN: We quantified and sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene in blood and AT samples (omental, mesenteric and subcutaneous) of 75 subjects with obesity with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D) and used catalysed reporter deposition (CARD) - fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to detect bacteria in AT. RESULTS: Under stringent experimental and bioinformatic control for contaminants, bacterial DNA was detected in blood and omental, subcutaneous and mesenteric AT samples in the range of 0.1 to 5 pg/microg DNA isolate. Moreover, CARD-FISH allowed the detection of living, AT-borne bacteria. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the predominant phyla, and bacterial quantity was associated with immune cell infiltration, inflammatory and metabolic parameters in a tissue-specific manner. Bacterial composition differed between subjects with and without T2D and was associated with related clinical measures, including systemic and tissues-specific inflammatory markers. Finally, treatment of adipocytes with bacterial DNA in vitro stimulated the expression of TNFA and IL6. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides contaminant aware evidence for the presence of bacteria and bacterial DNA in several ATs in obesity and T2D and suggests an important role of bacteria in initiating and sustaining local AT subclinical inflammation and therefore impacting metabolic sequelae of obesity."

        "abstract": "Obesity and its numerous adverse health consequences have taken on global, pandemic proportions. White adipose tissue (WAT) - a key contributor in many metabolic diseases - contributes about one fourth of a healthy human's body mass. Despite its significance, many WAT-related pathophysiogical mechanisms in humans are still not understood, largely due to the reliance on non-human animal models. In recent years, Organ-on-a-chip (OoC) platforms have developed into promising alternatives for animal models; these systems integrate engineered human tissues into physiological microenvironment supplied by a vasculature-like microfluidic perfusion. Here, we report the development of a novel OoC that integrates functional mature human white adipocytes. The WAT-on-a-chip is a multilayer device that features tissue chambers tailored specifically for the maintenance of 3D tissues based on human primary adipocytes, with supporting nourishment provided through perfused media channels. The platform's capability to maintain long-term viability and functionality of white adipocytes was confirmed by real-time monitoring of fatty acid uptake, by quantification of metabolite release into the effluent media as well as by an intact responsiveness to a therapeutic compound. The novel system provides a promising tool for wide-ranging applications in mechanistic research of WAT-related biology, in studying of pathophysiological mechanisms in obesity and diabetes, and in R&D of pharmaceutical industry."

The receptor harbors two distinct binding sites, uridine and di- and/or trinucleotides, but the RNases upstream of TLR8 remain poorly characterized. We identified two endolysosomal endoribonucleases, RNase T2 and RNase 2, that act synergistically to release uridine from oligoribonucleotides. RNase T2 cleaves preferentially before, and RNase 2 after, uridines. Live bacteria, P. falciparum-infected red blood cells, purified pathogen RNA, and synthetic oligoribonucleotides all required RNase 2 and T2 processing to activate TLR8. Uridine supplementation restored RNA recognition in RNASE2(-/-) or RNASET2(-/-) but not RNASE2(-/-)RNASET2(-/-) cells. Primary immune cells from RNase T2-hypomorphic patients lacked a response to bacterial RNA but responded robustly to small-molecule TLR8 ligands. Our data identify an essential function of RNase T2 and RNase 2 upstream of TLR8 and provide insight into TLR8 activation."

        "abstract": "Although there is a growing understanding of immunity against Candida albicans, efforts need to be pursued in order to decipher the cellular mechanisms leading to an uncontrolled immune response that eventually oppose disease eradication. We describe here significant intra- and inter-subject variations in immune response patterns of major human leucocyte subsets following an in vitro challenge with C. albicans clinical isolates. We also observed that there are Candida isolate-dependent changes in leucocyte phenotypes. Through a combination of multiple fungal growth and flow cytometric measurements, coupled to the tSNE algorithm, we showed that significant proliferation differences exist among C. albicans isolates, leading to the calculation of a strain specific persistent index. Despite substantial inter-subject differences in T cells and stability of myeloid cells at baseline, our experimental approach highlights substantial immune cell composition changes and cytokine secretion profiles after C. albicans challenge. The significant secretion of IL-17 by CD66+ cells, IFN-gamma and IL-10 by CD4+ T cells 2 days after C. albicans challenge was associated with fungal control. Fungal persistence was associated with delayed secretion of IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-4, TNF-alpha and IL-10 by myeloid cells and IL-4 and TNF-alpha secretion by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Overall, this experimental and analytical approach is available for the monitoring of such fungal and human immune responses."

        "abstract": "Since the first suspected case of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be  approximately 4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be  approximately 3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be  approximately 2.6 based on confirmed cases and  approximately 2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around  approximately 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February."

Although the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are now being understood, physiological and pathological states of bone are still difficult to predict due to the complexity of intercellular signaling. We have now developed a novel in silico experimental platform, V-Bone, to integratively explore bone remodeling by linking complex microscopic molecular/cellular interactions to macroscopic tissue/organ adaptations. Mechano-biochemical couplings modeled in V-Bone relate bone adaptation to mechanical loading and reproduce metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteopetrosis. V-Bone also enables in silico perturbation on a specific signaling molecule to observe bone metabolic dynamics over time. We also demonstrate that this platform provides a powerful way to predict in silico therapeutic effects of drugs against metabolic bone diseases. We anticipate that these in silico experiments will substantially accelerate research into bone metabolism and remodeling."

        "abstract": "A major obstacle in infection biology is the limited ability to recapitulate human disease trajectories in traditional cell culture and animal models, which impedes the translation of basic research into clinics. Here, we introduce a three-dimensional (3D) intestinal tissue model to study human enteric infections at a level of detail that is not achieved by conventional two-dimensional monocultures. Our model comprises epithelial and endothelial layers, a primary intestinal collagen scaffold, and immune cells. Upon Salmonella infection, the model mimics human gastroenteritis, in that it restricts the pathogen to the epithelial compartment, an advantage over existing mouse models. Application of dual transcriptome sequencing to the Salmonella-infected model revealed the communication of epithelial, endothelial, monocytic, and natural killer cells among each other and with the pathogen. Our results suggest that Salmonella uses its type III secretion systems to manipulate STAT3-dependent inflammatory responses locally in the epithelium without accompanying alterations in the endothelial compartment. Our approach promises to reveal further human-specific infection strategies employed by Salmonella and other pathogens.IMPORTANCE Infection research routinely employs in vitro cell cultures or in vivo mouse models as surrogates of human hosts. Differences between murine and human immunity and the low level of complexity of traditional cell cultures, however, highlight the demand for alternative models that combine the in vivo-like properties of the human system with straightforward experimental perturbation. Here, we introduce a 3D tissue model comprising multiple cell types of the human intestinal barrier, a primary site of pathogen attack. During infection with the foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, our model recapitulates human disease aspects, including pathogen restriction to the epithelial compartment, thereby deviating from the systemic infection in mice. Combination of our model with state-of-the-art genetics revealed Salmonella-mediated local manipulations of human immune responses, likely contributing to the establishment of the pathogen's infection niche. We propose the adoption of similar 3D tissue models to infection biology, to advance our understanding of molecular infection strategies employed by bacterial pathogens in their human host."

        "abstract": "Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. The influenza virus can cause severe epidemics, which results in significant morbidity and mortality. Beyond the virulence of the virus itself, epidemiological data suggest that bacterial co-infections are the major cause of increased mortality. In this context, Staphylococcus aureus represents a frequent causative bacterial pathogen. Currently available models have several limitations in the analysis of the pathogenesis of infections, e.g. some bacterial toxins strongly act in a species-specific manner. Human 2D mono-cell culture models often fail to maintain the differentiation of alveolus-specific functions. A detailed investigation of the underlying pathogenesis mechanisms requires a physiological interaction of alveolus-specific cell types. The aim of the present work was to establish a human in vitro alveolus model system composed of vascular and epithelial cell structures with cocultured macrophages resembling the human alveolus architecture and functions. We demonstrate that high barrier integrity maintained for up to 14 d in our model containing functional tissue-resident macrophages. We show that flow conditions and the presence of macrophages increased the barrier function. The infection of epithelial cells induced a high inflammatory response that spread to the endothelium. Although the integrity of the epithelium was not compromised by a single infection or co-infection, we demonstrated significant endothelial cell damage associated with loss of barrier function. We established a novel immune-responsive model that reflects the complex crosstalk between pathogens and host. The in vitro model allows for the monitoring of spatiotemporal spreading of the pathogens and the characterization of morphological and functional alterations attributed to infection. The alveolus-on-a-chip represents a promising platform for mechanistic studies of host-pathogen interactions and the identification of molecular and cellular targets of novel treatment strategies in pneumonia."

We collected data about treatment, survival, hospitalization, metabolic control, and liver transplantation from patients with classic (i.e., severe; n = 176), intermediate (n = 6) and intermittent (n = 2) forms of MSUD. A total of 13,589 amino acid profiles were used to analyze leucine tolerance, amino acid homeostasis, estimated cerebral amino acid uptake, quantitative responses to anabolic therapy, and metabolic control after liver transplantation. Standard instruments were used to measure neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite advances in clinical care, classic MSUD remains a morbid and potentially fatal disorder. Stringent dietary therapy maintains metabolic variables within acceptable limits but is challenging to implement, fails to restore appropriate concentration relationships among circulating amino acids, and does not fully prevent cognitive and psychiatric disabilities. Liver transplantation eliminates the need for a prescription diet and safeguards patients from life-threatening metabolic crises, but is associated with predictable morbidities and does not reverse pre-existing neurological sequelae. There is a critical unmet need for safe and effective disease-modifying therapies for MSUD which can be implemented early in life. The biochemistry and physiology of MSUD and its response to liver transplantation afford key insights into the design of new therapies based on gene replacement or editing."

        "abstract": "Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacterium primarily infects the throat and upper airways and the produced diphtheria toxin (DT), which binds to the elongation factor 2 and blocks protein synthesis, can spread through the bloodstream and affect organs, such as the heart and kidneys. For more than 125 years, the therapy against diphtheria has been based on polyclonal horse sera directed against DT (diphtheria antitoxin; DAT). Animal sera have many disadvantages including serum sickness, batch-to-batch variation in quality and the use of animals for production. In this work, 400 human recombinant antibodies were generated against DT from two different phage display panning strategies using a human immune library. A panning in microtiter plates resulted in 22 unique in vitro neutralizing antibodies and a panning in solution combined with a functional neutralization screening resulted in 268 in vitro neutralizing antibodies. 61 unique antibodies were further characterized as scFv-Fc with 35 produced as fully human IgG1. The best in vitro neutralizing antibody showed an estimated relative potency of 454 IU/mg and minimal effective dose 50% (MED50%) of 3.0 pM at a constant amount of DT (4x minimal cytopathic dose) in the IgG format. The targeted domains of the 35 antibodies were analyzed by immunoblot and by epitope mapping using phage display. All three DT domains (enzymatic domain, translocation domain and receptor binding domain) are targets for neutralizing antibodies. When toxin neutralization assays were performed at higher toxin dose levels, the neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies was markedly reduced but this was largely compensated for by using two or more antibodies in combination, resulting in a potency of 79.4 IU/mg in the in vivo intradermal challenge assay. These recombinant antibody combinations are candidates for further clinical and regulatory development to replace equine DAT."

The hEHOs stably maintain phenotypic features of bipotential liver stem/progenitor cells that can differentiate into functional hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. The hEHOs can expand for 20 passages enabling large scale expansion to cell numbers requisite for industry or clinical programs. The cells from hEHOs display remarkable repopulation capacity in injured livers of FRG mice following transplantation, and they differentiate in vivo into mature hepatocytes. If implanted into the epididymal fat pads of immune-deficient mice, they do not generate non-hepatic lineages and have no tendency to form teratomas. We further develop a derivative model by incorporating human fetal liver mesenchymal cells (hFLMCs) into the hEHOs, referred to as hFLMC/hEHO, which can model alcoholic liver disease-associated pathophysiologic changes, including oxidative stress generation, steatosis, inflammatory mediators release and fibrosis, under ethanol treatment. Our work demonstrates that the hEHOs have considerable potential to be a novel, ex vivo pathophysiological model for studying alcoholic liver disease as well as a promising cellular source for treating human liver diseases."

However, the impact of mechanical forces on infections leading to diarrheal diseases remains largely unknown. Here, we addressed whether flow and peristalsis impact the infectivity of the human pathogen Shigella within a 3D colonic epithelium using Intestine-Chip technology. Strikingly, infection is significantly increased and minimal bacterial loads are sufficient to invade enterocytes from the apical side and trigger loss of barrier integrity, thereby shifting the paradigm about early stage Shigella invasion. Shigella quickly colonizes epithelial crypt-like invaginations and demonstrates the essential role of the microenvironment. Furthermore, by modulating the mechanical forces of the microenvironment, we find that peristalsis impacts Shigella invasion. Collectively, our results reveal that Shigella leverages the intestinal microenvironment by taking advantage of the microarchitecture and mechanical forces to efficiently invade the intestine. This approach will enable molecular and mechanistic interrogation of human-restricted enteric pathogens."

        "abstract": "The intestine is the primary reservoir of Candida albicans that can cause systemic infections in immunocompromised patients. In this reservoir, the fungus exists as a harmless commensal. However, antibiotic treatment can disturb the bacterial microbiota, facilitating fungal overgrowth and favoring pathogenicity. The current in vitro gut models that are used to study the pathogenesis of C. albicans investigate the state in which C. albicans behaves as a pathogen rather than as a commensal. We present a novel in vitro gut model in which the fungal pathogenicity is reduced to a minimum by increasing the biological complexity. In this model, enterocytes represent the epithelial barrier and goblet cells limit C. albicans adhesion and invasion. Significant protection against C. albicans-induced necrotic damage was achieved by the introduction of a microbiota of antagonistic lactobacilli. We demonstrated a time-, dose- and species-dependent protective effect against C. albicans-induced cytotoxicity. This required bacterial growth, which relied on the presence of host cells, but was not dependent on the competition for adhesion sites. Lactobacillus rhamnosus reduced hyphal elongation, a key virulence attribute. Furthermore, bacterial-driven shedding of hyphae from the epithelial surface, associated with apoptotic epithelial cells, was identified as a main and novel mechanism of damage protection. However, host cell apoptosis was not the driving mechanism behind shedding. Collectively, we established an in vitro gut model that can be used to experimentally dissect commensal-like interactions of C. albicans with a bacterial microbiota and the host epithelial barrier. We also discovered fungal shedding as a novel mechanism by which bacteria contribute to the protection of epithelial surfaces.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper."

To create a platform for the investigation of the underlying mechanisms, we established a three-dimensional microphysiological model of the human intestine. This model resembles organotypic microanatomical structures and includes tissue resident innate immune cells exhibiting features of mucosal macrophages and dendritic cells. The model displays the physiological immune tolerance of the intestinal lumen to microbial-associated molecular patterns and can, therefore, be colonised with living microorganisms. Functional studies on microbial interaction between probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus and the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans show that pre-colonization of the intestinal lumen of the model by L. rhamnosus reduces C. albicans-induced tissue damage, lowers its translocation, and limits fungal burden. We demonstrate that microbial interactions can be efficiently investigated using the in vitro model creating a more physiological and immunocompetent microenvironment. The intestinal model allows a detailed characterisation of the immune response, microbial pathogenicity mechanisms, and quantification of cellular dysfunction attributed to alterations in the microbial composition."

As a human-specific pathogen, in vivo models are greatly limited and pose a significant challenge. In vitro cell models have been developed, however, most lack critical BEC phenotypes limiting their usefulness. Human BECs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) retain BEC properties and offer the prospect of modeling the human-specific Nm interaction with BECs. Here, we exploit iPSC-BECs as a novel cellular model to study Nm host-pathogen interactions, and provide an overview of host responses to Nm infection. Using iPSC-BECs, we first confirmed that multiple Nm strains and mutants follow similar phenotypes to previously described models. The recruitment of the recently published pilus adhesin receptor CD147 underneath meningococcal microcolonies could be verified in iPSC-BECs. Nm was also observed to significantly increase the expression of pro-inflammatory and neutrophil-specific chemokines IL6, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, and CCL20, and the secretion of IFN-gamma and RANTES. For the first time, we directly observe that Nm disrupts the three tight junction proteins ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5, which become frayed and/or discontinuous in BECs upon Nm challenge. In accordance with tight junction loss, a sharp loss in trans-endothelial electrical resistance, and an increase in sodium fluorescein permeability and in bacterial transmigration, was observed. Finally, we established RNA-Seq of sorted, infected iPSC-BECs, providing expression data of Nm-responsive host genes. Altogether, this model provides novel insights into Nm pathogenesis, including an impact of Nm on barrier properties and tight junction complexes, and suggests that the paracellular route may contribute to Nm traversal of BECs."

We evaluated the in vitro glucocorticoid activity of all relevant adrenal steroid precursors occurring in patients with CAH. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study and translational research. INTERVENTION/MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adrenal steroid precursor concentrations before and 60 minutes after ACTH administration to 24 untreated patients with CAH (3 to 46 years) with proven cortisol deficiency (<500 nmol/L post-ACTH) measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were compared with six control patients (Mann-Whitney U test). Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation was determined by dual-luciferase assays in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with the GR and exposed to increasing amounts of adrenal steroid precursors for 24 hours. RESULTS: Blood concentrations of the steroid precursors 11-deoxycortisol (457 nmol/L, P = 0.003), 11-deoxycorticosterone (55 nmol/L, P = 0.003), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (610 nmol/L, P < 0.001), progesterone (29 nmol/L, P < 0.001), and 21-deoxycortisol (73 nmol/L) were strongly elevated compared with control subjects. The GR was activated with comparable potency to cortisol by corticosterone and 21-deoxycortisol or with 4 to 100 times lower potency by 11-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone. CONCLUSIONS: We identified strongly elevated adrenal steroid precursor concentrations in blood from untreated patients with CAH and demonstrated glucocorticoid activity of these adrenal precursors in vitro, suggesting a possible role of these precursors in the clinical phenotype of these patients. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the role of these precursors in more detail."

Here we use human fallopian tube organoids and genital Ctr serovars D, K and E for long-term in vitro analysis. The epithelial monolayer responds with active expulsion of the bacteria into the lumen and with compensatory cellular proliferation-demonstrating a role of epithelial homeostasis in the defense against this pathogen. In addition, Ctr infection activates LIF signaling, which we find to be an essential regulator of stemness in the organoids. Infected organoids exhibit a less differentiated phenotype with higher stemness potential, as confirmed by increased organoid forming efficiency. Moreover, Ctr increases hypermethylation of DNA, which is an indicator of accelerated molecular aging. Thus, the chronic organoid infection model suggests that Ctr has a long-term impact on the epithelium. These heritable changes might be a contributing factor in the development of tubal pathologies, including the initiation of high grade serous ovarian cancer."

Treatment often consists of a combination of reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. Here we use an existing computational modelling framework describing the long-term development of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) in APOE3L.CETP mice fed a high-fat diet containing cholesterol with a human-like metabolic system. This model was used to analyze energy expenditure and energy balance in a large set of individual model realizations. RESULTS: We developed and applied a strategy to select specific individual models for a detailed analysis of heterogeneity in energy metabolism. Models were stratified based on energy expenditure. A substantial surplus of energy was found to be present during MetS development, which explains the weight gain during MetS development. In the majority of the models, energy was mainly expended in the peripheral tissues, but also distinctly different subgroups were identified. In silico perturbation of the system to induce increased peripheral energy expenditure implied changes in lipid metabolism, but not in carbohydrate metabolism. In silico analysis provided predictions for which individual models increase of peripheral energy expenditure would be an effective treatment. CONCLUSION: The computational analysis confirmed that the energy imbalance plays an important role in the development of obesity. Furthermore, the model is capable to predict whether an increase in peripheral energy expenditure - for instance by cold exposure to activate brown adipose tissue (BAT) - could resolve MetS symptoms."

Recently, hPSC-derived organoids have represented a new class of in vitro organ models for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. However, rebuilding biomimetic human islet organoids from hPSCs remains challenging. Here, we present a new strategy to engineer human islet organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using an organ-on-a-chip platform combined with stem cell developmental principles. The microsystem contains a multi-layer microfluidic device that allows controllable aggregation of embryoid bodies (EBs), in situ pancreatic differentiation and generation of heterogeneous islet organoids in parallel under perfused 3D culture in a single device. The generated islet organoids contain heterogeneous islet-specific alpha and beta-like cells that exhibit favorable growth and cell viability. They also show enhanced expression of pancreatic beta-cell specific genes and proteins (PDX1 and NKX6.1) and increased beta-cell hormone specific INS gene and C-peptide protein expressions under perfused 3D culture conditions compared to static cultures. In addition, the islet organoids exhibit more sensitive glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and higher Ca2+ flux, indicating the role of biomimetic mechanical flow in promoting endocrine cell differentiation and maturation of islet organoids. This islet-on-a-chip system is robust and amenable to real-time imaging and in situ tracking of islet organoid growth, which may provide a promising platform for organoid engineering, disease modeling, drug testing and regenerative medicine."

PCR, immunological assays, and enzyme activity tests represent common methods to detect virus infections. We have screened more than 300 Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia RNA sequencing and 60 whole exome sequencing human cell lines data sets for specific viral sequences and general viral nucleotide and protein sequence assessment applying the Taxonomer bioinformatics tool developed by IDbyDNA. The results were compared with our previous findings from virus specific PCR analyses. Both, the results obtained from the direct alignment method and the Taxonomer alignment method revealed a complete concordance with the PCR results: twenty cell lines were found to be infected with five virus species. Taxonomer further uncovered a bovine polyomavirus infection in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 most likely introduced by contaminated fetal bovine serum. RNA-Seq data sets were more sensitive for virus detection although a significant proportion of cell lines revealed low numbers of virus specific alignments attributable to low level nucleotide contamination during RNA preparation or sequencing procedure. Low quality reads leading to Taxonomer false positive results can be eliminated by trimming the sequence data before analysis. One further important result is that no viruses were detected that had never been shown to occur in cell cultures. The results prove that the currently applied testing of cell cultures is adequate for the detection of contamination and for the risk assessment of cell cultures. The results emphasize that next generation sequencing is an efficient tool to determine the viral infection status of human cells."

        "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), together with 21st century cell culture methods, have the potential to better model human physiology with applications in toxicology, disease modeling, and the study of host-pathogen interactions. Several models of the human brain have been developed recently, demonstrating cell-cell interactions of multiple cell types with physiologically relevant 3D structures. Most current models, however, lack the ability to represent the inflammatory response in the brain because they do not include a microglial cell population. Microglia, the resident immunocompetent phagocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), are not only important in the inflammatory response and pathogenesis; they also function in normal brain development, strengthen neuronal connections through synaptic pruning, and are involved in oligodendrocyte and neuronal survival. Here, we have successfully introduced a population of human microglia into 3D human iPSC-derived brain spheres (BrainSpheres, BS) through co-culturing cells of the Immortalized Human Microglia - SV40 cell line with the BS model (muBS). We detected an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and flavivirus infection, which was only elicited in the model when microglial cells were present. A concentration of 20 ng/mL of LPS increased gene expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-1beta, with maximum expression at 6-12 h post-exposure. Increased expression of the IL-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) genes was observed in muBS following infection with Zika and Dengue Virus, suggesting a stronger inflammatory response in the model when microglia were present than when only astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and neuronal populations were represented. Microglia innately develop within cerebral organoids (Nature communications), our findings suggest that the muBS model is more physiologically relevant and has potential applications in infectious disease and host-pathogen interactions research."

Chronic hyperglycemia is linked to development of several ocular pathologies affecting the anterior segment, including diabetic corneal neuropathy and keratopathy, neovascular glaucoma, edema, and cataracts leading to significant visual defects. Due to increasing disease prevalence, related medical care costs, and visual impairment resulting from diabetes, a need has arisen to devise alternative systems to study molecular mechanisms involved in disease onset and progression. In our current study, we applied a novel 3D in vitro model of the human cornea comprising of epithelial, stromal, and neuronal components cultured in silk scaffolds to study the pathological effects of hyperglycemia on development of diabetic corneal neuropathy. Specifically, exposure to sustained levels of high glucose, ranging from 35 mM to 45 mM, were applied to determine concentration-dependent effects on nerve morphology, length and density of axons, and expression of metabolic enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. By comparing these metrics to in vivo studies, we have developed a functional 3D in vitro model for diabetic corneal neuropathy as a means to investigate corneal pathophysiology resulting from prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia."

It is hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation influences metabolic profile of these patients and indirectly might affect fertility and the outcomes. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), metabolic profiles, and gene expression of insulin and lipid metabolism in infertile women with PCOS who were candidate for in vitro fertilization (IVF). METHODS: This study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 40 infertile women, aged 18-40 years, diagnosed with PCOS and was candidate for IVF. Participants were randomly assigned into two intervention groups for receiving either 50,000 IU vitamin D or placebo (n = 20 each group) every other week for 8 weeks. Gene expression for insulin and lipid metabolism was conducted using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of women with PCOS, via RT-PCR method. RESULTS: Vitamin D supplementation led to a significant reduction in serum AMH (- 0.7 +/- 1.2 vs. - 0.1 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, P = 0.02), insulin levels (- 1.4 +/- 1.6 vs. -0.3 +/- 0.9 muIU/mL, P = 0.007), homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance (- 0.3 +/- 0.3 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.2, P = 0.008), and a significant increase in quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+ 0.009 +/- 0.01 vs. + 0.001 +/- 0.004, P = 0.04), compared with the placebo. Moreover, following vitamin D supplementation there was a significant decrease in serum total- (- 5.1 +/- 12.6 vs. + 2.9 +/- 10.9 mg/dL, P = 0.03) and LDL-cholesterol levels (- 4.5 +/- 10.3 vs. + 2.5 +/- 10.6 mg/dL, P = 0.04) compared with the placebo. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings of this trial supported that 50,000 IU vitamin D supplementation every other week for 8 weeks had beneficial effects on insulin metabolism, and lipid profile of infertile women with PCOS who are candidate for IVF. These benefits might not be evident upon having sufficient vitamin D levels.

Here we describe powerful interdisciplinary approaches combining Drosophila genetics and physiology with human islet biology to address this fundamental gap in diabetes research. We identify Drosophila orthologs of T2D-risk genes that regulate insulin output. With human islets, we perform genetic studies and identify cognate human T2D-risk genes that regulate human beta cell function. Loss of BCL11A, a transcriptional regulator, in primary human islet cells leads to enhanced insulin secretion. Gene expression profiling reveals BCL11A-dependent regulation of multiple genes involved in insulin exocytosis. Thus, genetic and physiological systems described here advance the capacity to identify cell-specific T2D risk gene functions."

Hydrogels consisting of alginate, gelatin and Matrigel were used to provide a scaffold for a 3D arrangement of human alveolar A549 cells. A blend containing 20% Matrigel provided the optimal conditions for spatial distribution and viability of the printed cells. Infection of the 3D model with a seasonal influenza A strain resulted in widespread distribution of the virus and a clustered infection pattern that is also observed in the natural lung but not in two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, which demonstrates the advantage of 3D printed constructs over conventional culture conditions. The bioink supported viral replication and proinflammatory interferon release of the infected cells. We consider our strategy to be paradigmatic for the generation of humanized 3D tissue models by bioprinting to study infections and develop new antiviral strategies."

In the field of diabetes, the development of an islet-on-a-chip platform would have broad implications in understanding disease pathology and discovering potential therapies. Islet microphysiological systems are limited, however, by their poor cell survival and function in culture. A key factor that has been implicated in this decline is the disruption of islet-matrix interactions following isolation. Herein, we sought to recapitulate the in vivo peri-islet niche using decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels. Sourcing from porcine bladder, lung, and pancreas tissues, 3-D ECM hydrogels were generated, characterized, and validated using both rodent and human pancreatic islets. Optimized decellularization protocols resulted in hydrogels with distinctive viscoelastic properties that correlated to their matrix composition. The in situ 3-D encapsulation of human or rat islets within ECM hydrogels resulted in improved functional stability over standard culture conditions. Islet composition and morphology were also altered, with enhanced retention of islet-resident endothelial cells and the formation of cord-like structures or sprouts emerging from the islet spheroid. These supportive 3-D physiomimetic ECM hydrogels can be leveraged within microfluidic platforms for the long-term culture of islets."

        "abstract": "Placental inflammation, as a recognized cause of preterm birth and neonatal mortality, displays extensive placental involvement or damage with the presence of organisms. The inflammatory processes are complicated and tightly associated with increased inflammatory cytokine levels and innate immune activation. However, the deep study of the underlying mechanisms was limited by conventional cell and animal models because of great variations in the architecture and function of placenta. Here, we established a microengineered model of human placental barrier on the chip and investigated the associated inflammatory responses to bacterial infection. The multilayered design of the microdevice mimicked the microscopic structure in the fetal-maternal interfaces of human placenta, and the flow resembled the dynamic environment in the mother's body. Escherichia coli (E. coli), one of the predominant organisms found in fetal organs, were applied to the maternal side, modeling acute placental inflammation. The data demonstrated the complex responses including the increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines by trophoblasts and the adhesion of maternal macrophages following bacterial infection. Particularly, transplacental communication was observed between two placental cells, and implied the potential role of trophoblast in fetal inflammatory response syndrome in clinic. These complex responses are of potential significance to placental dysfunctions, even abnormal fetal development and preterm birth. Collectively, placental barrier-on-a-chip microdevice presents a simple platform to explore the complicated inflammatory responses in human placenta, and might help our understanding of the mechanisms underlying reproductive diseases."

        "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells retain the extraordinary capacity to differentiate into pancreatic beta cells. For this particular lineage, more effort is still required to stress the importance of developing an efficient, reproducible, easy, and cost-effective differentiation protocol to obtain more mature, homogeneous, and functional insulin-secreting cells. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate many cellular processes, including pancreatic differentiation. Some miRNAs are known to be preferentially expressed in islets. Of note, miR-375 and miR-7 are two of the most abundant pancreatic miRNAs, and they are necessary for proper pancreatic islet development. Here we provide new insight into specific miRNAs involved in pancreatic differentiation. We found that miR-7 is differentially expressed during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into a beta cell-like phenotype and that its modulation plays an important role in generating mature pancreatic beta cells. This strategy may be exploited to optimize the potential for in vitro differentiation of hESCs into insulin-producing beta-like cells for use in preclinical studies and future clinical applications as well as the prospective uses of miRNAs to improve this process."

        "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects 415 million people worldwide. This pathology is often associated with long-term complications, such as critical limb ischemia (CLI), which increases the risk of limb loss and mortality. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising option for the treatment of diabetes complications. Although MSCs are widely used in autologous cell-based therapy, their effects may be influenced by the constant crosstalk between the graft and the host, which could affect the MSC fate potential. In this context, we previously reported that MSCs derived from diabetic patients with CLI have a defective phenotype that manifests as reduced fibrinolytic activity, thereby enhancing the thrombotic risk and compromising patient safety. Here, we found that MSCs derived from diabetic patients with CLI not only exhibit a prothrombotic profile but also have altered multi-differentiation potential, reduced proliferation, and inhibited migration and homing to sites of inflammation. We further demonstrated that this aberrant cell phenotype is reversed by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB, indicating that PDGF signaling is a key regulator of MSC functionality. These findings provide an attractive approach to improve the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in autologous therapy for diabetic patients."

Recent work has demonstrated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) as a viable regenerative cell source for tissue-specific organoid engineering. This is especially relevant for engineering islet organoids, due to the recent advances in generating functional beta-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells. In this study, we report specific engineering of regenerative islet organoids of precise size and cellular heterogeneity, using a novel hydrogel system, Amikagel. Amikagel facilitated controlled and spontaneous aggregation of human embryonic stem cell derived pancreatic progenitor cells (hESC-PP) into robust homogeneous spheroids. This platform further allowed fine control over the integration of multiple cell populations to produce heterogeneous spheroids, which is a necessity for complex organoid engineering. Amikagel induced hESC-PP spheroid formation enhanced pancreatic islet-specific Pdx-1 and NKX6.1 gene and protein expression, while also increasing the percentage of committed population. hESC-PP spheroids were further induced towards mature beta-like cells which demonstrated increased Beta-cell specific INS1 gene and C-peptide protein expression along with functional insulin production in response to in vitro glucose challenge. Further integration of hESC-PP with biologically relevant supporting endothelial cells resulted in multicellular organoids which demonstrated spontaneous maturation towards islet-specific INS1 gene and C-peptide protein expression along with a significantly developed extracellular matrix support system. These findings establish Amikagel -facilitated platform ideal for islet organoid engineering."

        "abstract": "Excess adiposity in obese inhibits negatively impacts immune function and host defence. Obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade, chronic inflammation in addition to disturbed levels of circulating nutrients and metabolic hormones. The impact of metabolic abnormalities on obesity-related co-morbidities has undergone intense scrutiny over the past decades. Thus, treatment of obesity and its associated immune-mediated diseases is challenging due to impaired function of leptin system. These disorders are managed through antibiotics and by cytokines replacement. However, the effectiveness of cytokines coupled to the complexity of the cytokine network leads to severe side-effects, which can still occur after careful preclinical evaluation. In addition, synthetic immunotherapeutics carry a degree of risk, time-consuming and expensive. Hence, the complexity of existing therapy and adverse effects emphasizes the need for an alternative approach for the management of immune dysfunction associated with obesity. Computer-aided small molecule antibody technology has been successful in the design of novel biologicals for the diagnosis of diseases and therapeutic interventions. In this study, the crystal structure of leptin receptor (LEPR) complex with monoclonal antibody (9F8 Fab) was explored to predict Ag-Ab interactions using bioinformatics tools. The LEPR of complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops were mutated with published positive control residues of Ser, Thr, Tyr, Trp, and Phe to design a set of 678 peptides which were evaluated through Ag-peptide docking, binding free-energies, and interaction energies. Thus, hypothesized novel peptides can be explored as clinically applicable antagonists for the treatment of obesity and associated immune-mediated diseases."

METHODS: A metabolomics analysis using the (1)H-NMR-based, non-targeted metabolomic approach was conducted to determine the urinary metabolomic fingerprint of T2D compared with non-T2D participants in the PREDIMED trial. The discriminant metabolite fingerprint was subjected to logistic regression analysis and ROC analyses to establish and to assess the multi-metabolite signature of T2D prevalence, respectively. Metabotypes associated with T2D were identified using the k-means algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 33 metabolites were significantly different (P<0.05) between T2D and non-T2D participants. The multi-metabolite signature of T2D comprised high levels of methylsuccinate, alanine, dimethylglycine and guanidoacetate, and reduced levels of glutamine, methylguanidine, 3-hydroxymandelate and hippurate, and had a 96.4% AUC, which was higher than the metabolites on their own and glucose. Amino-acid and carbohydrate metabolism were the main metabolic alterations in T2D, and various metabotypes were identified in the studied population. Among T2D participants, those with a metabotype of higher levels of phenylalanine, phenylacetylglutamine, p-cresol and acetoacetate had significantly higher levels of plasma glucose. CONCLUSION: The multi-metabolite signature of T2D highlights the altered metabolic fingerprint associated mainly with amino-acid, carbohydrate and microbiota metabolism. Metabotypes identified in this patient population could be related to higher risk of long-term cardiovascular events and therefore require further studies. Metabolomics is a useful tool for elucidating the metabolic complexity and interindividual variation in T2D towards the development of stratified precision nutrition and medicine.

The inability to mimic the complexity of the liver using cell lines and regular primary human hepatocyte (PHH) cultures pose significant limitations for studying host/pathogen interactions. Here, we describe a 3D microfluidic PHH system permissive to HBV infection, which can be maintained for at least 40 days. This system enables the recapitulation of all steps of the HBV life cycle, including the replication of patient-derived HBV and the maintenance of HBV cccDNA. We show that innate immune and cytokine responses following infection with HBV mimic those observed in HBV-infected patients, thus allowing the dissection of pathways important for immune evasion and validation of biomarkers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the co-culture of PHH with other non-parenchymal cells enables the identification of the cellular origin of immune effectors, thus providing a valuable preclinical platform for HBV research."

Obesity is peculiar to humans, as it is associated with lifestyle and diet, and so difficult to reproduce in animal models. Here we describe a model of human central adiposity based on a 3-tissue system consisting of a series of interconnected fluidic modules. Given the causal link between obesity and systemic inflammation, we focused primarily on pro-inflammatory markers, examining the similarities and differences between the 3-tissue model and evidence from human studies in the literature. When challenged with high levels of adiposity, the in-vitro system manifests cardiovascular stress through expression of E-selectin and von Willebrand factor as well as systemic inflammation (expressing IL-6 and MCP-1) as observed in humans. Interestingly, most of the responses are dependent on the synergic interaction between adiposity and the presence of multiple tissue types. The set-up has the potential to reduce animal experiments in obesity research and may help unravel specific cellular mechanisms which underlie tissue response to nutritional overload."

We have developed a human microfluidic two-organ-chip model to study pancreatic islet-liver cross-talk based on insulin and glucose regulation. We have established a robust co-culture of human pancreatic islet microtissues and liver spheroids maintaining functional responses up to 15 days in an insulin-free medium. Functional coupling, demonstrated by insulin released from the islet microtissues in response to a glucose load applied in glucose tolerance tests on different days, promoted glucose uptake by the liver spheroids. Co-cultures maintained postprandial glucose concentrations in the circulation whereas glucose levels remained elevated in both single cultures. Thus, insulin secreted into the circulation stimulated glucose uptake by the liver spheroids, while the latter, in the absence of insulin, did not consume glucose as efficiently. As the glucose concentration fell, insulin secretion subsided, demonstrating a functional feedback loop between the liver and the insulin-secreting islet microtissues. Finally, inter-laboratory validation verified robustness and reproducibility. Further development of this model using tools inducing impaired glucose regulation should provide a unique in vitro system emulating human type 2 diabetes mellitus."

However, the mechanisms in human lung tissue that provoke this increase in fatality are unknown and therapeutic immune modulatory options are lacking.We established a human lung ex vivo co-infection model to investigate innate immune related mechanisms contributing to the susceptibility of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia.We revealed that type I and III interferon (IFN) inhibits Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced interleukin (IL)-1beta release. The lack of IL-1beta resulted in the repression of bacterially induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) liberation. Specific inhibition of IFN receptor I and III-associated tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) completely restored the S. pneumoniae-induced IL-1beta-GM-CSF axis, leading to a reduction of bacterial growth. A preceding IAV infection of the human alveolus leads to a type I and III IFN-dependent blockade of the early cytokines IL-1beta and GM-CSF, which are key for orchestrating an adequate innate immune response against bacteria. Their virally induced suppression may result in impaired bacterial clearance and alveolar repair.Pharmacological inhibition of Tyk2 might be a new treatment option to sustain beneficial endogenous GM-CSF levels in IAV-associated secondary bacterial pneumonia."

However, cadaveric pancreas is scarcely available for clinical use, limiting this approach. As such, there is a great need to identify alternative sources of clinically usable pancreatic tissues. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from patients with T1D to generate glucose-responsive, insulin-producing cells (IPCs) via 3D culture. Initially, T1D iPS cells were resistant to differentiation, but transient demethylation treatment significantly enhanced IPC yield. The cells responded to high-glucose stimulation by secreting insulin in vitro The shape, size, and number of their granules, as observed by transmission electron microscopy, were identical to those found in cadaveric beta cells. When the IPCs were transplanted into immunodeficient mice that had developed streptozotocin-induced diabetes, they promoted a dramatic decrease in hyperglycemia, causing the mice to become normoglycemic within 28 days. None of the mice died or developed teratomas. Because the cells are derived from \"self,\" immunosuppression is not required, providing a much safer and reliable treatment option for T1D patients. Moreover, these cells can be used for drug screening, thereby accelerating drug discovery. In conclusion, our approach eliminates the need for cadaveric pancreatic tissue."

Identification of subjects that may benefit from these drugs is challenging because of the extensive heterogeneity of CFTR mutations, as well as other unknown factors that contribute to individual drug efficacy. Here, we describe a simple and relatively rapid assay for measuring individual CFTR function and response to CFTR modulators in vitro. Three dimensional (3D) epithelial organoids are grown from rectal biopsies in standard organoid medium. Once established, the organoids can be bio-banked for future analysis. For the assay, 30-80 organoids are seeded in 96-well plates in basement membrane matrix and are then exposed to drugs. One day later, the organoids are stained with calcein green, and forskolin-induced swelling is monitored by confocal live cell microscopy at 37  degrees C. Forskolin-induced swelling is fully CFTR-dependent and is sufficiently sensitive and precise to allow for discrimination between the drug responses of individuals with different and even identical CFTR mutations. In vitro swell responses correlate with the clinical response to therapy. This assay provides a cost-effective approach for the identification of drug-responsive individuals, independent of their CFTR mutations. It may also be instrumental in the development of future CFTR modulators."

Here, using coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) as a prototype enterovirus strain, we demonstrate that human enterovirus infection, replication and infectious virus production can be analyzed in vitro in a human Gut-on-a-Chip microfluidic device that supports culture of highly differentiated human villus intestinal epithelium under conditions of fluid flow and peristalsis-like motions. When CVB1 was introduced into the epithelium-lined intestinal lumen of the device, virions entered the epithelium, replicated inside the cells producing detectable cytopathic effects (CPEs), and both infectious virions and inflammatory cytokines were released in a polarized manner from the cell apex, as they could be detected in the effluent from the epithelial microchannel. When the virus was introduced via a basal route of infection (by inoculating virus into fluid flowing through a parallel lower 'vascular' channel separated from the epithelial channel by a porous membrane), significantly lower viral titers, decreased CPEs, and delayed caspase-3 activation were observed; however, cytokines continued to be secreted apically. The presence of continuous fluid flow through the epithelial lumen also resulted in production of a gradient of CPEs consistent with the flow direction. Thus, the human Gut-on-a-Chip may provide a suitable in vitro model for enteric virus infection and for investigating mechanisms of enterovirus pathogenesis."

For this purpose, we established a multistep protocol by adding platelet-rich plasma (PRP) that induce the hiPSCs into insulin-producing cells (IPCs). We present here a differentiation protocol consisting of five stages in two groups including protocol with PRP and without PRP. Charac-teristics of derived IPCs in both groups were evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels, cell cycle and viability in the end stage of cell differentiation. The in vitro studies indicated the treatment of hiPSCs in the protocol with PRP resulting in differentiated cells with strong characteristics of IPCs including islet-like cells, the expression of mature and functional pancreatic beta cell specific marker genes. In addition to these pancreatic specific markers were detected by immunochemistry and Western blot. Our differentiated cells in two groups secreted insulin and C-peptide in a glucose stimulation test by ELISA showing in vitro functional. The results of the cell cycle assay confirmed that differentiation has been done. We reported for the first time that PRP might be ideal additive in the culture medium to induce pancreatic differentiation in the hiPSCs. This study provides a new approach to investigate the role of PRP in pancreatic differentiation protocols and enhance the feasibility of using patient-specific iPSCs and autologous PRP for future beta cells replacement therapies for T1DM.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity before pregnancy is associated with impaired metabolic status of the mother and the offspring later in life. These adverse effects have been attributed to epigenetic changes in utero, but little is known about the role of placental metabolism and its contribution to fetal development. OBJECTIVES: We examined the impact of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity on the expression of genes involved in placental lipid metabolism in lean and obese women. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Seventy-three lean and obese women with healthy pregnancy were recruited at term elective cesarean delivery. Metabolic parameters were measured on maternal venous blood samples. Expression of 88 genes involved in lipid metabolism was measured in whole placenta tissue. Proteins of genes differently expressed in response to maternal obesity were quantified, correlated with maternal parameters and immunolocalized in placenta sections. Isolated primary trophoblasts were used for in vitro assays. RESULTS: Triglyceride (TG) content was increased in placental tissue of obese (1.10, CI 1.04-1.24 mg g(-1), P<0.05) vs lean (0.84, CI 0.72-1.02 mg g(-1)) women. Among target genes examined, six showed positive correlation (P<0.05) with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, namely ATGL (PNPLA2), FATP1 (SLC27A1), FATP3 (SLC27A3), PLIN2, PPARG and CGI-58 (ABHD5). CGI-58 protein abundance was twofold higher (P<0.001) in placentas of obese vs lean women. CGI-58 protein levels correlated positively with maternal insulin levels and pre-pregnancy body mass index (R=0.63, P<0.001 and R=0.64, P<0.001, respectively). CGI-58 and PLIN2 were primarily located in the syncytiotrophoblast and, were upregulated (1.38- and 500-fold, respectively) upon oleic acid and insulin treatment of cultured trophoblast cells. CONCLUSION: Pre-gravid obesity significantly modifies the expression of placental genes related to transport and storage of neutral lipids. We propose that the upregulation of CGI-58, a master regulator of TG hydrolysis, contributes to the turnover of intracellular lipids in placenta of obese women, and is tightly regulated by metabolic factors of the mother."

A single nucleotide substitution, -13910 C>T, the first causal variant to be identified, accounts for lactase persistence over most of Europe. Located in a region shown to have enhancer function in vitro, it causes increased activity of the LCT promoter in Caco-2 cells, and altered transcription factor binding. Three other variants in close proximity, -13907 C>G, -13915 T>C and -14010 G>C, were later shown to behave in a similar manner. Here, we study four further candidate functional variants. Two, -14009 T>G and -14011 C>T, adjacent to the well-studied -14010 G>C variant, also have a clear effect on promoter activity upregulation as assessed by transfection assays, but notably are involved in different molecular interactions. The results for the two other variants (-14028 T>C, -13779 G>C) were suggestive of function, -14028*C showing a clear change in transcription factor binding, but no obvious effect in transfections, while -13779*G showed greater effect in transfections but less on transcription factor binding.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD). Decreased endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) number plays a pivotal role in reduced endothelial repair and development of CVD. We aimed to determine if cardioprotective effect of metformin is mediated by increasing circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs), pro-angiogenic cells (PACs) and decreasing circulating endothelial cells (cECs) count whilst maintaining unchanged glycemic control. METHODS: This study was an open label and parallel standard treatment study. Twenty-three type 1 diabetes patients without overt CVD were treated with metformin for 8 weeks (treatment group-TG). They were matched with nine type 1 diabetes patients on standard treatment (SG) and 23 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HC). Insulin dose was adjusted to keep unchanged glycaemic control. cEPCs and cECs counts were determined by flow cytometry using surface markers CD45(dim)CD34(+)VEGFR-2(+) and CD45(dim)CD133(-)CD34(+)CD144(+) respectively. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured to assess changes in PACs number, function and colony forming units (CFU-Hill's colonies). RESULTS: At baseline TG had lower cEPCs, PACs, CFU-Hills' colonies and PACs adhesion versus HC (p < 0.001-all variables) and higher cECs versus HC (p = 0.03). Metformin improved cEPCs, PACs, CFU-Hill's colonies number, cECs and PACs adhesion (p < 0.05-all variables) to levels seen in HC whilst HbA1c (one-way ANOVA p = 0.78) and glucose variability (average glucose, blood glucose standard deviation, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion, continuous overall net glycaemic action and area under curve) remained unchanged. No changes were seen in any variables in SG. There was an inverse correlation between CFU-Hill's colonies with cECs. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin has potential cardio-protective effect through improving cEPCs, CFU-Hill's colonies, cECs, PACs count and function independently of hypoglycaemic effect. This finding needs to be confirmed by long term cardiovascular outcome studies in type 1 diabetes. Trial registration ISRCTN26092132."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease worldwide, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which may progress to cirrhosis, eventually leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC ranks as the third highest cause of cancer-related death globally, requiring an early diagnosis of NAFLD as a potential risk factor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD are still under investigation. So far, many in vitro studies on NAFLD have been hampered by the limitations of 2D culture systems, in which cells rapidly lose tissue-specific functions. The present liver-on-a-chip approach aims at filling the gap between conventional in vitro models, often scarcely predictive of in vivo conditions, and animal models, potentially biased by their xenogeneic nature. METHODS: HepG2 cells were cultured into a microfluidically perfused device under free fatty acid (FFA) supplementation, namely palmitic and oleic acid, for 24h and 48h. The device mimicked the endothelial-parenchymal interface of a liver sinusoid, allowing the diffusion of nutrients and removal of waste products similar to the hepatic microvasculature. Assessment of intracellular lipid accumulation, cell viability/cytotoxicity and oxidative stress due to the FFA overload, was performed by high-content analysis methodologies using fluorescence-based functional probes. RESULTS: The chip enables gradual and lower intracellular lipid accumulation, higher hepatic cell viability and minimal oxidative stress in microfluidic dynamic vs. 2D static cultures, thus mimicking the chronic condition of steatosis observed in vivo more closely. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the liver-on-a-chip system provides a suitable culture microenvironment, representing a more reliable model compared to 2D cultures for investigating NAFLD pathogenesis. Hence, our system is amongst the first in vitro models of human NAFLD developed within a microfluidic device in a sinusoid-like fashion, endowing a more permissive tissue-like microenvironment for long-term culture of hepatic cells than conventional 2D static cultures."

The generation of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells from pluripotent stem cells in vitro provides an unprecedented cell source for personal drug discovery and cell transplantation therapy in diabetes. A new five-step protocol was introduced in this study, effectively induced hiPSCs to differentiate into glucose-responsive insulin-producing cells. This process mimics in vivo pancreatic organogenesis by directing cells through stages resembling definitive endoderm, primitive gut-tube endoderm, posterior foregut, pancreatic endoderm, and endocrine precursor. Each stage of differentiation were characterized by stage-specific markers. The produced cells exhibited many properties of functional beta-cells, including expression of critical beta-cells transcription factors, the potency to secrete C-peptide in response to high levels of glucose and the presence of mature endocrine secretory granules. This high efficient differentiation protocol, established in this study, yielded 79.18% insulin-secreting cells which were responsive to glucose five times higher than the basal level. These hiPSCs-derived glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells might provide a promising approach for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 2616-2625, 2017.

These organoids recapitulate key features of human cortical development, including progenitor zone organization, neurogenesis, gene expression, and, notably, a distinct human-specific outer radial glia cell layer. We also developed protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. Finally, we employed the forebrain organoid platform to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Quantitative analyses revealed preferential, productive infection of neural progenitors with either African or Asian ZIKV strains. ZIKV infection leads to increased cell death and reduced proliferation, resulting in decreased neuronal cell-layer volume resembling microcephaly. Together, our brain-region-specific organoids and SpinOmega provide an accessible and versatile platform for modeling human brain development and disease and for compound testing, including potential ZIKV antiviral drugs."

We sought to develop and characterize a novel human liver cell line (LIV0APOLY) to establish a model of lipid accumulation using a physiological mixture of fatty acids under low- and high-glucose conditions. LIV0APOLY cells were compared with a well-established cell line (HepG2) and, where possible, primary human hepatocytes. LIV0APOLY cells were found to proliferate and express some mature liver markers and were wild type for the PNPLA3 (rs738409) gene, whereas HepG2 cells carried the Ile(148)Met variant that is positively associated with liver fat content. Intracellular triglyceride content was higher in HepG2 than in LIV0APOLY cells; exposure to high glucose and/or exogenous fatty acids increased intracellular triglyceride in both cell lines. Triglyceride concentrations in media were higher from LIV0APOLY compared with HepG2 cells. Culturing LIV0APOLY cells in high glucose increased a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress and attenuated insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation whereas low glucose and exogenous fatty acids increased AMPK phosphorylation. Although LIV0APOLY cells and primary hepatocytes stored similar amounts of exogenous fatty acids as triglyceride, more exogenous fatty acids were partitioned toward oxidation in the LIV0APOLY cells than in primary hepatocytes. LIV0APOLY cells offer the potential to be a renewable cellular model for studying the effects of exogenous metabolic substrates on fatty acid partitioning; however, their usefulness as a model of lipoprotein metabolism needs to be further explored."

        "abstract": "The airways of patients with cystic fibrosis are colonized with diverse bacterial communities that change dynamically during pediatric years and early adulthood. Staphylococcus aureus is the most prevalent pathogen during early childhood, but during late teens and early adulthood, a shift in microbial composition occurs leading to Pseudomonas aeruginosa community predominance in  approximately 50% of adults. We developed a robust dual-bacterial in vitro coculture system of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus on monolayers of human bronchial epithelial cells homozygous for the DeltaF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation to better model the mechanisms of this interaction. We show that P. aeruginosa drives the S. aureus expression profile from that of aerobic respiration to fermentation. This shift is dependent on the production of both 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) and siderophores by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, S. aureus-produced lactate is a carbon source that P. aeruginosa preferentially consumes over medium-supplied glucose. We find that initially S. aureus and P. aeruginosa coexist; however, over extended coculture P. aeruginosa reduces S. aureus viability, also in an HQNO- and P. aeruginosa siderophore-dependent manner. Interestingly, S. aureus small-colony-variant (SCV) genetic mutant strains, which have defects in their electron transport chain, experience reduced killing by P. aeruginosa compared to their wild-type parent strains; thus, SCVs may provide a mechanism for persistence of S. aureus in the presence of P. aeruginosa. We propose that the mechanism of P. aeruginosa-mediated killing of S. aureus is multifactorial, requiring HQNO and P. aeruginosa siderophores as well as additional genetic, environmental, and nutritional factors. IMPORTANCE: In individuals with cystic fibrosis, Staphylococcus aureus is the primary respiratory pathogen during childhood. During adulthood, Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominates and correlates with worse patient outcome. The mechanism(s) by which P. aeruginosa outcompetes or kills S. aureus is not well understood. We describe an in vitro dual-bacterial species coculture system on cystic fibrosis-derived airway cells, which models interactions relevant to patients with cystic fibrosis. Further, we show that molecules produced by P. aeruginosa additively induce a transition of S. aureus metabolism from aerobic respiration to fermentation and eventually lead to loss of S. aureus viability. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of P. aeruginosa community predominance can provide new therapeutic targets and approaches to impede this microbial community transition and subsequent patient worsening."

In this study, we developed and characterized an intra-arterial cell suspension containing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for the treatment of CLI. Equally, the stability of cells was studied in order to evaluate the optimal conditions of storage that guarantee the viability from cell processing to the administration phase. Effects of various factors, including excipients, storage temperature and time were evaluated to analyze the survival of hMSCs in the finished medicinal product. The viability of hMSCs in different packaging media was studied for 60 h at 4  degrees C. The best medium to maintain hMSCs viability was then selected to test storage conditions (4, 8, 25 and 37  degrees C; 60 h). The results showed that at 4  degrees C the viability was maintained above 80% for 48 h, at 8  degrees C decreased slightly, whereas at room temperature and 37  degrees C decreased drastically. Its biocompatibility was assessed by cell morphology and cell viability assays. During stability study, the stored cells did not show any change in their phenotypic or genotypic characteristics and physicochemical properties remained constant, the ability to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes and sterility requirements were also unaltered. Finally, our paper proposes a packing media composed of albumin 20%, glucose 5% and Ringer's lactate at a concentration of 1x10(6) cells/mL, which must be stored at 4  degrees C as the most suitable to maintain cell viability (>80%) and without altering their characteristics for more than 48 h."

This adverse effect, which contrasts with the reported antithrombotic properties of MSCs, may stem from the diabetic environment that alters the fibrinolytic activity of AdMSCs, thereby increasing the probability of developing thrombosis. Here, we confirm this premise by demonstrating that diabetic AdMSCs cultured in the presence of blood sera expressed and released higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, reduced levels of tissue plasminogen activator, and lower d-dimer formation compared with nondiabetic AdMSCs. Thus, to establish an appropriate cell therapy for diabetic patients, we recommend including new preclinical safety tests, such as the d-dimer and/or the tissue plasminogen activator-to-plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ratio tests, to assess fibrinolytic activity of cells before implantation."

Here we apply this technology to study primary intestinal organoids of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by mutations in CFTR, encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Forskolin-induced swelling of in vitro-expanded human control and cystic fibrosis organoids corresponds quantitatively with forskolin-induced anion currents in freshly excised ex vivo rectal biopsies. Function of the CFTR F508del mutant protein is restored by incubation at low temperature, as well as by CFTR-restoring compounds. This relatively simple and robust assay will facilitate diagnosis, functional studies, drug development and personalized medicine approaches in cystic fibrosis."

Deficiency of the human enzyme (hGALE) is associated with type III galactosemia. The majority of known mutations in hGALE are missense and private thus making clinical guidance difficult. In this study a bioinformatics approach was employed to analyse the structural effects due to each mutation using both the UDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine bound structures of the wild-type protein. Changes to the enzyme's overall stability, substrate/cofactor binding and propensity to aggregate were also predicted. These predictions were found to be in good agreement with previous in vitro and in vivo studies when data was available and allowed for the differentiation of those mutants that severely impair the enzyme's activity against UDP-galactose. Next this combination of techniques were applied to another twenty-six reported variants from the NCBI dbSNP database that have yet to be studied to predict their effects. This identified p.I14T, p.R184H and p.G302R as likely severely impairing mutations. Although severely impaired mutants were predicted to decrease the protein's stability, overall predicted stability changes only weakly correlated with residual activity against UDP-galactose. This suggests other protein functions such as changes in cofactor and substrate binding may also contribute to the mechanism of impairment. Finally this investigation shows that this combination of different in silico approaches is useful in predicting the effects of mutations and that it could be the basis of an initial prediction of likely clinical severity when new hGALE mutants are discovered."

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The murine adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 is well characterised and used widely, while the human pre-adipocyte cell strain, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS), requires validation for use in human studies. Obesity is currently estimated to account for up to 41 % of the worldwide cancer burden. A human in vitro model system is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for this poorly understood association. This work investigates the relevance of the SGBS cell strain for obesity and cancer research in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 and SGBS were differentiated according to standard protocols. Morphology was assessed by Oil Red O staining. Adipocyte-specific gene expression was measured by qPCR and biochemical function was assessed by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity. Differential gene expression in oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE33 following co-culture with SGBS or primary omental human adipocytes was investigated using Human Cancer Profiler qPCR arrays. RESULTS: During the process of differentiation, SGBS expressed higher levels of adipocyte-specific transcripts and fully differentiated SGBS expressed more similar morphology, transcript levels and biochemical function to primary omental adipocytes, relative to 3T3-L1. Co-culture with SGBS or primary omental adipocytes induced differential expression of genes involved in adhesion (ITGB3), angiogenesis (IGF1, TEK, TNF, VEGFA), apoptosis (GZMA, TERT) and invasion and metastasis (MMP9, TIMP3) in OE33 tumour cells. CONCLUSIONS: Comparable adipocyte-specific gene expression, biochemical function and a shared induced gene signature in co-cultured OE33 cells indicate that SGBS is a relevant in vitro model for obesity and cancer research in humans."

Suboptimal responses to the available medical and surgical treatments are common in these patients, who also demonstrate limited vascular homeostasis. Neovasculogenesis induced by stem cell therapy could be a useful approach for these patients. Neovasculogenesis and clinical improvement were compared at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BMMNC) transplantation in diabetic patients with peripheral artery disease. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial administration of autologous BMMNCs (100-400 x 10(6) cells) in 20 diabetic patients with severe below-the-knee arterial ischemia. Although the time course of clinical effects differed among patients, after 12 months of follow-up all patients presented a notable improvement in the Rutherford-Becker classification, the University of Texas diabetic wound scales, and the Ankle-Brachial Index in the target limb. The clinical outcome was consistent with neovasculogenesis, which was assessed at 3 months by digital subtraction angiography and quantified by MetaMorph software. Unfortunately, local cell therapy in the target limb had no beneficial effect on the high mortality rate in these patients. In diabetic patients with critical limb ischemia, intra-arterial perfusion of BMMNCs is a safe procedure that generates a significant increase in the vascular network in ischemic areas and promotes remarkable clinical improvement."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wilson disease is a severe disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a copper-transporting adenosine triphosphatase. The disease presents with a variable phenotype that complicates the diagnostic process and treatment. Little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to the different phenotypes of the disease. METHODS: We analyzed 28 variants of ATP7B from patients with Wilson disease that affected different functional domains; the gene products were expressed using the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 cells. Protein function was analyzed by measuring catalytic activity and copper ((64)Cu) transport into vesicles. We studied intracellular localization of variants of ATP7B that had measurable transport activities and were tagged with green fluorescent protein in mammalian cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: Properties of ATP7B variants with pathogenic amino-acid substitution varied greatly even if substitutions were in the same functional domain. Some variants had complete loss of catalytic and transport activity, whereas others lost transport activity but retained phosphor-intermediate formation or had partial losses of activity. In mammalian cells, transport-competent variants differed in stability and subcellular localization. CONCLUSIONS: Variants in ATP7B associated with Wilson disease disrupt the protein's transport activity, result in its mislocalization, and reduce its stability. Single assays are insufficient to accurately predict the effects of ATP7B variants the function of its product and development of Wilson disease. These findings will contribute to our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation and mechanisms of disease pathogenesis."

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: While metabolic syndrome (MetS) and diabetes confer greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, recent evidence suggests that individuals with these conditions have a wide range of risk. We evaluated whether screening for coronary artery calcium (CAC) and carotid intimal-medial thickness (CIMT) can improve CVD risk stratification over traditional risk factors (RFs) in people with MetS and diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed CAC and CIMT in 6,603 people aged 45-84 years in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Cox regression examined the association of CAC and CIMT with coronary heart disease (CHD) and CVD over 6.4 years in MetS and diabetes. RESULTS: Of the subjects, 1,686 (25%) had MetS but no diabetes and 881 (13%) had diabetes. Annual CHD event rates were 1.0% among MetS and 1.5% for diabetes. Ethnicity and RF-adjusted hazard ratios for CHD for CAC 1-99 to >/=400 vs. 0 in subjects with neither MetS nor diabetes ranged from 2.6 to 9.5; in those with MetS, they ranged from 3.9 to 11.9; and in those with diabetes, they ranged from 2.9 to 6.2 (all P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). Findings were similar for CVD. CAC increased the C-statistic for events (P < 0.001) over RFs and CIMT in each group while CIMT added negligibly to prediction over RFs. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with MetS or diabetes have low risks for CHD when CAC or CIMT is not increased. Prediction of CHD and CVD events is improved by CAC more than by CIMT. Screening for CAC or CIMT can stratify risk in people with MetS and diabetes and support the latest recommendations regarding CAC screening in those with diabetes."

        "abstract": "The posttranslational modification of proteins by sugars has been demonstrated in diabetes and classical galactosemia. In diabetes, the glycation process occurs as a result of d-glucose nonenzymatically reacting with proteins such as albumin and hemoglobin, used today as important tools to monitor the efficiency of dietary control and therapy during treatment of diabetes. In classical galactosemia, d-galactose contributes to the formation of glycated proteins as well, suggesting that, akin to diabetes with glucated proteins, the monitoring of galactated proteins may facilitate management of patients with galactosemia. The objectives of this study were (i) to galactate human serum albumin (HSA) in vitro; (ii) to determine, by a sodium borohydride-dependent mass peptide mapping method, the galactation sites in HSA; and (iii) to compare HSA's galactation sites with the protein's reported glucation sites. Treatment of galactated HSA with sodium borohydride stabilized the condensed sugars on the protein and yielded discrete fragmentation patterns by tandem mass spectrometry, allowing reliable identification of HSA's galactation sites. Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry, in combination with tandem mass spectrometry, revealed that the principal sites of galactation in HSA were the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues 12, 233, 281/276, 414, and 525. Lysyl residues 12, 233, 276, and 525 were previously reported as privileged sites for the nonenzymatic binding of d-glucose with HSA."

Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are important in immunity and disease. The aim of this work is to determine whether hyperglycemia or insulin alters IL-12 response in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: The PBMCs from 15 type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and 13 healthy controls were used for cell analysis and culture with or without treatment by glucose and insulin or stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 1, 2, and 3 days. RESULTS: The IL-12 level in the supernatant of LPS-stimulated PBMCs in the DM patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls from day 1 to day 3. Kinetic IL-12 responses of LPS-stimulated PBMCs in the DM patients from day 1 to day 3 were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. The LPS-stimulated PBMCs under glucose treatment produced more IL-12 in DM patients but this did not happen in healthy controls. In DM patients, insulin could suppress IL-12 production from stimulated PBMCs but not with additional glucose treatment. CONCLUSION: The PBMCs of LPS-treated DM patients produced more IL-12 than that of LPS-treated healthy controls did. Hyperglycemia influenced IL-12 response from PBMCs in DM patients to some degree during infection."

        "abstract": "One of the major obstacles in drug discovery is the lack of in vitro three-dimensional (3D) models that can capture more complex features of a disease.Here we established a in vitro physiological model of the metabolic syndrome (MS) using cell-assembly technique (CAT), which can assemble cells into designated places to form complex 3D structures. Adipose-derived stromal (ADS) cells were assembled with gelatin/alginate/fibrinogen. Fibrin was employed as an effective material to regulate ADS cell differentiation and self-organization along with other methods. ADS cells differentiated into adipocytes and endothelial cells, meanwhile, the cells were induced to self-organize into an analogous tissue structure. Pancreatic islets were then deposited at designated locations and constituted the adipoinsular axis with adipocytes. Analysis of the factors involved in energy metabolism showed that this system could capture more pathological features of MS. Drugs known to have effects on MS showed accordant effects in this system, indicating that the model has potential in MS drug discovery. Overall, this study demonstrated that cell differentiation and self-organization can be regulated by techniques combined with CAT. The model presented could result in a better understanding of the pathogenesis of MS and the development of new technologies for drug discovery."

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM), one of the commonest metabolic disorders, can impair the function of cells involved in cellular and/or humoral immunity. This study sought to define potential effects upon cell-mediated immune cells due to an acute hyperglycemic state (in vitro) for comparison against those that might be attributable to a diabetic phenotype itself. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from ten diabetic patients (5 with Type I disease and 5 with Type II) and 10 healthy controls. The cells were then challenged with 1 of 3 different mitogens (concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen) in the presence of differing glucose concentrations (0, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/dl), and proliferative responses assessed. Neutrophils (PMNC) from the blood samples, exposed to the same experimental conditions, were analyzed for respiratory burst activity using nitroblue tetrazolium. The results indicated that there was significant inhibition of the proliferative responses to mitogens among the stimulated PBMC and in respiratory burst activity among the PMNC obtained from the diabetic patients. However, these effects were not affected by either the added presence of increasing amounts of exogenous glucose, the type of diabetes the patients had, the length of time the patient had had the disease, or whether or not the patients had been receiving insulin treatments. In contrast, the PBMC from healthy individuals appeared to display dose-trend decreases in responsiveness to mitogens; interestingly, similar effects on their PMNC were not evident. It was thus concluded that in situ ongoing repeated hyperglycemic states caused changes in cells of the immune system that could have been caused by repeated \"continuous\" exposures to excess sugar. Further studies are needed to more clearly identify hyperglycemia (sugar)-sensitive targets on/in these cells that could contribute to the appearance of the diabetic immunodeficiency in these types of patients."

The incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome X is increasing, and the cause(s) for this increasing incidence is not clear. Although genetics could play an important role in the higher prevalence of these diseases, it is not clear how genetic factors interact with environmental and dietary factors to increase their incidence. We performed gene expression profile in subjects with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without family history of these diseases. It was noted that genes involved in carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolism pathways, glycan of biosynthesis, metabolism of cofactors and vitamin pathways, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, signal transduction pathways, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, nervous system pathways, neurodegenerative disorders pathways are upregulated in obesity compared to healthy subjects. In contrast genes involved in cell adhesion molecules, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, insulin signaling and immune system pathways are downregulated in obese. Genes involved in signal transduction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, antigen processing and presentation, complement and coagulation cascades, axon guidance and neurodegenerative disorders pathways are upregulated in subjects with type 2 diabetes with family history of diabetes compared to those who are diabetic but with no family history. Genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, immune, nervous system, and metabolic disorders pathways are upregulated in those with diabetes with family history of diabetes compared to those with diabetes but with no family history. In contrast, genes involved in lipid and amino acid pathways, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, signal transduction, insulin signaling and PPAR signaling pathways are downregulated in subjects with diabetes with family history of diabetes. It was noted that genes involved in inflammatory pathway are differentially expressed both in obesity and type 2 diabetes. These results suggest that genes concerned with carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolic pathways, neuronal function and inflammation play a significant role in the pathobiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes."

We performed in vitro studies in a fecal incubation system to investigate the biochemical and bacteriological effects induced by different substances customarily used for the treatment of patients with PSE (lactose, lactulose and Neomycin). In vitro experiments showed that lactose and lactulose decreased aerobic flora counts and reduced the pH of fecal incubation.
